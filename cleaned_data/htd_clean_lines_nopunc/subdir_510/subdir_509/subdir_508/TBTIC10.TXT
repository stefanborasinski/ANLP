LITTLE JACK HORNER  GOODBYE THE BOBBSEY TWINS IN THE COUNTRY CHAPTER I THE INVITATION There goes the bell
Its the letter carrier
Let me answer
Freddie exclaimed
Oh let me
Its my turn this week
cried Flossie
But I see a blue envelope
Thats from Aunt Sarah
the brother cried
Meanwhile both children Freddie and Flossie were making all possible efforts to reach the front door which Freddie finally did by jumping over the little divan that stood in the way it being sweeping day
I beat you laughed the boy while his sister stood back acknowledging defeat
Well Dinah had everything in the way and anyhow maybe it was your turn
Mother is in the sewing room I guess
Flossie concluded and so the two started in search of the mother with the welcome letter from Aunt Sarah tight in Freddies chubby fist
Freddie and Flossie were the younger of the two pairs of twins that belonged to the Bobbsey family
The little ones were four years old both with light curls framing pretty dimpled faces and both being just fat enough to be goodnatured
The other twins Nan and Bert were eight years old dark and handsome and as like as two peas the neighbors used to say
Some people thought it strange there should be two pairs of twins in one house but Nan said it was just like fourleaf clovers that always grow in little patches by themselves
This morning the letter from Aunt Sarah always a welcome happening was especially joyous
Do read it out loud pleaded Flossie when the blue envelope had been opened in the sewing room by Mrs Bobbsey
When can we go
broke in Freddie at a single hint that the missive contained an invitation to visit Meadow Brook the home of Aunt Sarah in the country
Now be patient children the mother told them
Ill read the invitation in just a minute and she kept her eyes fastened on the blue paper in a way that even to Freddie and Flossie meant something very interesting
Aunt Sarah wants to know first how we all are
Oh were all well Freddie interrupted showing some impatience
Do listen Freddie or we wont hear Flossie begged him tugging at his elbow
Then she says continued the mother that this is a beautiful summer at Meadow Brook
Course it is
We know that
broke in Freddie again
Freddie
pleaded Flossie
And she asks how we would like to visit them this summer
Fine like it  lovely
the little boy almost shouted losing track of words in his delight
Tell her well come mamma went on Freddie
Do send a letter quick wont you mamma 
Freddie Bobbsey
spoke up Flossie in a little girls way of showing indignation
If you would only keep quiet we could hear about going but  you always stop mamma
Please mamma read the rest and the golden head was pressed against the mothers shoulder from the arm of the big rocking chair
Well I was only just saying   pouted Freddie
Now listen dear
The mother went on once more reading from the letter Aunt Sarah says Cousin Harry can hardly wait until vacation time to see Bert and she also says For myself I cannot wait to see the babies
I want to hear Freddie laugh and I want to hear Flossie say her piece as she did last Christmas then I just want to hug them both to death and so does their Uncle Daniel
 Good
 goody
broke in the irrepressible Freddie again
Ill just hug Aunt Sarah this way and he fell on his mothers neck and squeezed until she cried for him to stop
I guess shell like that Freddie wound up in real satisfaction at his hugging ability
Not if you spoil her hair Flossie insisted while the overcome mother tried to adjust herself generally
Is that all
Flossie asked
No there is a message for Bert and Nan too but I must keep that for lunch time
Nobody likes stale news the mother replied
But cant we hear it when Bert and Nan come from school
coaxed Flossie
Of course the mother assured her
But you must run out in the air now
We have taken such a long time to read the letter
Oh arent you glad
exclaimed Flossie to her brother as they ran along the stone wall that edged the pretty terrace in front of their home
Glad
Im just  so glad  so glad  I could almost fly up in the air
the boy managed to say in chunks for he had never had much experience with words a very few answering for all his needs
The morning passed quickly to the little ones for they had so much to think about now and when the school children appeared around the corner Flossie and Freddie hurried to meet Nan and Bert to tell them the news
Were going
were going
was about all Freddie could say
0h the letter came  from Aunt Sarah
was Flossies way of telling the news
But it was at the lunch table that Mrs Bobbsey finished the letter
Tell Nan she read that Aunt Sarah has a lot of new patches and tidies to show her and tell her I have found a new kind of jumble chocolate that I am going to teach her to make
There daughter you see commented Mrs Bobbsey Aunt Sarah has not forgotten what a good little baker you are
Chocolate jumble remarked Bert and smacked his lips
Say Nan be sure to learn that
It sounds good the brother declared
Just then Dinah the maid brought in the chocolate and the children tried to tell her about going to the country but so many were talking at once that the goodnatured colored girl interrupted the confusion with a hearty laugh
Ha
ha
ha
And all youuns be goin to de country
Yes Dinah Mrs Bobbsey told her and just listen to what Aunt Sarah says about you and once more the blue letter came out while Mrs Bobbsey read  And be sure to bring dear old Dinah
We have plenty of room and she will so enjoy seeing the farming
Farming
Ha
ha
Dat I do like
Used to farm all time home in Virginie
the maid declared
And I likes it fussrate
Yes Dinahll go and hoe de corn and aside to Bert steal de watermelons
The prospects were indeed bright for a happy time in the country and the Bobbseys never disappointed themselves when fun was within their reach
CHAPTER II THE START With so much to think about the few weeks that were left between vacation and the country passed quickly for the Bobbseys
As told in any first book The Bobbsey Twins this little family had a splendid home in Lakeport where Mr Bobbsey was a lumber mechant sic
The mother and father were both young themselves and always took part in their childrens joys and sorrows for there were sorrows sometimes
Think of poor little Freddie getting shut up all alone in a big store with only a little black kitten Snoop to keep him from being scared to death that was told of in the first book for Freddie went shopping one day with his mamma and wandered off a little bit
Presently he found himself in the basement of the store there he had so much trouble in getting out he fell asleep in the meantime
Then when he awoke and it was all dark and the great big janitor came to rescue him  oh
 Freddie thought the man might even be a giant when he first heard the janitors voice in the dark store Freddie often got in trouble but like most good little boys he was always saved just at the right time for they say good children have real angels watching over them
Nan Bert and Flossie all had plenty of exciting experiences too as told in The Bobbsey Twins for among other neighbors there was Danny Rugg a boy who always tried to make trouble for Bert and sometimes almost succeeded in getting Bert into hot water as Dinah expressed it
Of course Nan had her friends as all big girls have but Bert her twin brother was her dearest chum just as Freddie was Flossies
When we get to the country we will plant trees go fishing and pick blackberries Nan said one day
Yes and Im going with Harry out exploring Bert announced
Im just going to plant things prim little Flossie lisped
I just love melons and ice cream and   Ice cream
Can you really plant ice cream
Freddie asked innocently which made the others all laugh at Flossies funny plans
Im going to have chickens Freddie told them
Im going to have one of those queer chicken coops that you shut up tight and when you open it its just full of little kippies
 Oh an incubator you mean Nan explained
Thats a machine for raising chickens without any mother
But mine are going to have a mother Freddie corrected thinking how sad little chickens would be without a kind mamma like his own
But how can they have a mother where there isnt any for them
Flossie asked with a girls queer way of reasoning
Ill get them one Freddie protested
Ill let Snoop be their mamma
A cat
the idea
why he would eat em all up Flossie argued
Not if I whipped him once for doing it the brother insisted
Then Nan and Bert began to tease him for whipping the kitten after the chickens had been all eaten up
So the merry days went on until at last vacation came
Just one more night Nan told Flossie and Freddie when she prepared them for bed to help her very busy mother
Bert assisted his father with the packing up for the taking of a whole family to the country meant lots of clothes besides some books and just a few toys
Then there was Berts tool box  he knew he would need that at Meadow Brook
The morning came at last a beautiful bright day a rare one for traveling for a fine shower the evening before had washed and cooled things off splendidly
Now come children Mr Bobbsey told the excited youngsters
Keep track of your things
Sam will be ready in a few minutes and then we must be off
Promptly Sam pulled up to the door with the family carriage and all hurried to get in
Oh Snoop Snoop
cried Freddie
Hes in the library in the box
Dinah get him quick get him
and Dinah ran back after the little kitten
Here you is Freddie
she gasped out of breath from hurrying
You dont go and forget poor Snoopy
and she climbed in beside Sam
Then they started
Oh my lan amassy
yelled Dinah presently in distress
Sam Johnson you jest turn dat hoss around quick and she jerked at the reins herself
You heah Sam
Quick I tells you
Get back to dat house
Ise forgot to bring  to bring my lunch basket
Oh never mind Dinah Mrs Bobbsey interrupted
We will have lunch on the train
But I couldnt leab dat nice lunch I got ready fo de chillen in between missus the colored woman urged
Ill get it quick as a wink
Now Sam you rush in dar quick and fetch dat red and white basket dat smells like chicken
So the goodnatured maid had her way much to the delight of Bert and Freddie who liked nothing so well as one of Dinahs homemade lunches
The railroad station was reached without mishap and while Mr Bobbsey attended to getting the baskets checked at the little window in the big round office the children sat about exploring
Freddie hung back a little when a locomotive steamed up
He clung to his mothers skirt yet wanted to see how the machine worked
Thats the fireman Bert told him pointing to the man in the cab of the engine
Fireman
Freddie repeated
Not like our firemen
I wouldnt be that kind He had always wanted to be a fireman who helps to put out fires
Oh this is another kind his father explained just then coming up in readiness for the start
I guess Snoops afraid Freddie whispered to his mother while he peeped into the little box where Snoop was peacefully purring
Glad of the excuse to get a little further away Freddie ran back to where Dinah sat on a long shiny bench
Say chile she began you hear dat music ober dar
Well a big fat lady jest jumped up and down on dat machine and it starts up and plays Swanee Ribber
Thats a weighing machine Nan said with a laugh
You just put a penny in it and it tells you how much you weigh besides playing a tune
Lan o massy
does it
Wonder has I time to try it
Yes come on called Bert
Father said we have plenty of time and at the word Dinah set out to get weighed
She looked a little scared as if it might go off first but when she heard the soft strain of an old melody coming out she almost wanted to dance
Now aint dat fine
she exclaimed
Wouldnt dat be splendid in de kitchen to weigh de flour Freddie 
But even the interesting sights in the railroad station had to be given up now for the porter swung open a big gate and called All aboard for Meadow Brook
and the Bobbseys hurried off
CHAPTER III SNOOP ON THE TRAIN Im glad Dinah looks nice Flossie whispered to her mother when she saw how beautiful the parlor car was
And isnt Freddie good
the little girl remarked anxiously as if fearing her brother might forget his best manners in such a grand place
Freddie and Bert sat near their father on the big soft revolving chairs in the Pullman car while Nan and Flossie occupied the sofa at the end near their mother
Dinah sat up straight and dignified and as Flossie said really looked nice in her very clean white waist and her soft black skirt
On her carefully parted hair she wore a neat little black turban
Bert always laughed at the number of parts Dinah made in her kinky hair and declared that she ought to be a civil engineer she could draw such splendid maps even on the back of her head
The grandeur of the parlor car almost overcame Freddie but he clung to Snoop in the pasteboard box and positively refused to let the kitten go into the baggage car
Dinahs lunch basket was so neatly done up the porter carried it very carefully to her seat when she entered the train although lunch baskets are not often taken in as Pullman car baggage
Im going to let Snoop out
whispered Freddie suddenly and before anyone had a chance to stop him the little black kitten jumped out of the box and perched himself on the window sill to look out at the fine scenery
Oh
exclaimed Mrs Bobbsey the porter will put him off the train
and she tried to catch the now happy little Snoop
No he wont Mr Bobbsey assured her
I will watch out for that
Here Snoop coaxed Nan also alarmed
Come Snoop
But the kitten had been captive long enough to appreciate his liberty now and so refused to be coaxed
Flossie came down between the velvet chairs very cautiously but as soon as Snoop saw her arm stretch out for him he just walked over the back of the highest seat and down into the lap of a sleeping lady
Oh mercy me
screamed the lady as she awoke with Snoops tail whisking over her face
Goodness gracious
what is that
and before she had fully recovered from the shock she actually jumped up on the chair like the funny pictures of a woman and a mouse
The people around could not help laughing but Freddie and the other Bobbseys were frightened
Oh will they kill Snoop now
Freddie almost cried
Dinah please help me get him
By this time the much scared lady had found out it was only a little kitten and feeling very foolish she sat down and coaxed Snoop into her lap again
Mr Bobbsey hurried to apologize
Well have to put him back in the box Mr Bobbsey declared but that was easier said than done for no sooner would one of the Bobbseys approach the cat than Snoop would walk himself off
And not on the floor either but up and down the velvet chairs and in and out under the passengers arms
Strange to say not one of the people minded it but all petted Snoop until as Bert said He owned the car
Dat cat am de worst
Dinah exclaimed
Pears like it was so stuck up an fine dar aint no place in dis yere Pullin car good nough fer him
Oh the porter
the porter
Bert cried
Hell surely throw Snoop out of the window
Snoop
Snoop
the whole family called in chorus but Snoop saw the porter himself and made up his mind the right thing to do under the circumstances would be to make friends
Cat
exclaimed the goodlooking colored man
Scat
Well I declare
What you think of that
Freddie felt as if he were going to die he was so scared and Flossies tears ran down her cheeks
Will he eat him
Freddie blubbered thinking of some queer stories he had heard like that
Mr Bobbsey too was a little alarmed and hurried to reach Snoop
The porter stooped to catch the offending kitten while Snoop walked right up to him sniffed his uniform and stepped upon the out stretched black hand
Well you is a nice little kitten the porter admitted fondling Snoop in spite of orders
Oh please Mr Porter give me my cat
cried Freddie breaking away from all restraint and reaching Snoop
Yours is it
Well I dont blame you boy for bringing dat cat along
An say and the porter leaned down to the frightened Freddie its against orders but Id jest like to take dis yer kitten back in de kitchen and treat him for hes  hes a star
and he fondled Snoop closer
But I didnt know it was wrong and Ill put him right back in the box Freddie whimpered not quite understanding the porters intention
Well say son
the porter exclaimed as Mr Bobbsey came up
What do you say if you papa let you come back in de kitchen wid me
Den you can jest see how I treat de kittycat
So Freddie started off after the porter who proudly carried Snoop while Mr Bobbsey brought up the rear
Everybody along the aisle wanted to pet Snoop who from being a little stowaway was now the hero of the occasion
More than once Freddie stumbled against the side of the big seats as the cars swung along like a reckless automobile but each time his father caught him by the blouse and set him on his feet again until at last after passing through the big dining car the kitchen was reached
What you got dar
Somethin fer soup
laughed the goodnatured cook who was really fond of cats and wouldnt harm one for the world
Soon the situation was explained and as the porters and others gathered around in admiration Snoop drank soup like a gentleman and then took two courses one of fish and one of meat in splendid traveler fashion
Dats de way to drink soup on a fast train laughed the porter
You makes sure of it dat way and saves your clothes
Ha
ha
ha
he laughed remembering how many men have to have their good clothes cleaned of soup after a dinner on a fast train
Reluctantly the men gave Snoop back to Freddie who this time to make sure of no further adventures put the popular black kitten in his box in spite of protests from the admiring passengers
You have missed so much of the beautiful scenery Nan told Freddie and her father when they joined the party again
Just see those mountains over there and then they sat at the broad windows gazing for a long time at the grand scenery as it seemed to rush by
CHAPTER IV A LONG RIDE The train was speeding along with that regular motion that puts many travelers to sleep when Freddie curled himself on the sofa and went to sleep
Poor little chap
Mr Bobbsey remarked
He is tired out and he was so worried about Snoop
Im glad we were able to get this sofa so many other people like a rest and there are only four sofas on each car Mrs Bobbsey explained to Dinah who was now tucking Freddie in as if he were at home in his own cozy bed
The air cushion was blown up and put under the yellow head and a shawl was carefully placed over him
Flossies pretty dimpled face was pressed close to the window pane admiring the big world that seemed to be running away from the train and Bert found the observation end of the train very interesting
What a beautiful grove of white birch trees
Nan exclaimed as the train swung into a ravine
And see the soft ferns clinging about them
Mother the ferns around the birch tree make me think of the fine lace about your throat
Why daughter you seem to be quite poetical
and the mother smiled for indeed Nan had a very promising mind
What time will we get there papa
Bert asked returning from the vestibule
In time for dinner Aunt Sarah said that is if they keep dinner for us until one oclock answered the parent as he consulted his watch
It seems as if we had been on the train all night Flossie remarked
Well we started early dear the mother assured the tired little girl
Perhaps you would like one of Dinahs dainty sandwiches now
A light lunch was quickly decided on and Dinah took Flossie and Nan to a little private room at one end of the train Bert went with his father to the smoking room on the other end while the mother remained to watch Freddie
The lunch was put up so that each small sandwich could be eaten without a crumb spilling as the little squares were each wrapped separately in waxed paper
There was a queer alcohol lamp in the ladies room and other handy contrivances for travelers which amused Flossie and Nan
Dats to heat milk fo babies Dinah told the girls as she put the paper napkins carefully on their laps and got each a nice drink of icewater out of the cooler
Meanwhile Bert was enjoying his lunch at the other end of the car for children always get hungry when traveling and meals on the train are only served at certain hours
Two other little girls came into the compartment while Flossie and Nan were at lunch
The strange girls wore gingham aprons over their fine white dresses to keep the car dust off their clothes and they had paper caps on their heads like the favors worn at childrens parties
Seeing there was no stool vacant the strangers darted out again in rather a rude way Nan thought
Take you time honeys Dinah told her charges
If dey is very hungry dey can get ice cream outside
But mother never lets us eat strange ice cream Flossie reminded the maid
And maybe they cant either
Soon the lunch was finished and the Bobbseys felt much refreshed by it
Freddie still slept with Snoops box close beside him and Mrs Bobbsey was reading a magazine
One hour more
Bert announced beginning to pick things up even that early
Now we better all close our eyes and rest so that we will feel good when we get to Meadow Brook Mrs Bobbsey told them
It was no task to obey this suggestion and the next thing the children knew mother and father and Dinah were waking them up to get them ready to leave the train
Now dont forget anything Mr Bobbsey cautioned the party as hats and wraps were donned and parcels picked up
Freddie was still very sleepy and his papa had to carry him off while the others with some excitement hurried after
Oh Snoop Snoop
cried Freddie as having reached the platform they now saw the train start off
I forgot Snoop
Get him quick
Dat kitten again
Dinah exclaimed with some indignation
Hes more trouble den  den de whole family
In an instant the train had gotten up speed and it seemed Snoop was gone this time sure
Snoop
cried Freddie in dismay
Just then the kind porter who had befriended the cat before appeared on the platform with the perforated box in his hand
I wanted to keep him stammered the porter but I knows de little boy ud break his heart after him
And he threw the box to Mr Bobbsey
There was no time for words but Mr Bobbsey thrust a coin in the mans hand and all the members of the Bobbsey family looked their thanks
Well I declare you cant see anybody called out a goodnatured little lady trying to surround them all at once
Aunt Sarah
exclaimed the Bobbseys
And Uncle Dan
And Harry
Hello
How do
How are you
How be you
and such kissing and handshaking had not for some time entertained the old agent at the Meadow Brook station
Here at last
Uncle Daniel declared grabbing up Freddie and giving him the kind of hug Freddie had intended giving Aunt Sarah
The big wagon from the Bobbsey farm with the seats running along each side stood at the other side of the platform and into this the Bobbseys were gathered bag and baggage not forgetting the little black cat
All aboard for Meadow Brook farm
called Bert as the wagon started aff sic along the shady country road
CHAPTER V MEADOW BROOK Oh how cool the trees are out here
Flossie exclaimed as the wagon rumbled along so close to the low trees that Bert could reach out and pick horsechestnut blossoms
My how sweet it is
said Dinah as she sniffed audibly enjoying the freshness of the country
Freddie was on the seat with Uncle Dan and had Snoops box safe in his arms
He wanted to let the cat see along the road but everybody protested
No more Snoop in this trip laughed Mr Bobbsey
He has had all the fun he needs for today
So Freddie had to be content
Oh do let me get out
pleaded Nan presently
See that field of orange lilies
Not now dear Aunt Sarah told her
Dinner is spoiling for us and we can often walk down here to get flowers
Oh the cute little calf
Look
Bert exclaimed from his seat next to Harry who had been telling his cousin of all the plans he had made for a jolly vacation
Look at the billygoat
called Freddie
See see that big black chicken flying
Flossie cried out excitedly
Thats a hawk
laughed Bert maybe its a chicken hawk
A children hawk
Flossie exclaimed missing the word
Then everybody laughed and Flossie said maybe there were children hawks for bad girls and boys anyway
Aunt Sarah and Mrs Bobbsey were chatting away like two schoolgirls while Dinah and the children saw something new and interesting at every few paces old Billy the horse took
Hello there neighbor called a voice from the field at the side of the road
My horse has fallen in the ditch and Ill have to trouble you to help me
Certainly certainly Peter answered Uncle Daniel promptly jumping down with Mr Bobbsey Bert and Harry following
Aunt Sarah leaned over the seat and took the reins but when she saw in what ditch the other horse had fallen she pulled Billy into the gutter
Poor Peter
she exclaimed
Thats the second horse that fell in that ditch this week
And its an awful job to get them out
Ill just wait to see if they need our Billy and if not we can drive on home for Martha will be most crazy waiting with dinner
Uncle Daniel Mr Bobbsey and the boys hurried to where Peter Burns stood at the brink of one of those ditches that look like mud and turn out to be water
And that horse is a boarder too
Peter told them
Last night we said he looked awful sad but we didnt think he would commit suicide
Got plenty of blankets
Uncle Daniel asked pulling his coat off and preparing to help his neighbor as all good people do in the country
Four of them and these planks
But I couldnt get a man around
Lucky you happened by Peter Burns answered
All this time the horse in the ditch moaned as if in pain but Peter said it was only because he couldnt get on his feet
Harry being light in weight slipped a halter over the poor beasts head
I could get a strap around him
Harry suggested moving out cautiously on the plank
All right my lad go ahead Peter told him passing the big strap over to Bert who in turn passed it on to Harry
It was no easy matter to get the strap in place but with much tugging and splashing of mud Harry succeeded
Then the ropes were attached and everybody pulled vigorously
Get up Ginger
Get up Ginger
Peter called lustily but Ginger only seemed to flop in deeper through his efforts to raise himself
Guess well have to get Billy to pull Uncle Daniel suggested and Mr Bobbsey hurried back to the road to unhitch the other horse
Dont let Billy fall in
exclaimed Nan who was much excited over the accident
Cant I go papa
Freddie pleaded
Ill stay away from the edge
You better stay in the wagon the horse might cut up when he gets out the father warned Freddie who reluctantly gave in
Soon Billy was hitched to the ropes and with a few kind words from Uncle Daniel the big white horse strained forward pulling Ginger to his feet as he did so
Hurrah
shouted Freddie from the wagon
Billy is a circus horse isnt he Uncle Dan
Hes a good boy the uncle called back patting Billy affectionately while Mr Bobbsey and the boys loosened the straps
The other horse lay on the blankets and Peter rubbed him with all his might to save a chill as he told the boys
Then after receiving many thanks for the help given the Bobbseys once more started off toward the farm
Hot work Uncle Daniel remarked to the ladies as he mopped his forehead
Im so glad you could help Peter Aunt Sarah told him for he does seem to have SO much trouble
All kinds of things happen in the country Harry remarked as Billy headed off for home
At each house along the way boys would call out to Harry asking him about going fishing
or berrying or some other sport so that Bert felt a good time was in store for him as the boys were about his own age and seemed so agreeable
Nice fellows Harry remarked by way of introducing Bert
They seem so Bert replied cordially
Weve made up a lot of sports Harry went on and we were only waiting for you to come to start out
Weve planned a picnic for tomorrow
Here we are called Uncle Daniel as Biily turned into the pretty driveway in front of the Bobbseys country home
On each side of the drive grew straight lines of boxwood and back of this hedge were beautiful flowers shining out grandly now in the July sun
Hello Martha
called the visitors as the faithful old servant appeared on the broad white veranda
She was not black like Dinah but looked as if she was just as merry and full of fun as anyone could be
Got here at last
she exclaimed taking Dinahs lunch basket
Glad to see you Martha Dinah told her
You see I had to come along
And Snoop too our kitty
We fetched him
The more the merrier replied the other and theres lots of room for all
Starved to death
Harry laughed as the odor of a fine dinner reached him
Well wash up a bit and join you in a few minutes ladies Uncle Daniel said in his polite way
The horse accident had given plenty of need for a washing up
Got Snoop dis time Freddie lisped knocking the cover off the box and petting the frightened little black cat
Hungry Snoopy
he asked pressing his baby cheek to the soft fur
Bring the poor kitty out to the kitchen Martha told him
Ill get him a nice saucer of fresh milk
And so it happened as usual Snoop had his meal first just as he had had on the Pullman car
Soon after this Martha went outside and rang a big dinner bell that all the men and boys could hear
And then the first vacation dinner was served in the long old fashioned dining room
CHAPTER VI FRISKY Although they were tired from their journey the children had no idea of resting on that beautiful afternoon so promptly after dinner the baggage was opened and vacation clothes were put on
Bert of course was ready first and soon he and Harry were running down the road to meet the other boys and perfect their plans for the picnic
Nan began her pleasures by exploring the flower gardens with Uncle Daniel
I pride myself on those zinnias the uncle told Nan just see those yellows and those pinks
Some are as big as dahlias arent they
They are just beautiful uncle Nan replied in real admiration
I have always loved zinnias
And they last so long
All summer
Then what do you think of my sweet peas
So they went from one flower bed to another and Nan thought she had never before seen so many pretty plants together
Flossie and Freddie were out in the barnyard with Aunt Sarah
Oh auntie what queer little chickens
Flossie exclaimed pointing to a lot of pigeons that were eagerly eating corn with the chickens
Those are Harrys homer pigeons the aunt explained
Some day we must go off to the woods and let the birds fly home with a letter to Dinah and Martha
Oh please do it now Freddie urged always in a hurry for things
We couldnt today dear Aunt Sarah told him
Come let me show you our new little calf
Let me ride her
Freddie asked as they reached the animal
Calfs arent for riding theyre for milk Flossie spoke up
Yes this one drinks plenty of milk Aunt Sarah said while Frisky the calf rubbed her head kindly against Aunt Sarahs skirts
Then let me take her for a walk Freddie pleaded much in love with the pretty creature
And they dont walk either Flossie persisted
They mostly run
I could just hold the rope couldnt I Aunt Sarah
If you keep away from the barnyard gate and hold her very tight was the consent given finally much to Freddies delight
Nice Frisky he told the calf petting her fondly
Pretty calf will you let Snoop play with you
Frisky was sniffing suspiciously all the time and Aunt Sarah had taken Flossie in the barn to see the chickens nests
Come Frisky take a walk suggested Freddie and quite obediently the little cow walked along
But suddenly Frisky spied the open gate and the lovely green grass outside
Without a moments warning the calf threw her hind legs up in the air then bolted straight for the gate dragging Freddie along after her
Whoa Frisky
whoa
yelled Freddie but the calf ran right along
Hold tight Freddie
called Flossie as she and Aunt Sarah appeared on the scene
Whoa whoa
yelled the little boy constantly but he might as well have called Get app for Frisky was going so fast now that poor little Freddies hands were all but bleeding from the rough rope
Look out Freddie
Let go
called Aunt I Sarah as she saw Frisky heading for the apple tree
The next minute Frisky made a dash around the tree once then again winding the rope as she went and throwing Freddie out with force against the side of the terrace
Oh Freddie moaned feebly
Are you dead
cried Flossie running up with tears in her eyes
Oh moaned the boy again turning over with much trouble as Aunt Sarah lifted him
Oh he murmured once more oh  catch  Frisky
Never mind her Aunt Sarah said anxiously
Are you hurt dear
No  not  a bit
But look
There goes Frisky
Catch her
Your poor little hands
Flossie almost cried kissing the red blisters
See theyre cut
Firemen have to slide on ropes
Freddie spoke up recovering himself and Im going to be a fireman
I was one that time because I tried to save somebody and didnt care if I got hurted
You are a brave little boy Aunt Sarah assured him
You just sit here with sister while I try to get that naughty Frisky before she spoils the garden
By this time the calf was almost lost to them as she plunged in and out of the pretty hedges
Fortunately Bert and Harry just turned in the gate
Runaway calf
Runaway calf
called the boys
Stop the runaway
and instantly a halfdozen other boys appeared and all started in pursuit
But Frisky knew how to run besides she had the advantage of a good start and now she just dashed along as if the affair was the biggest joke of her life
The river
The river
called the boys Shell jump in
and indeed the pretty Meadow Brook or river that ran along some feet lower than the Bobbseys house on the other side of the highway was now dangerously near the runaway calf
There was a heavy thicket a few feet further up and as the boys squeezed in and out of the bushes Frisky plunged into this piece of wood
Oh shes gone now sure
called Harry Listen
Sure enough there was a splash
Frisky must be in the river
It took some time to reach the spot where the fall might have sounded from and the boys made their way heavyhearted for all loved the pretty little Frisky
Theres footprints
Bert discovered emerging from the thick bush
And they end here
Harry finished indicating the very brink of the river
Shes gone
But how could she drown so quickly
Bert asked
Guess thats the channel Tom Mason one of the neighbors boys answered
Listen
Thought I heard something in the bushes
Bert whispered
But no welcome sound came to tell that poor Frisky was hiding in the brushwood
With heavy hearts the boys turned away
They didnt even feel like talking somehow
They had counted on bringing the calf back in triumph
When Flossie and Freddie saw them coming back without Frisky they just had to cry and no one could stop them
I tried to be a fireman
blubbered Freddie
I didnt care if the rope hurted my hands either
If only I didnt go in to see the chickens nests Flossie whimpered I could have helped Freddie
Never you mind little uns Dinah told them
Dinah go and fetch dat Frisky back tomorrer
See if she dont
You jest dont cry no more but eat you supper and take a good sleep cause were goin to have a picnic tomorrer you knows doesnt youse
The others tried to comfort the little ones too and Uncle Daniel said he knew where he could buy another calf just like Frisky so after a little while Freddie felt better and even laughed when Martha made the white cat Fluffy and Snoop play ball in the big long kitchen
Im goin to pray Frisky will come back Nan told her little brother when she kissed him goodnight and maybe the dear Lord will find her for you
Oh yes Nannie do ask Him pleaded Freddie and tell Him  tell Him if Hell do it this time Ill be so good I wont never need to bother Him any more
Freddie meant very well but it sounded strange and made Aunt Sarah say The Lord bless the little darling
Then night came and an eventful day closed in on our dear little Bobbseys
Seems as if something else ought to happen tonight Bert remarked to Harry as they prepared to retire
This was such a full day wasnt it
Its early yet Harry answered and its never late here until its time to get early again
Sounds so strange to hear  those  those  Crickets Harry told him and tree toads and katydids
Oh theres lots to listen to if you shouldnt feel sleepy
The house was now all quiet and even the boys had ceased whispering
Suddenly there was a noise in the driveway
The next minute someone called out in the night
Hello there
All asleep
Wake up somebody
Even Freddie did wake up and ran into his mothers room
Come down here Mr Bobbsey the voice continued
Oh is that you Peter
Ill be down directly called back Uncle Daniel who very soon after appeared on the front porch
Well I declare
Uncle Daniel exclaimed loud enough for all the listeners at the windows to hear
So youve got her
Well Im very glad indeed
Especially on the boys account
Yes spoke out Peter Burns I went in the barn a while ago with the lantern and there wasnt your calf asleep with mine as cozy as could be
I brought her over tonight for fear you might miss her and get to lookin otherwise I wouldnt have disturbed you
By this time the man from the barn was up and out too and he took Frisky back to her own bed but not until the little calf had been taken far out on the front lawn so that Freddie could see her from the window to make sure
The Lord did bring her back Freddie told his mamma as she kissed him goodnight again and put him in his bed happier this time than before
And I promised to be awful good to pay Him for His trouble the sleepy boy murmured
Flossie had been asleep about two hours when she suddenly called to her mother
What is it my dear
asked Mrs Bobbsey
Somebody is playing the piano answered the little girl
Who is it
Nobody is playing
You must be dreaming answered the mother and smiled to herself
No I am sure I heard the piano insisted Flossie
Mother and daughter listened but could hear nothing
You were surely dreaming said MrsBobbsey
Come I will tuck you in again and she did so
But was Flossie dreaming
Let us wait and see
CHAPTER VII A COUNTRY PICNIC When morning came everyone was astir early for not only was a happy day promised but there was Frisky the runaway to be looked over
Mr Richard Bobbsey Freddies father left on an early train for Lakeport and would not come back to Meadow Brook until Saturday afternoon
Let me go out and see Frisky Freddie insisted even before his breakfast had been served
I want to be sure its her
Yes thats her Freddie admitted cause theres the rope that cut my hands when i was a real fireman
But Frisky didnt seem to care a bit about ropes or firemen but just chewed and chewed like all cows do as if there was nothing in this world to do but eat
Come on sonny called Dinah
You can help me pick de radishes fo breakfast and presently our little boy with the kindhearted maid was up in the garden looking for the best radishes of the early crop
See Freddie said Dinah
De red ones show above de ground
And we must only pull de ones wid de big leaves cause deyre ripe
Freddie bent down so close to find the radishes that a disturbed toad hopped right up at his nose
Oh
he cried frightened
Dinah was that  a  a  a snake
Snake chile lan sakes alive
Dat was a poor little toady  more scare den you was and she pointed to the big dock leaf under which the hoptoad was now hiding
Lets pick beans Freddie suggested liking the garden work
Not beans fer breakfast laughed Dinah
That stuff there then the boy persisted pointing to the soft green leaves of early lettuce
Well I dunno
Martha didnt say so but it sure does look pretty
Yes I guess we kin pick some fo salad and so Dinah showed Freddie how to cut the lettuce heads off and leave the stalks to grow again
Out early laughed Uncle Daniel seeing the youngest member of the family coming down the garden path with the small basket of vegetables
Is it
Freddie asked meaning early of course in his queer way of saying things without words
See
see
called Nan and Flossie running down the cross path back of the cornfield
Such big ones
Nan exclaimed referring to the luscious red strawberries in the white dish she held
Look at mine insisted Flossie
Arent they bigger
Fine
ejaculated Dinah
But my redishes are are  redder argued Freddie who was not to be outdone by his sisters
Ours are sweeter laughed Nan trying to tease her little brother
Ours are  ours are   Hotter put in Dinah which ended the argument
Bert and Harry had also been out gathering for breakfast and returned now with a basket of lovely fresh watercress
We cant eat em all Martha told the boys But theyll go good in the picnic lunch
What a pretty breakfast table it was
Such berries such lettuce such watercress and the radishes
Too bad papa had to go so early Bert remarked
He just loves green stuff
So does Frisky put in Freddie and he wondered why everyone laughed
After breakfast the lunch baskets were put up and while Bert and Harry Nan and Aunt Sarah went to invite the neighboring children Flossie and Freddie were just busy jumping around the kitchen where Dinah and Martha were making them laugh merrily with funny little stories
Snoop and Fluffy had become good friends and now lay close together on the kitchen hearth
Dinah said they were just like two babies only not so much trouble
Put peaches in my basket Dinah Freddie ordered
And strawberries in mine added Flossie
Now youuns jest wait
Dinah told them and when you gets out in de woods if you hasnt nough to eat you kin jest climb a tree an cut down   Wood
put in Freddie innocently while Martha said that was about all that could be found in the woods in July
The boys had come in from inviting the other fellers when Uncle Daniel proposed a feature for the picnic
How would you like to take two homer pigeons along
he asked them
You can send a note back to Martha to say what time you will be home
Jolly
chorused the boys all instantly making a run for the pigeon house
Wait
Harry told the visitors
We must be careful not to scare them
Then he went inside the wire cage with a handful of corn
See  de  coon see  de  coon
called the boys softly imitating the queer sounds made by the doves cooing
Harry tossed the corn inside the cage and as the light and dark homers he wanted tasted the food Harry lowered the little door and took the birds safely in his arms
Now Bert you can get the quills he told his cousin
Go into the chicken yard and look for two long goose feathers
Tom Mason you can go in the kitchen and ask Dinah for a piece of tissue paper and a spool of silk thread
Each boy started off to fulfill his commission not knowing exactly what for until all came together in the barnyard again
Now Bert went on Harry write very carefully on the slip of paper the message for Martha
Have you a soft pencil
Bert found that he had one and so following his cousins dictation he wrote on one slip Have dinner ready at five
And on the other he wrote John come for us at four
Now continued Harry roll the slips up fine enough to go in the goose quills
This was done with much difficulty as the quills were very narrow but the task was finally finished
All ready now concluded Harry to put the letters in the box and very gently he tied with the silken thread one quill under the wing of each pigeon
Only one feather was used to tie the thread to and the light quill the thin paper and the soft silk made a parcel so very small and light in weight that the pigeons were no way inconvenienced by the messages
Now well put them in this basket and theyre ready for the picnic Harry announced to his much interested companions
Then all started for the house with Harry and the basket in the lead
John the stableman was at the door now with the big hay wagon which had been chosen as the best thing to take the jolly party in
There was nice fresh hay in the bottom and seats at the sides for the grown folks while the little ones nestled in the sweetsmelling hay like live birds
Its like a kindergarten party laughed Nan as the birds nests reminded her of one of the mother plays
No taint
Freddie corrected for he really was not fond of the kindergarten
Its just like a picnic he finished
Besides the Bobbseys there were Tom Mason Jack Hopkins and August Stout friends of Harry
Then there were Mildred Manners and Mabel Herold who went as Nans guests little Roy Mason was Freddies company and Bessie Dimple went with Flossie
The little pigeons kept cooing every now and then but made no attempt to escape from Harrys basket
It was a beautiful day and the long ride through the country was indeed a merry one
Along the way people called out pleasantly from farmhouses for everybody in Meadow Brook knew the Bobbseys
Thats their cousins from the city little boys and girls along the way would say
Havent they pretty clothes
the girls were sure to add
Lets stop for a drink at the spring suggested August Stout who was stout by name and nature and always loved a good drink of water
The children tumbled out of the wagon safely and were soon waiting turns at the spring
There was a round basin built of stones and quite deep
Into this the clear sprinkling water dropped from a little cave in the hill above
On top of the cave a large flat stone was placed
This kept the little waterfall clean and free trom the falling leaves
Oh what a cute little pond
Freddie exclaimed for he had never seen a real spring before
Thats a spring Flossie informed him although that was all she knew about it
The big boys were not long dipping their faces in and getting a drink of the cool clear water but the girls had to take their hats off roll up their sleeves and go through a regular performance as Harry said before they could make up their minds to dip into the water
Mabel brought up her supply with her hands but when Nan tried it her hands leaked and the result was her fresh white frock got wet
Flossies curls tumbled in both sides and when she had finished she looked as if she had taken a plunge at the seashore
Let me
Let me
cried Freddie impatiently and without further warning he thrust his yellow head in the spring clear up to his neck
Oh Freddie
yelled Nan grabbing him by the heels and thus saving a more serious accident
Oh
oh
oh
spluttered Freddie nearly choked Im drowned
and the water really seemed to be running out of his eyes noses and ears all at once
Oh Freddie
was all Mrs Bobbsey could say as a shower of clean handkerchiefs was sent from the hay wagon to dry the drowned boy
Just like the flour barrel
laughed Bert referring to the funny accident that befell Freddie the winter before as told in my other book The Bobbsey Twins
Only that was a dry bath and this a wet one Nan remarked as Freddies curls were shook out in the sun
Did you get a drink
asked August whose invitation to drink had caused the mishap
Yep
answered Freddie bravely and I was a real fireman too that time cause they always get soaked dont they Bert
Being assured they did the party once more started off for the woods
It was getting to be all woods now only a driveway breaking through the pines maples and chestnut trees that abounded in that section
Just turn in there John
Harry directed as a particularly thick group of trees appeared
Here were chosen the picnic grounds and all the things taken from the wagon and before John was out of sight on the return home the children had established their camp and were flying about the woods like little fairies
Lets build a furnace Jack Hopkins suggested
Lets said all the boys who immediately set out carrying stones and piling them up to build the stove
There was plenty of wood about and when the fire was built the raw potatoes that Harry had secretly brought along were roasted finer than any oven could cook them
Mrs Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah had spread the tablecloth on the grass and were now busy opening the baskets and arranging the places
There were so many pretty little nooks to explore in the woods that Mrs Bobbsey had to warn the children not to get too far away Are there giants
Freddie asked
No but there are very dark lonely places the woods and little boys might find snakes
And bears
put in Freddie to which remark his mother said perhaps because there really might be bears in a woods so close to the mountains
CHAPTER VIII FUN IN THE WOODS Dinner served in the dining car
called Bert through the woods imitating the call of the porter on the Pullman car
All ready
echoed the other boys banging on an old boiler like the Turks do instead of ringing a bell
Oh how pretty
the girls all exclaimed as they beheld the feast in the forest as Nan put it
And indeed it was pretty for at each place was set a long plume of fern leaves with wood violets at the end and what could be more beautiful than such a decoration
Potatoes first
Harry announced because they may get cold and at this order everybody broke the freshly roasted potatoes into the paper napkins and touched it up with the extra butter that had come along
Simply fine
declared Nan with the air of one who knew
Now my old readers will remember how Nan baked such good cake
So she ought to be an authority on baked potatoes dont you think
Next came the sandwiches with the watercress Harry and Bert had gathered before breakfast then and this was a surprise hot chocolate
This was brought out in Marthas cider jug and heated in a kettle over the boys stone furnace
It must be fun to camp out Mabel Herold remarked
Yes just think of the dishes saved added Mildred Manners who always had so many dishes to do at home
And we really dont need them Nan argued passing her tin cup on to Flossie
Think how the soldiers get along
Bert put in
And the firemen lisped Freddie who never forgot the heroes of flame and water
Of course everybody was either sitting on the grass or on a soft stump
These latter conveniences had been brought by the boys for Aunt Sarah and Mrs Bobbsey
Whats that
exclaimed little Flossie as something was plainly moving under the tables cloth
A snake a snake
called everybody at once for indeed under the white linen was plainly to be seen the creeping form of a reptile
While the girls made a run for safety the boys carefully lifted the cloth and went for his snakeship
There he is
There he is
shouted Tom Mason as the thing tried to crawl under the stump lately used as a seat by Mrs Bobbsey
Whack him
called August Stout who armed with a good club made straight for the stump
Look out
Hes a big fellow
Harry declared as the snake attempted to get upright
The boys fell back a little now and as the snake actually stood on the tip of his tail as they do before striking Harry sprang forward and dealt him a heavy blow right on the head that laid the intruder flat
At him boys
At him
called Jack Hopkins while the snake lay wriggling in the grass and the boys making good use of the stunning blow Harry had dealt piled on as many more blows as their clubs could wield
All this time the girls and ladies were over on a knoll high and dry as Nan said and now when assured that the snake was done for they could hardly be induced to come and look at him
Hes a beauty
Harry declared as the boys actually stretched the creature out to measure him
Bert had a rule and when the snake was measured up he was found to be five feet long
Hes a black racer
Jack Hopkins annpounced and the others said they guessed he was
Lucky we saw him first
remarked Harry Racers are very poisonous
Lets go home there might be more
 pleaded Flossie but the boys said the snake hunt was the best fun at the picnic
Goodness
exclaimed Harry suddenly we forgot to let the pigeons loose
and so saying he ran for the basket of birds that hung on the low limb of a pretty maple
First Harry made sure the messages were safe under each birds wing then he called All ready
Snap
went something that sounded like a shot but it wasnt and then away flew the pretty birds to take the messages home to John and Martha
The shot was only a dry stick that Tom Mason snapped to imitate a gun as they do at bicycle races but the effect was quite startling and made the girls jump
It wont take long for them to get home
said Bert watching the birds fly away
Theyll get lost
cried Freddie
No they wont
They know which way we came Nan explained
But they was shut up in the basket argued Freddie
Yet they could see Nan told him
Can pigeons see when theyre asleep
inquired the little fellow
Maybe Nan answered
Then Id like to have pigeon eyes he finished thinking to himself how fine it would be to see everything going on around and be fast asleep too
Oh mamma come quick
called Flossie running along a path at the edge of the wood
Theres a tree over there pouring water and it isnt raining a drop
Everybody set out now to look at the wonderful tree which was soon discovered where Flossie had found it
There it is
she exclaimed
See the water dropping down
A maple tree Harry informed them and that sap is what they make maple sugar out of
Oh catch it
called Freddie promptly holding his cap under the drops
It would take a good deal to make a sugar cake Harry said but maybe we can get enough of it to make a little cake for Freddie
At this the country boys began looking around for young maples and as small limbs of the trees were broken the girls caught the drops in their tin cups
It took quite a while to get a little but by putting it all together a cupful was finally gathered
Now we will put it in a clean milk bottle Mrs Bobbsey said and maybe we can make maple syrup cake tomorrow
Lets have a game of hideandseek Nan suggested
In a twinkling every boy and girl was hidden behind a tree and Nan found herself It
Of course it took a big tree to hide the girls dresses and Nan had no trouble in spying Mildred first
Soon the game was going along merrily and the boys and girls were out of breath trying to get home free
Wheres Roy
exclaimed Tom Mason the little boys brother
Hiding somewhere Bessie ventured for it only seemed a minute before when the little fat boy who was Freddies companion had been with the others
But where is he
they all soon exclaimed in alarm as call after call brought no answer
Over at the maple tree
Harry thought
Down at the spring Nan said
Looking for flowers Flossie guessed
But all these spots were searched and the little boy was not found
Oh maybe the giants have stoled him
Freddie cried
Or maybe the childrens hawk has took him away Flossie sobbed
Meanwhile everybody searched and searched but no Roy could they find
The boat
suddenly exclaimed Tom making a dash for the pond that ran along at the foot of a steep hill
There he is
There he is
the brother yelled as getting over the edge of the hill Tom was now in full view of the pond
And in the boat called Harry close at Toms heels
Hes drifting away
screamed Bert
Oh quick save him
Just as the boys said the little fellow was in the boat and drifting
He did not seem to realize his danger for as he floated along he ran his little fat hand through the water as happily as if he had been in a steam launch talking to the captain
Can you swim
the boys asked Bert who of course had learned that useful art long ago
Shes quite a long way out Tom said But we must be careful not to frighten him
See he has left the oars here
Bert and I can carry one out and swim with one hand
Harry and Jack can you manage the other
The boys said they could and quickly as the heaviest clothes could be thrown off they were striking out in the little lake toward the baby in the boat
He was only Freddies age you know and perhaps more of a baby than the goodnatured Bobbsey boy
Sit still Roy called the anxious girl from the shore fearing Roy would upset the boat as the boys neared him
It was hard work to swim and carry oars but our brave boys managed to do it in time to save Roy
For not a great way down the stream were an old water wheel and a dam
Should the boat drift there what would become of little Roy
Mrs Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah were worrying over this as the boys were making their way to the boat
Easy now
called Bert
Here we are and at that moment the first pair of swimmers climbed carefully into the boat one from each side so as not to tip it over
Jack and Harry were not long in following and as the boys all sat in the pretty green rowboat with their white underclothing answering for athletic suits their looked just like a crew of real oarsmen
Hurrah hurrah
came shout after shout from the bank
Then as the girls heard the rumble of wheels through the grove they all hurried off to gather up the stuff quickly and be ready to start as soon as the boys dressed again
The wet underclothing of course was carried home in one of the empty baskets that Freddie ran back over the hill with to save the tired boys the extra walk
Here they are
Here they are
called the girls as the two little fellows Roy and Freddie with the basket of wet clothes between them marched first then came the two pairs of athletes who proved they were good swimmers by pushing the heavy oars safely to the drifting boat
And all the things that happened
exclaimed Flossie as John handed her into the hay wagon
That made the picnic lively
declared John and alls well that ends well you know
So the picnic was over and all were happy and tired enough to go to bed early that night as Nan said seeing the little ones falling asleep in hay wagon on their way home
CHAPTER IX FOURTH OF JULY The day following the picnic was July third and as the Meadow Brook children were pretty well tired out from romping in the woods they were glad of a days rest before entering upon the festivities of Independence Day
How much have you got
Tom Mason asked the Bobbsey boys
Fifty cents together twentyfive cents each Harry announced
Well Ive got thirtyfive and we had better get our stuff early for Stimpson sold out before noon last year concluded Tom
I have to get torpedoes for Freddie and Flossie and Chinese firecrackers for Nan Bert remarked as they started for the little country grocery store
I guess Ill buy a few snakes they look so funny coiling out Tom said
Im going to have sky rockets and Roman candles
Everybody said they were the prettiest last year said Harry
If they have red fire I must get some of it for the girls thoughtful Bert remarked
But at the store the boys had to take just what they could get as Stimpsons supply was very limited
Lets make up a parade
someone suggested and this being agreed upon the boys started a canvass from house to house to get all the boys along Meadow Brook road to take part in the procession
Can the little ones come too
August Stout asked because he always had to look out for his small brother when there was any danger like fireworks around
Yes and were goin to let the girls march in a division by themselves Bert told him
My sister Nan is going to be captain and well leave all the girls parts to her
Be sure and bring your flag Harry cautioned Jack Hopkins
How would the goat wagons do
Jack asked
Fine we could let Roy and Freddie ride in them said Bert
Tell any of the other fellows who have goat teams to bring them along too
Eight oclock sharp at our lane Harry told them for the place and time of meeting
Then they went along to finish the arrangements
Dont tell the boys Nan whispered to Mildred as they too made their way to Stimpsons
Wont they be surprised
exclaimed Mabel
Yes and I am going to carry a real Betsy Ross flag one with thirteen stars you know
Oh yes Betsy Ross made the first flag didnt she
remarked Mildred trying to catch up on history
Well have ten big girls Nan counted
Then with Flossie as Liberty we will want Bessie and Nettie for her assistants
Attendants Mabel corrected for she had seen a city parade like that once
It was a busy day for everybody and when Mr Bobbsey came up on the train from Lakeport that evening he carried boxes and boxes of fireworks for the boys and girls and even some for the grown folks too
The girls could hardly sleep that night they were so excited over their part but the boys of course were used to that sort of thing and only slept sounder with the fun in prospect
Are you awake Bert
called Harry so early the next morning that the sun was hardly up yet
Yep replied the cousin jumping out of bed and hastily dressing for the firing of the first gun
The boys crept through the house very quietly then ran to the barn for their ammunition
Three big giant firecrackers were placed in the road directly in front of the house
Be careful
whispered Bert theyre full of powder
But Harry was always careful with fireworks and when he touched the fuses to the cannons he made away quickly before they exploded
Bang
Bang
Bang
Hurrah
shouted Freddie answering the call from his window Ill be right down
All the others too were aroused by the first guns so that in a very short time there were many boys in the road firing so many kinds of firecrackers that Meadow Brook resounded like a real war fort under fire
Ouch
yelled Tom Mason the first one to bum his fingers
A sisser caught me right on the thumb
But such small accidents were not given much attention and soon Tom was lighting the little red crackers as merrily as before
Go on back girls
called Bert
Youll get your dresses burnt if you dont
The girls were coming too near the battlements then and Bert did well to warn them off
Freddie and Flossie were having a great time throwing their little torpedoes at Mr Bobbsey and Uncle Daniel who were seated on the piazza watching the sport
Snoop and Fluffy too came in for a scare for Freddie tossed a couple of torpedoes on the kitchen hearth where the kittens were sleeping
The boys were having such fun they could hardly be induced to come in for breakfast but they finally did stop long enough to eat a spare meal
Its time to get ready
whispered Nan to Bert for the parade had been kept secret from the grown folks
At the girls place of meeting the coach house Nan found all her company waiting and anxious to dress
Just tie your scarfs loose under your left arm ordered Captain Nan and the girls quickly obeyed like true cadets
The broad redwhiteandblue bunting was very pretty over the girls white dresses and indeed the cadets looked as if they would outdo the regulars unless the boys too had surprises in store
Wheres Nettie
suddenly asked Nan missing a poor little girl who had been invited
She wouldnt come because she had no white dress Mildred answered
Oh what a shame shell be so disappointed
Besides we need her to make a full line Nan said
Just wait a minute
Lock the door after me and before the others knew what she was going to do Nan ran off to the house got one of her own white dresses rolled it up neatly and was over the fields to Netties house in a few minutes
When Nan came back she brought Nettie with her and not one of her companions knew it was Nans dress that Nettie wore
Soon all the scarfs were tied and the flags arranged
Then Flossie had to be dressed
She wore a light blue dress with gold stars on it and on her pretty yellow curls she had a real Liberty crown
Then she had the cleanest brightest flag and what a pretty picture she made
Oh isnt she sweet
all the girls exclaimed in admiration and indeed she was a little beauty in her Liberty costume
There go the drums
Nan declared
We must be careful to get down the lane without being seen
This was easily managed and now the girls and boys met at the end of the lane
Hurrah
hurrah
shouted the boys beating the drums and blowing their horns to welcome the girls
Oh dont you look fine
exclaimed Harry who was captain of the boys
And dont you too
Nan answered for indeed the boys had such funny big hats on and so many flags and other redwhiteandblue things that they too made a fine appearance
And Freddie
exclaimed the girls
Isnt he a lovely Uncle Sam
Freddie was dressed in the striped suit Uncle Sam always wears and had on his yellow curls a tall white hat
He was to ride in Jack Hopkins goat wagon
Fall in
called Harry and at the word all the companies fell in line
Cadets first ordered the captain
Then Flossie walked the very first one
After her came Nan and her company
No one noticed that Netties eyes were a little red from crying
She had been so disappointed at first when she thought she couldnt go in the parade
After the girls came Freddie as Uncle Sam in the goat wagon led by Bert for fear the goat might run away then fifteen boys all with drums or fifes or some other things with which to make a noise
Roy was in the second division with his wagon and last of all came the funniest thing
A boy dressed up like a bear with a big sign on him TEDDY
He had a gun under his arm and looked too comical for anything
It was quite warm to wear a big fur robe and false face but under this was Jack Hopkins the bear Teddy and he didnt mind being warm when he made everybody laugh so
Right foot left foot right foot forward march
called Nan and the procession started up the path straight for the Bobbsey house
Goodness gracious sakes alive
Do come see de childrens
Ha ha
Dat sure am a parade
called Dinah running through the house to the front door to view the procession
Oh isnt it just beautiful
Martha echoed close at Dinahs heels
My
exclaimed Mrs Bobbsey how did they ever get made up so pretty
And look at Flossie
exclaimed Aunt Sarah
And see Freddie
put in Uncle Daniel
Oh we must get the camera
Mr Bobbsey declared while the whole household all excited stood out on the porch when the parade advanced
Such drumming and such tooting of fifes and horns
Freddies chariot was now in line with the front stoop and he raised his tall hat to the ladies like a real Uncle Sam
Oh the bear
the bear
called everybody as they saw Teddy coming up
Thats great continued Uncle Daniel
By this time Mr Bobbsey had returned with the camera
Halt
called Harry and the procession stood still
Look this way
There now all ready said Mr Bobbsey and snap went the camera on as pretty a picture as ever covered a plate
Right wheel
forward march
called Nan again and amid drumming and tooting the procession started off to parade through the center of Meadow Brook
CHAPTER X A GREAT DAY Never before had such a parade been seen in the little country place and all along the road cheer after cheer greeted our young friends for even the few old soldiers who lived in Meadow Brook enjoyed the childrens Fourth of July fun
By lunch time the procession had covered all the ground planned so from the postoffice the cadets and regulars started back over the shady country road
And at home they found a surprise awaiting them
Ice cream on the lawn for everybody in the parade
Aunt Sarah and Uncle Daniel had set out all the garden benches and with the two kinds of ice cream made by Dinah and Martha besides the cookies and jumbles Aunt Sarah supplied with icecold lemonade that John passed around surely the tired little soldiers and cadets had splendid refreshment
My goat almost runned away
lisped Freddie
But I held on tight like a real fireman
And mine wanted to stop and eat grass in the middle of the big parade Roy told them
Now eat up your ice cream
Nettie have some more
Jack you surely need two plates after carrying that bear skin said Uncle Daniel
The youngsters did not have to be urged to eat some more of the good things and so it took quite a while to finish up the rations as Uncle Daniel said
Theyre goin to shoot the old cannon off father Harry told Uncle Daniel and were all going over on the pond bank to see them at three oclock
Theyre foolish to put powder in that old cracked gun remarked Uncle Daniel
Take care if you go over that you all keep at a safe distance
It was not long until three oclock and then when all the redwhiteand blue things had been stored away for another year the boys hurried off to see Peter Burns fire the old cannon
Quite a crowd of people had gathered about the pond bank which was a high green wall like that which surrounds a reservoir
Peter was busy stuffing the powder in the old gun and all the others looked on anxiously
Lets go up in that big limb of the willow tree suggested Bert
We can see it all then and be out of range of the fire
So the boys climbed up in the low willow that leaned over the pond bank
Theyre almost ready Harry said seeing the crowd scatter
Look out
yelled Peter getting hold of the long string that would fire the gun
Peter gave it a tug then another
Everybody held their breath expecting to hear an awful bang but the gun didnt go off
Very cautiously Peter stepped nearer the cannon to see what might be the matter when the next instant with a terrific report the whole cannon flew up in the air
Peter fell back
His hat seemed to go up with the gun
Oh hes killed
yelled the people
Poor Peter
gasped Harry
He ought to know better
said Mr Mason
Father said that cannon was dangerous Harry added
By this time the crowd had surrounded Peter who lay so still and looked so white
The Bobbsey boys climbed down from the tree and joined the others
Hes only unconscious from the shock spoke up Mr Mason who was leaning down very close to Peter
Stand back and give him air
The crowd fell back now and some of the boys looked around to find the pieces of cannon
Dont touch it said Tom Mason as a little fellow attempted to pick up a piece of the old gun
There might be powder in it half lighted
Mrs Burns had run over from her home at the report of the accident and she was now bathing Peters face with water from the pond
Hes subject to fainting spells she told the frightened people and I think hell be all right when he comes to
Peter looked around then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
Did it go off
he smiled remembering the big report
Guess it did and you went off with it Mr Mason said
How do you feel
Oh Ill be all right when my head clears a bit
I guess I fainted
So you did said Mrs Burns and theres no use scolding you for firing that old gun
Come home now and go to bed you have had all the fireworks you want for one day
Quite a crowd followed Peter over to his home for they could not believe he was not in any way hurt
Let us go home Harry said to his cousin
We have to get all our fireworks ready before evening
The boys found all at home enjoying themselves
Freddies torpedoes still held out and Flossie had a few more snakes left
Nan had company on the lawn and it indeed was an ideal Fourth of July
Look at the balloon
called John from the carriage house
Its going to land in the orchard
This announcement caused all the children to hurry up to the orchard for everybody likes to catch a balloon
Theres a man in it John exclaimed as the big ball tossed around in the air
Yes thats the balloon that went up from the farmers picnic said Harry
The next minute a parachute shot out from the balloon and hanging to it the form of a man could be seen
Oh hell fall
cried Freddie all excited
Lets catch him  in something
Hes all right John assured the little boy
That umbrella keeps him from coming down too quickly
How does it
Freddie asked
Why you see sonny the air gets under the umbrella and holds it up
The mans weight then brings it down gently
Oh maybe he will let us fly up in it Freddie remarked much interested
Here he comes
here he comes
the boys called and sure enough the big parachute with the man dangling on it was now coming right down  down  in the harvestapple tree
Hello there
called the man from above losing the colored umbrella and quickly dropping himself from the low tree
Hello yourself
answered John
Did you have a nice ride
First class replied the man with the stars on his shirt
But Ive got a long walk back to the grove
Could I hire a bicycle around here
Harry spoke to his father and then quickly decided to let the balloon man ride his bicycle down to the picnic grounds
You can leave it at the icecream stand Harry told the stranger
I know the man there and he will take care of it for me until I call for it
The children were delighted to talk to a real live man that had been up in a balloon and the balloonist was indeed very pleasant with the little ones
He took Freddie up in his arms and told him all about how it felt to be up in the sky
Youre a truly fireman
Freddie said after listening to all the dangers there are so far above ground
Im a real fireman too
Just then the balloon that had been tossing about in the air came down in the other end of the orchard
Well there
exclaimed the man
Thats good luck
Now whichever one of you boys gets that balloon first will get ten dollars
Thats what we pay for bringing it back
With a dash every boy started for the spot where the balloon had landed
There were quite a few others besides the Bobbseys and they tumbled over each other trying to get there first
Ned Prentice Netties brother was one of the best runners and he cut across the orchard to get a clear way out of the crowd
Go it Bert
called John
Keep it up Harry
yelled someone else
Youd get it Tom
came another voice
But Ned was not in the regular race and nobody noticed him
Theyve got it called the excited girls
Its Harry
No its Bert 
Tisnt either  its Ned
called John as the only poor boy in the crowd proudly touched the big empty gasbag
Three cheers for Ned
called Uncle Daniel for he and Mr Bobbsey had joined in the crowd
Hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
shouted all the boys goodnaturedly for Ned was a favorite companion besides being one who really needed the money
Suppose we drive down Uncle Daniel suggested
Then we can bring Ned back with his ten dollars
This was agreed upon as a good plan and as quickly as John had hitched up the big wagon ail the boys piled in with the aeronaut and started for the grove
CHAPTER XI THE LITTLE GARDENERS When little Ned Prentice put the tendollat bill in his mothers hand on that pleasant Fourth of July evening he felt like a man
His mother could hardly believe the story of Neds getting the money just for finding a balloon but when it was explained how valuable the balloon was and how it sometimes takes days of searching in the woods to find one after the balloonist lets go and drops down with his parachute she was finally convinced that the money rightfully belonged to Ned
No one needs it more than I do Mrs Prentice told Mr Bobbsey who had brought Ned home in the wagon for since the baby was sick we have hardly been able to meet our bills it cost so much for medicine
We were all glad when Ned got there first Harry said politely because we knew he deserved the reward most
As Ned was a poor boy and had to work on farms during vacation his father being dead and only one brother being old enough to go to work the reward turned out a great blessing for ten dollars is a good deal of money for a little boy to earn at one time
Be sure to come up to our fireworks tonight Harry called as they drove away and Ned promptly accepted the invitation
It has certainly been a great Fourth of July
Uncle Daniel exclaimed later in the evening when the children fired off their Roman candles and sky rockets and burned the red fire
The little children had beautiful pinwheels and nigger chasers that they put off on the porch
Then Nan had a big fire balloon that she sent up and they watched it until it was out of sight away over the pond and clear out of Meadow Brook
It was a very tired lot of children that rolled off to sleep that night for indeed it had been a great day for them all
For a few days after the Fourth it rained as it always does on account of all the noise that goes up in the air to shake the clouds
You can play in the coach house Aunt Sarah told the children but be careful not to run in and out and get wet
The children promised to remember and soon they were all out in the big wagon house playing merrily
Freddie climbed in the wagon and made believe it was a big fire engine
Bert attached a bell on the side for him and when he pulled a rope this bell would clang like a chemical apparatus
Nan and Flossie had all their dolls in the pretty new carriage with the soft gray cushions and in this the little girls made believe driving to New York and doing some wonderful shopping
Freddie you be coachman coaxed Flossie because we are inside and have to have someone drive us
But who will put out all the fires
Freddie asked as he clanged the bell vigorously
Make blieve they are all out Flossie told him
But you cant make blieve about fires argued the little fellow cause theyre really
I tell you Nan suggested
We will suppose this is a great big high tallyho party and the ladies always drive them
Ill be away up high on the box but we ought to have someone blow a horn
Ill blow the horn Freddie finally gave in cause I got that big fire out now
So Freddie climbed up on the high coach with his sisters and blew the horn until Nan told them they had reached New York and were going to stop for dinner
There were so many splendid things to play with in the coach house tables chairs and everything that the Bobbseys hardly knew it before it was lunch time the morning passed so quickly
It cleared up in the afternoon and John asked the children if they wanted to help him do some transplanting
Oh
we would love to Nan answered for she did love gardening
The ground was just right for transplanting after the rain and the tender little lettuce plants were as easy to take up as they were to put down again
I say Nan John told her you can have that little patch over there for your garden
Ill give you a couple of dozen plants and we will see what kind of a farmer you will make
Oh thank you John Nan answered
Ill do just as I have seen you doing and she began to take the little plants in the pasteboard box from one bed to the other
Be careful not to shake the dirt off the roots said John and be sure to put one plant in each place
Put them as far apart here as the length of this little stick and when you put them in the ground press the earth firmly around the roots
Flossie was delighted to help her sister and the two girls made a very nice garden indeed
Lets put little stones around the path Flossie suggested and John said they could do this if they would be careful not to let the stones get on the garden
I want to be a planter too called Freddie running up the path to John
But I want to plant radishes he continued cause theyre the reddist
Well you just wait a few minutes sonny said John and Ill show you how to plant radishes
Ill be through with this lettuce in a few minutes
Freddie waited with some impatience running first to Nans garden then back to Johns
Finally John was ready to put in a late crop of radishes
Now you see we make a long drill like this John explained as he took the drill and made a furrow in the soft ground
If it rains again that will be a river said Freddie for he had often played river at home after a rain
Now you see this seed is very fine continued John
But I am going to let you plant it if youre careful
That aint redishes
exclaimed Freddie I want to plant redishes
But this is the seed and thats what makes the radishes John explained
Nope thats black and it cant make it red
argued Freddie
Wait and see the gardener told him
You just take this little paper of seeds and scatter them in the drill
See I have mixed them with sand so they will not grow too thick
Freddie took the small package and kneeling down on the board that John used he dropped the little shower of seeds in the line
Theyre all gone
he told John presently get some more
No thats enough
Now we will see how your crop grows
See I just cover the seed very lightly like mamma covers Freddie when he sleeps in the summer time
Do you cover them more in the winter time too like mamma does 
Freddie asked
Yes indeed I do said the gardener for seeds are just like babies they must be kept warm to grow
Freddie stood watching the line he had planted the seed in
They aint growing yet he said at last
Why dont they come up John 
Oh
laughed the gardener they wont come up right away
They have to wake up first
You will see them above the ground in about a week I guess
This was rather a disappointment to the little fellow who never believed in waiting for anything but he finally consented to let the seeds grow and come back again later to pick the radishes
Look at our garden
called Nan proudly from across the path
Doesnt it look straight and pretty
You did very well indeed said John inspecting the new lettuce patch
Now youll have to keep it clear of weeds and if a dry spell should come you must use the watering can
Ill come up and tend to it every morning Nan declared
I am going to see what kind of lettuce I can raise
Nan had brought with her a beautiful string of pearl beads set in gold the gift of one of her aunts
She was very proud of the pearls and loved to wear them whenever her mother would let her
One afternoon she came to her mother in bitter tears
Oh mamma
she sobbed
The the pearls are gone Gone
Did you lose them
questioned Mrs Bobbsey quickly
Yes
Where
I  I dont know and now Nan cried harder than ever
The news soon spread that the string of pearls were lost and everybody set to work hunting for them
Where do you think you lost em
asked Bert
I  I dont know
I was down in the garden and up the lane and at the well and out in the barn and over to the apple orchard and feeding the chickens and over in the hayfield  and lots of places
Then it will be like looking for a needle in a haystack declared Aunt Sarah
All the next day the boys and girls hunted for the string of pearls and the older folks helped
But the string could not be found
Nan felt very bad over her loss and her mother could do little to console her
I  I sup  suppose Ill never see them again sobbed the girl
Oh I guess theyll turn up some time said Bert hopefully
They cant be lost so very very bad lisped Flossie
Cause they are somewhere on this farm aint they
Yes but the farm is so very big
sighed poor Nan
For a few days Freddie went up to the garden every morning to look for radishes
Then he gave up and declared he knew John had made a mistake and that he didnt plant radishes at all
Nan and Flossie were very faithful attending to their garden and the beautiful light green lettuce grew splendidly being grateful for the good care given it
When can we pick it
Nan asked John as the leaves were getting quite thick
In another week
he told the girls and so they continued to watch for weeds and kept the ground soft around the plants as John had told them
Freddies radishes were above ground now and growing nicely but they thought it best not to tell him as he might pull them up too soon
Nan and Flossie weeded his garden as well as their own and showed they loved to see things grow for they did not mind the work of attending to them
Papa will come up from Lakeport tonight Nan told Flossie and wont he be pleased to see our gardens
That evening when Mr Bobbsey arrived the first thing he had to do was to visit the garden
Why I declare
he exclaimed in real surprise
You have done splendidly
This is a fine lettuce patch
Mrs Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah had also come up to see the girls garden and they too were much surprised at the result of Nans and Flossies work
Oh
screamed Freddie from the other side of the garden
See my redishes
They growed
and before anyone could stop him he pulled up a whole handful of the little green leaves with the tiny red balls on the roots
They growed
They growed
he shouted dancing around in delight
But you must only pick the ripe ones his father told him
And did you really plant them
Mr Bobbsey asked in surprise Yep
John showed me he declared and the girls said that was really Freddies garden
Now Ill tell you Aunt Sarah remarked
We will let our little farmers pick their vegetables for dinner and then we will be able to say just how good they are
At this the girls started in to pick the very biggest heads of lettuce and Freddie looked carefully to get the very reddest radishes in his patch
Finally enough were gathered and down to the kitchen the vegetables were carried
You will have to prepare them for the table Mrs Bobbsey said
Let us see girls what a pretty dish you can make
This was a pleasant task to Nan and Flossie who both always loved to play at housekeeping and when at last Nan brought the dish in to the dinner table everybody said how pretty it looked
Thems my redishes
exclaimed Freddie as he saw the pretty bright red buttons peeping out from between the lettuce leaves
But we can all have some cant we Freddie
his father asked
Yes course you can
But I dont want all my good redishes smothered in that big dish of green stuff he pouted
Now Nan you can serve your vegetables Aunt Sarah said and then Nan very neatly put a few crisp lettuce leaves on each small plate and at the side she placed a few of Freddies radishes with handles on as Dinah said meaning the little green stalks
Just think weve done it all from the garden to the table
Nan exclaimed justly proud of her success at gardening
I done the radishes put in Freddie gulping down a drink of water to wash the bite off his tongue for his radishes were quite hot
Well you have certainly all done very nicely Mrs Bobbsey said
And that kind of play is like going to school for it teaches you important lessons in nature
The girls declared they were going to keep a garden all summer and so they did
It was an unusually warn night and so nearly all the doors were left open when the folks went to bed
Freddie was so worked up over his success as a gardener he could not go to sleep
At last he dozed off but presently he awoke with a start
What was that strange sound ringing in his ears
He sat up and listened
Yes somebody must surely be playing the piano
But what funny music
It seemed to come in funny runs and curious thumps
He called out sharply and his mother came at once to his side
I heard pianoplaying said Freddie and Mrs Bobbsey started for she remembered how Flossie had once told her the same thing
Oh Freddie are you sure
she asked
Sure repeated the little fellow
But it wasnt very good playing
Mrs Bobbsey called Uncle Daniel and the latter lit a lamp and went below into the parlor
Nobody was at the piano or in the room
Ive made a careful examination he said on coming back
I can see nothing unusual
Some of the children left a piece of cake on the keys of the piano thats all
Well cake cant play put in Freddie
Maybe it was a ghost
No you must have been dreaming said his mother
Come go to sleep and presently Freddie dropped off
Mrs Bobbsey was much worried and the next day the older folks talked the matter over but nothing came of it
CHAPTER XII TOMS RUNAWAY Tom Mason is going to bring his colt out this afternoon said Harry to Bert and we can all take turns trying him
Oh is it that pretty little brown horse I saw in the field back of Toms home
asked Bert
Thats him Harry replied
Isnt he a beauty
Yes I would like firstrate to ride him but young horses are awful skittish arent they
Sometimes but this one is partly broken
At any rate we wouldnt have far to fall for he is a little fellow said Harry
So the boys went down to Toms home at the appointed time and there they met Jack Hopkins
Weve made a track around the fields Tom told his companions and we will train him to run around the ring for father thinks he may be a race horse some day hes so swift
You may go first the boys told him as hes your horse
All right
Tom replied making for the stake where Sable the pony was tied
Sable marched along quietly enough and made no objections to Tom getting on his back
There was no saddle but just the bit in the horses mouth and attached to it a short piece of rein
Get app Sable
called Tom snapping a small whip at the ponys side
But instead of going forward the little horse tried to sit down
Whoa
whoa
called the boys but Tom clung to Sables neck and held on in spite of the ponys back being like a toboggan slide
Get off there get off there
urged Tom yet the funny little animal only backed down more
Light a match and set it under his nose Harry suggested
Thats the way to make a balky horse go
Someone had a match which was lighted and put where Sable could sniff the sulphur
Look out
Hold on Tom
yelled the boys all at once for at that instant Sable bolted off like a deer
Hes running away
called Bert which was plain to be seen for Tom could neither turn him this way or that but had all he could do to hold on the frightened animals neck
If he throws him Tom will surely be hurt
Harry exclaimed and the boys ran as fast as they could across the field after the runaway
Whoa
whoa 
whoa
called everybody after the horse but that made not the slightest difference to Sable who just went as if the woods were afire
Suddenly he turned and dashed straight up a big hill and over into a neighbors cornfield
Oh mercy
cried Harry those people are so mean about their garden theyll have Tom arrested if theres any corn broken
Of course it was impossible for a runaway horse to go through a field of corn and do no damage and Tom realized this too
By this time the dogs were out barking furiously and altogether there was wild excitement
At one and of the field there was a high board fence
If I could only get him there he would have to stop thought Tom and suddenly he gave Sable a jerk in that direction
Drop off Tom drop off
yelled the boys
Hell throw you against the fence
But at that minute the little horse threw himself against the boards in such a way that Tom slid off yet held tightly to the reins
The horse fell quite exhausted
As quickly as they could get there the boys came up to help Tom
Hurry
said Harry there is scarcely any corn broken and we can get away before the Trimbles see us
Theyre away back in the fields planting late cabbage
Tom felt hardly able to walk but he limped along while Harry led Sable carefully between the cornhills
It was only a few feet to the edge of the field and then they were all safe on the road again
Are you hurt
the boys asked Tom when finally they had a chance to speak about the runaway
I feel as if I had dropped from a balloon onto a lot of cobblestones Tom answered but I guess thats only the shaking up I got
That pony certainly can go
Yes indeed Harry admitted I guess he doesnt like the smell of sulphur matches
Lucky he was not injured with that fall against the fence
I found I had to throw him Tom said and I thought the fence was softer than a tree
I suppose we ought to make him run until he is played out said Bert Thats the way to cure a horse of running away
But none of the boys felt like risking their bones even to cure Sable so the panting animal was led to the stable and for the rest of the day allowed to think over his bad conduct
But that was not the last of the runaway for in the evening just after supper old Mr Trimble paid a visit to Toms father
I came over to tell you what a scallywag of a boy youve got began the cross old man
He and a lot of young loafers took a horse and drove him all through my cornfield today and now youve got to pay the damages
My son is not a scallywag Mr Mason declared and if you call him names like loafer and scallywag Ill make you pay damages
Oh
you will eh
the other sneered
Think Im afraid of an old constable up here do you
Well now see here Mr Mason said Be reasonable and do not quarrel over an accident
If any corn is knocked down Ill get Tom to fix it up if its broken down we will see what it would cost to replace it
But the boys did not do it purposely and it was worse for Tom than anyone else for hes all black and blue from the hard knocks he got
At this the cross man quieted down and said Well he would see about it
Mr Trimble was one of those queer people who believe all a boy is good for is doing mischief and all a boy deserves is scolding or beating
Perhaps this was because he had no sons of his own and therefore had no regard for the sons of other people
Mr Mason went directly to the cornfield with his neighbor
He looked carefully over every hill and with a spade and hoe he was able to put back into place the few stalks that had been knocked down in Sables flight
There now said Mr Mason I guess that corn is as good as ever
If it wants any more hoeing Tom will come around in the morning and do it
He is too stiff to move tonight
So that ended the runaway except for a very lame boy Tom Mason who had to limp around for a day or two from stiffness
How would you like to be a jockey
laughed his companions
You held on like a champion but you were not in training for the banging you got
Well I guess Sable will make a fine racehorse said Tom when hes broken
But it will take someone stronger than I am to break him in
The next afternoon all the boys went fishing
They had been out quite late the night before to find the night walkers for bait as those little worms only come out of the ground after dark
Bert had a new line his father brought from Lakeport and the others boys had nets and hooks as most country boys who live near streams are always fond of fishing
Lets go over to the cove Harry said when they all started off
Theres lots of good fish in that dark corner
So the cove was chosen as a good spot to fish from and soon the Bobbsey boys and their friends were Iying around the edge of the deep clear stream waiting for a bite
Bert was the first to jerk his line and he brought it up with such force that the chubfish on his hook slapped Harry right in the face
Look out
called Harry trying to dodge the flapping fish
Put your catch down
Hes a good one but I dont care about having him kiss me that way again
All the boys laughed at Bert who was a green fisherman they said
The fish was really a very nice plump chub and weighed more than a pound
He floundered around in the basket and flapped his tail wildly trying to get away from them
Ive got one called Tom next at the same moment pulling his line and bringing up a pretty little sunfish
Now sunnies are not considered good eating so Toms catch did not come up to Berts but it was put in the basket just the same
Im going out on the springboard August Stout announced stepping cautiously out on the board from which good swimmers dived
You know you cant swim August said Harry and if you get a catch and jerk it youll tumble in
Oh
Ill be all right August answered lying down flat on the narrow springboard and dropping his line
For a time all the boys lay watching for a bite
No one spoke for sometimes they say fish are very sensitive to sound and go in another direction if they hear a voice
It was a beautiful July day and perhaps the boys were a little lazy
At any rate they all became so quiet the little woodpeckers on the trees went on with their work pecking at the tree bark as if no human being was in sight
Suddenly there was a big splash
August
yelled all the boys at once for indeed Angust was gone from the springboard
Quick
called Harry to his companions
He cant swim
The next minute the boy in the water came to the top and threw up his arm
But no one was near enough to reach it
Strike out August
yelled Bert
Were coming and one boy after the other dropped in the water now having thrown off their heavy clothing
Oh where is he
screamed Bert in terror for no movement on the waters surface showed them where August was
Here
cried Tom Mason who was quite a distance out
Here he is
Help
come quick
No need to urge the boys to hasten for all realized the danger their companion was in
Dont pull down August went on Tom
Try to help yourself or youll pull me under
Harry had around his neck a strong piece of rope he picked up as he made a dive into the water
Take hold of this he called to August and we can all pull
As the rope was put in Augusts hand the other boys all took hold and soon towed the unfortunate boy in
Hes very weak said Harry when they pulled August up on the shore
I guess he has swallowed a lot of water
We better roll him on the grass and work his arms up and down
That will revive him
August was indeed very weak and had had a narrow escape
For some time his companions worked over him before he opened his eyes and spoke
Oh
he murmured at last Im so sick
I guess you are August said Tom but youll be all right soon
They lifted him carefully under a shady tree and removed his wet clothing
Ill run over to Smiths and get him something to wear home said Harry who hurried across lots and presently returned with an old suit of clothes
August was able to dress himself now and as soon as he felt strong enough the boys helped him home
You can have my fish August said Bert nobly
And mine too Tom added
August did not want to accept the boys offers at first but at last they prevailed upon him to do so
I think I fell asleep said he referring to the accident
Guess we all did
added Harry for we only woke up when we heard the splash
It seems the number of accidents country boys have only make them truer friends for all the things that happened in Meadow Brook made each boy think more of his companions both in being grateful for the help given and being glad no dear friends life was lost
CHAPTER XIII PICKING PEAS Mother said Harry using that loved name to show that what he was about to say was something important Peter Burns is sick
He has not been able to work since the cannon exploded and gave him the shock and all his peas are spoiling because theres no one to pick them
Mrs Burns hired some boys yesterday but they broke down so many vines she had to stop them and mother would you mind if Bert and I picked some today
The sun is not hot
Why my dear replied Aunt Sarah it would be very nice of you to help Peter he has always been a kind neighbor
I dont think it would do you any harm to pick peas on a cool day like this
Bert can ask his mother and if she is satisfied you can put on your play overalls and go right along
Both boys were given the desired permission and when Tom and Jack heard where the Bobbseys were going they said at once they would go along
Are you sure your mother wont mind
Mrs Burns asked the boys knowing Harrys folks did not need the money paid to pick the peas
Of course Im very glad to have you if your mothers are satisfied
Soon each boy had a big basket under his arm and was off for the beautiful field of soft green peas that stretched along the pond bank at the side of Mrs Burns home
Now peas are quite an expensive vegetable when they come in first and farmers who have big fields of them depend upon the return from the crop as an important part of the summers income
But the peas must be picked just as soon as they are ripe or else they will spoil
This was why Harry got his friends to turn in to help poor Peter Burns
Ill go down this row and you take that  suggested Bert to Harry
Then we can talk to each other without hollering
All right Harry replied snapping the peas off the vines and dropping them into his basket like a real farmer
Lets have a race called Tom
see who gets his basket full first
But no skipping for big ones put in Jack
You have to pick every ripe one
The boys all started in at the top of the hill each working two rows at a time
They were so interested in the race that scarcely a word was spoken
The peas were plentiful and ripe too so that the baskets were filling up quickly
Mrs Burns herself was picking in fact she had been in the field since the very first peep of dawn and she would be sure to stay out until the darkness would drive her in
You are fine pickers she told the boys seeing how quickly they worked
I pay ten cents a basket you know
I guess we can earn a dollar a day at this rate laughed Tom whose basket was almost full
Im done called Jack from his row
No youre not said Harry you have to cover the rim
Oh
exclaimed Jack who had just slipped between the rows
Oh
there goes my basket
And sure enough the big basket had been upset in Jacks fall and most of the peas were scattered on the ground
Ha
ha
laughed Bert
Im first
My basket is full
Im next
called Tom picking his basket up in his arms
Well Ill be last I guess laughed Tom trying hard to pick up the scattered peas
Theres mine
called Harry and now all the boys carried their baskets to the big bag at the end of the field and dumped them in
It wont take long to fill the bag said Harry and it will be so good for Peter to have them ready for tomorrow is market day
So the boys worked on right along until lunch time each having picked four big baskets full
August Stout came along and helped some too but he could not stay long as he had to cut some clothes poles for his mother
Well I declare
said Mrs Burns looking at the three full bags the boys had picked
Isnt that splendid
But I cant pay until Peter comes from market
We just did it for fun answered Harry
We dont want any pay
Indeed you must have forty cents apiece ten cents a basket she insisted
See what a good load you have picked
No really Mrs Burns mother wouldnt like us to take the money Harry declared
We are glad to have helped you and it was only fun
Poor Mrs Burns was so grateful she had to wipe her eyes with her gingham apron
Well she said finally There are some people in this world who talk about charity but a good boy is a gift from heaven and she said this just like a prayer of blessing on the boys who had helped her
The crop would have been spoiled tomorrow remarked Tom as he and his companions started up the road
Im awfully glad you thought of helping her Harry
It seemed all that day everything went right for the boys they did not have even a single mishap in their games or wanderings
Perhaps it was because they felt so happy over having done a good turn for a poor neighbor
Say fellows Tom said later while they sat on the pond bank trying to see something interesting in the cool clear water what do you say if we make up a circus
Fine the others answered but what will be the show
Animals of course continued Tom weve got plenty around here havent we
Well some Harry admitted
Theres Sable for instance
At this the boys all laughed at Tom remembering the runaway
Well I could be a cowboy and ride him just the same spoke up Tom
I rode him around the track yesterday and he went all right
He was only scared with that sulphur match when he ran away
A circus would be fine Bert put in
We could have Frisky as the Sacred Calf
And Snoopy as the Wild Cat said Harry
And two trained goats August added
And a real human bear Teddy
suggested Jack
Then a cage of pigeons went on Harry
Lets get them all in training said Tom jumping up suddenly anxious to begin the sport
I tell you
Harry planned
We can each train our own animals and then we can bring them together in a wellorganized circus
When will we have it
August asked impatiently
About next week Harry thought and this was decided upon
During the interval the boys were so busy training that they had little time for other sports but the girls found outdoor life quite as interesting as their brothers did and now made many discoveries in and about the pretty woodlands
Oh we saw the prettiest little rabbits today Nan told her mother after a trip in the woods
Flossie and Freddie were sitting on an old stump when two rabbits ran right across the road in front of them
Freddie ran after them as far as he could go in the brushwood but of course no one can go as fast as a rabbit
And the squirrels Flossie told them
I think the squirrels are the prettiest things that live in the woods
They have tails just like mammas feather boa and they walk sitting up so cute
Oh I think the rabbits are the nicest lisped Freddie cause they are Bunnies and Bunnies bring Easter eggs
And we have made the loveliest fern garden up back of the swing said Flossie
We got a whole basket of ferns in the woods and transplanted them
In the center we have some lovely Jackin thepulpits Nan added
Some are light green striped and the largest are purple with gold stripes
The Jacks stand up straight just like real live boys preaching in a pulpit
Dont you think mamma asked Flossie that daisies and violets make a lovely garden
I have a round place in the middle of our wild flower bed just full of light blue violets and white daisies
All flowers are beautiful their mamma told them but I do think with Flossie that daisies and violets are very sweet
And mamma we got a big piece of the loveliest green moss
It is just like real velvet said Flossie
We found a place all covered with it down by the pond under the dark cedar trees
Nan said it wouldnt grow in our garden but I brought some home to try
I put it in a cool dark place and Im going to put lots of water on it every day
Moss must be very cool and damp to grow Mrs Bobbsey replied
I remember how disappointed I used to be when I was a little girl and tried to make it grow around my geraniums
It would always dry up and turn brown in a few days
Oh called Freddie from his garden under the cherry tree come quick
Look at the funny bugs
Nan and Flossie hurried to where their little brother had dug a hole in the earth
Theyre mice
exclaimed Nan
Oh arent they cute
Lets catch them
Call Bert or Harry
While Flossie ran to tell Bert Nan watched the tiny mice so that they would not get away
Its a nest of field mice Harry told them
Well put them in a cage and have them in our circus
But theyre my mice cried Freddie and I wont let anybody have them
Were only going to help you take care of them in a little box
Oh theres the mother  catch her Harry called Bert
The mother mouse was not so easy to catch however and the boys had quite a chase after her
At last she ran into a tin box the boys had sunk in the ground when playing golf
Here Harry caught the frightened little creature
Ive got a queer kind of a trap Harry said
Its just like a cage
We can put them in this until we build a larger one
We can make one out of a box with a wire door
The mice were the smallest cutest things not larger than Freddies thumb
They hardly looked like mice at all but like some queer little bugs
They were put in the cage trap mother and all and then Bert got them a bit of cheese from the kitchen
What
Feed mice
exclaimed Dinah Sakes alive chile
you go bringing dem mice in de house to eat all our cake and pie
You just better drown dem in de brook before dey bring a whole lot more mices around here
Well keep them away from the house Bert told Dinah
Were going to have a circus you know and these will be our trained mice
Freddie of course was delighted with the little things and wanted to dig for more
I tell you
said Bert
We might catch butterflies and have them under a big glass on the table with all the small animals  That would be good Harry agreed
We could catch some big brown ones and some little fancy ones
Then after dark we could get some big moths down by the postoffice electric light
The girls too went catching butterflies
Nan was able to secure four or five yellow ones in the flower garden near the porch and Flossie got two of the small brown variety in the nasturtium bed
Harry and Bert searched in the close syringa bushes where the nests are usually found
Oh
look at this one
called Freddie coming up with a great green butterfly
Is it bird
he asked
See how big it is
It really was very large and had such beautiful wings it might easily be mistaken for some strange bird
We will try to keep them alive said Harry and perhaps we can get mas big glass globe to put them in
She has one she used to put wax flowers under
And oh say
exclaimed Bert couldnt we have an aquarium with snakes and turtles and toads in
Fine
declared Harry
Weve got a big glass tank I used to have gold fish in
Well get the other fellows to help catch some snakes fish and turtles and toads and  and anything else that will stand water
Then what a time they had hunting for reptiles
It seemed each boy had a different variety on his premises
August Stout brought three turtles and Jack Hopkins caught two snakes under a big stone in his back yard
Tom Mason supplied four lovely gold fish while Ned Prentice brought three bright green frogs
I can catch hoptoads declared Freddie and sure enough the little fellow brought two big ones and a baby toad in his hat down to the boys who had their collection in a glass tank in the barn
We cant put the snakes in with the others or theyll eat them up said Jack
Ill get a big glass jar for the snakes
And say
said Harry
Will we charge admission to the show
Sure  five cents each said Tom and give the money to the freshair camp over on the mountain
This was considered a good plan and now it was only a few days more until Wednesday  the day of the circus
CHAPTER XIV THE CIRCUS News of the circus had spread from one end of Meadow Brook to the other
Every boy and girl in the place expected to get in to see the sights and even some grown folks had made up their minds from what they heard there would be something interesting for them to see and so they decided to go too
Mrs Bobbsey Aunt Sarah Dinah and Martha had bought tickets for reserved seats these cost ten cents each
Then Mildred Manners was going to bring her mother and her big sister and Mabel Herold expected to have her mother with her also
Mr Bobbsey was coming up from Lakeport purposely to see the circus and Uncle Daniel had helped the boys put up the seats and fix things generally
A big tent had been borrowed from the Herolds they were only out at Meadow Brook for the summer and this tent was erected in the open field between the Bobbsey and the Mason farms alongside the track where Tom had tried Sable
The tent had large flaps that opened up the entire front so that all the exhibits could be shown nicely to the people on the seats out side
The seats were made of boards set on most anything that would hold them with a few garden benches for reserved seats at the front
Everything was ready and the circus day came at last
Lucky it isnt raining the boys declared as they rushed around putting the final touches to everything
August Stout was appointed to collect the tickets and Ned Prentice was to show the people to their seats
Two oclock
Only one hour more
Lots of children came early to get good seats
Roy Mason sat right in the front row alongside of Freddie
Nettie Prentice was on the very first bench back of the reserved seats
The Herolds came next and had Aunt Sarahs front garden bench the red one
Mildred Manners folks paid ten cents each too and they had the big green bench from the side porch
Give Mrs Burns a front seat Harry whispered to Ned as the busy farmers wife actually stopped her work to see what all the excitement was about
The Bobbseys had come  Mr Bobbsey and all  and Dinah wore her best black bonnet
When will it begin
Flossie asked just trembling with excitement
I saw Harry and Bert go in the tent some time ago whispered Nan and see they are loosing the tent flap
There was a shout of applause when Harry appeared
He actually wore a swallowtail coat and had on a choker  a very high collar  and a bright green tie
He wore long trousers too and looked so queer even Aunt Sarah had to laugh when she saw him
Oh
exclaimed all the children when they looked inside the tent
Isnt it grand
whispered Flossie
Then Bert stepped up on the soap box in the middle of the ring
Ladies and gentlemen he began making a profound bow ladies and gentlemen
Then everybody roared laughing
Bert had to wait until they got through laughing at his funny costume which was a good deal like Harrys only the latter wore a red tie
I In a few moments Bert went on again
Ladies and gentlemen
Our first number is Frisky the Sacred Calf of India
he exclaimed imitating that queervoiced man called a Barker and used at circuses
Snap
snap
went Berts whip and out from a side place back of a big screen came Jack Hopkins dressed like a real clown leading our old friend Frisky the runaway calf
How awfully funny it was
The calf had over him a plush portiere that reached clear down to the ground and over each ear was tied a longhandled feather duster
Such laughing and clapping as greeted this first number
Frisky just turned around square in front and looked the people straight in the face
This funny move made Mr Bobbsey die laughing as Flossie said and Uncle Daniel too was hilarious
The sacred calf is too sacred to smile laughed Uncle Daniel while Dinah and Martha just roared
The children didnt think they ought to laugh out loud and spoil the show even Freddie raised his finger to Dinah
Suddenly the clown jumped on the calfs back
He tried to stand on his head
Then he turned a somersault on to the sawdust
Everybody clapped hard now and the children began to shout
But Bert snapped his whip and the clown went down on his hands and knees to apologize
Of course clowns are not supposed to speak so Jack did everything by pantomime
Next he came around and kissed Frisky
This made everybody roar again and no matter what the clown did it certainly looked very funny
Finally Bert snapped his whip three times and the clown jumped on Friskys back over the plush curtain and all and rode off
Wasnt that splendid
everybody exclaimed
I really never enjoyed a big circus more than this
remarked Mrs Bobbsey to Mrs Burns
The others all said nice things too and then Bert announced the next turn
Ladies and gentlemen he began again our next number will introduce to you the famous wildcats Snoop and Fluffy
Real wildcats from the jungle and this is the first  time  they  have ever been exhibited in  this country
Snap went the whip and out came Harry with our little kitten friends one on each arm
He whistled and Snoop climbed on his shoulder
He whistled again and Fluffy climbed on the other shoulder
This brought the house down as Uncle Daniel said and there was so much noise the kittens looked frightened
Next Harry stretched out both arms straight and the kittens carefully walked over into his hands
Well I declare
exclaimed Dinah
Jest see dat Snoopy kittycat
If he cant do real reglar circus tricks
And jest to think how he cut up on de cars
Pears like as if he was doin it fer jokes den too
And look at Fluffy
exclaimed Martha as white as Snoop is black
Harry stooped down and let the kittens jump through his hands which is an old but none the less a very pretty trick
With the air of a real master Bert snapped his whip and placed on the table a little piece of board
He rubbed something on each end it was a bit of dried herring but the people didnt know that then Harry put Snoop on one end and Fluffy on the other
Oh a teetertauter
called Freddie unable to restrain his joy any longer
I bet on Snoop
Hes the heaviest
At the sound of Freddies voice Snoop turned around and the move sent Fluffy up the air
Oh
oh
oh
came a chorus from the children but before anybody in the circus had time to interfere off went Fluffy as hard as she could run over the lots home
The next minute Snoop was after her and Harry stood alone in the ring bowing to the tremendous applause
When the laughing had ceased Bert made the next announcement
Ladies and gentlemen he said we will now introduce our famous menagerie
First we have the singing mice
Theyre mine
called Freddie but Nan insisted on him keeping quiet
Now you will hear the mice sing said Bert and as he held up the cage of little mice somebody whistled a funny tune back of the scenes
Good
good
called Mr Bobbsey
Weve got real talent here he added for indeed the boys had put together a fine show
Now you see our aquarium went on Bert as Harry helped him bring forward the table that held the glass tank
Here we have a real sea serpent he said pointing to a good fat chub that flopped around in the water
Let the little ones walk right up and see them Bert said
Form in line and pass in this way
Not only the children went up but grown folks too for they wanted a look into the tank
Now here are our alligators and crocodiles announced Bert pointing his whip at the turtles
And these are sealions he said pointing out Freddies hoptoads
At each announcement everybody laughed but Bert went on as seriously as if he were deaf
In this separate tank he declared we have our boaconstrictors the largest and fiercest in the world
This is the first time one of this specimen has ever been captured alive
Note the dangerous stripe on his back
It was Jacks snakes that came in for this description and the girls were quite afraid of them although they were in a glass jar
Well I declare
said Mrs Burns
If this isnt a sureenough circus
I often paid a halfdollar when I went to see things no better than these
Everybody thought everything was splendid and the boys were well paid for their efforts
Now said Bert here are our crystal fish from the deep sea
These were Toms goldfish
You will notice how bespangled they are
They say this comes from the fish eating the diamonds lost in shipwrecks
What a whopper
called someone back of the scenes whose voice sounded like Torn Masons
Snap
went Berts whip and the boys did not interrupt him again
The last part of our menagerie is the cage of prize butterflies said Bert
These butterflies are rare and scarce and   Hard to catch
remarked someone not on the programme
Now there will be ten minutes intermission the announcer said so all may have time to see everything in the menagerie
After that we will give you the best number of the programme our chariot race
Oh thats going to be Tom
exclaimed Roy
No its Bert said Flossie
Well Jack has our goatwagon said Mildred
I guess therell be a whole lot in the race said Freddie and maybe theyll have firemen
During the intermission August sold a whole big basket of peanuts and the people wanted more
They knew all the money was to go to the freshair camp which was probably the reason they bought so generously
I dont know when I have enjoyed myself so much declared Mrs
Manners fanning herself
I had no idea boys could be so clever
Thats because you only have girls laughed Mrs Bobbsey
Dont you think we ought to give them a treat for working so hard
whispered Mrs Herold to Aunt Sarah
I would be delighted to have them all to dinner she added in her society way for the Herolds were quite rich
That would be very nice Im sure Aunt Sarah replied boys always have good appetites after having a lot of fun
All this time there was plenty of noise back of the scenes and it was evident something big was being prepared
Presently Bert and Harry came out and lowered tile tent flap first making sure all the little sightseers were outside
Theyre comin
exclaimed Freddie clapping his fat hands
Oh Im just so nervous
whispered Flossie
I hope none of the animals will get loose
Now ladies and gentlemen called Tom Mason appearing at the tent if you will just turn round the other way in your seats and face that ring we will give you an exhibition of cowboy life on the plains
CHAPTER XV THE CHARIOT RACE Toms costume was a splendid imitation of a cowboy
He wore tancolored overalls and a jumper the jumper being slashed up at the sides like an Indians coat
On his head was a very broad sombrero this hat having really come from the plains as it belonged to a Western farmer who had lately moved to Meadow Brook
Presently Tom appeared again this time riding the fiery Sable
Hurrah
hurrah
shouted the boys as Tom drove into the ring like a major
Bert now stepped into the middle of the ring alongside of some soap boxes that were piled up there
Now you see ladies and gentlemen began Bert laughing a little at the show in broad daylight you see this the soap boxes is a mail coach
Our cowboy will rob the mail coach from his horse just as they used to do in the mountains of Arizona
Snap went the whip and away went Sable around the ring at a nice even canter
After a few turns around Tom urged his horse on a little until he was going on a steady run
Every one kept quiet for most of Meadow Brook people had heard how Sable had run away some days before
There ought to be music whispered Jack to Harry for indeed the circus was so real it only lacked a brass band
Now Bert put on top of the soap boxes Harrys canvas schoolbag stuffed full of papers
This is the United States mail he said
We will understand that the coach has stopped for a few minutes
Sable was going along splendidly by this time and everybody said what a pretty little horse he was
Hes goin to steal the mail box now
whispered Flossie to Freddie
I hope Sable wont fall or anything
Snap
snap
went the whip as the horse ran faster and faster
All of a sudden Tom got a good tight hold on the reins then he pulled up alongside of the mail coach leaned over grabbed the mail bag and spurred his horse at full speed around the ring
Hurrah
hurrah
shouted everybody
Well done
called Uncle Daniel
Couldnt be better
exclaimed Mr Bobbsey
Tom waved his hat now and patted Sable affectionately as all good riders do when their horses have done well in the ring
The men admired the little horse so much they came up and asked the cowboy a lot of questions about him how old he was and who broke him in
One more number called Bert
The chariot race
At this all took their seats again and out trotted two clowns Jack and August each riding in a little goat wagon
The goats were decorated with the Fourth of July buntings and the wagons had the tailboards out and were tipped up like circus chariots
The clowns pulled up in line
One two three
called Bert with a really big revolver up in the air
Ready
Set
Go
Bang
went the revolver a blank cartridge of course and away started the chariots
Jack wore a broad green belt and August had yellow
Jack darted ahead
Go it green
shouted one group of boys
Pass him orange
called another crowd
Now August passed Jack just as they crossed the line
One
called Bert
We will have ten rounds
In the next the wagons kept almost even until just within a few feet of the line then Jack crossed first
Two
called Bert while all the boys shouted for their favorite
In the next three or four turns the riders divided even
Finally the last round was reached and the boys had tied that is both were even when the round started
This of course made the race very interesting as both had equal chances of winning
Ill put a dollar on green called Mr Bobbsey
For the freshair fund
Ill put one on orange called Uncle Daniel for the same charity
Then the ladies all wanted to bet but Bert said it was against the rules to allow betting
We will take all the money you want to give us said Bert but we cannot allow betting on the races
All ready
called the ringmaster holding his revolver high in the air again
Bang went the gun
Off went the chariots
My how those little goats did run
Go it green
Go it orange
Shout after shout greeted the riders as they urged their steeds around the ring
Suddenly Jacks chariot crossed in front of August
Foul
called Bert while Jack tried his best to get on his own side again
Back
back
yelled Jack to his horse goat but the little animal was too excited to obey
Finally fat August Stout the funniest clown dashed home first and won the race
Hurrah for Nero
called everybody
Hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
shouted the boys long and loud
The circus was over
The money was counted and there was exactly twentythree dollars to be given the poor children in the Meadow Brook FreshAir Camp
Wasnt that splendid
And to think everybody had such a good time too
Freddie and Roy were allowed to ride home in the goat wagons and they tried to race along the way
A committee of five boys Bert Harry Jack Tom and August took the money over to the freshair camp the next day and the managers said it was a very welcome gift for new coats were needed for some sick children that were expected to come out from the city as soon as provision could be made for them
Somebody dropped a twodollar bill in the ticket box August told his companions
Then there were the other two dollars from the race besides some fiftycent pieces I dont know who gave
Of course we couldnt make all that just on five and tencent seats
And I took in two dollars on the peanuts besides
Well were all satisfied said Harry
And I guess everybody had a good time
Sure they did spoke up Tom and I hope Bert will come out here next year to help us with another big circus
Theyre the best fun we ever had
For some days every boy and girl in Meadow Brook talked about the circus which had really been a greater success than even the boys themselves had expected
It was a warm afternoon quite late in July  one of those days that make a boy feel lazy and inclined to stretch himself
Bert and Harry were down back of the barn sitting on the fresh stack of hay that had just been piled up by John the stableman
Did you ever try smoking
Harry asked Bert suddenly as if he had discovered something new and interesting
No
answered Bert in surprise
Father wouldnt let me smoke
Neither would pa said Harry but I suppose every fellow has to try it some time
Ive seen them make cigarettes out of corn silk
I suppose that is not as bad as tobacco replied Bert
No answered Harry theres no harm in corn silk
Guess Ill try to roll a cigarette
At this Harry slid down off the hay and pulled from the fast withering corn some dry silk
With a good handful he went back to Bert
Ive got some soft paper he said sitting down again and beginning the task
Bert watched with interest but really had no idea of doing wrong
There
exclaimed Harry giving the ends of the cigarette a twist
How is that
Pretty good answered Bert looks like a real one
Lets try it
went on Harry
Not in the hay exclaimed Bert you might drop the match
At this Harry slid down along the side of the stack and Bert followed
It did seem wrong as soon as Harry struck the match but the cigarette being only corn silk made the boys forget all the warnings never to smoke
Harry gave a puff or two
Then he choked a little
Kinder strong he spluttered
You try it
Bert put the cigarette in his mouth
He drew it once or twice then quickly tossed it aside
Ouch
he exclaimed
Tastes like old shoes
At that time John came up and piled on some more hay
The boys of course had to act as if nothing had happened and dared not look around to find the lighted cigarette even though they wanted to very much
I hope it went out Bert said as John walked away again
If it didnt its under the hay said Harry somewhat alarmed
But I guess its out
My look at the storm coming
Bert exclaimed suddenly
We ought to help John with that load of hay
All right said Harry come along
and with this the two boys started on a run down through the fields into the open meadow where the dry hay was being packed up ready to put on the hay rick
John of course was very glad of the help for it spoils hay to get it wet so all three worked hard to load up before the heavy shower should come up
All ready
called John and no time to lose
At this the boys jumped up and all started for the barn
Theres smoke
exclaimed Harry in terror as they neared the barn
The barn is afire
screamed John the next minute almost falling from his seat on the wagon in his haste to get down
Quick
quick
yelled the boys so frightened they could hardly move
The hose
called John seeing flames now shoot out of the barn windows Get the hose Harry its in the coach house
Ill get a bucket while you attach the hose
By this time everybody was out from the house
Oh mercy
cried Aunt Sarah
Our whole barn will be burned
Uncle Daniel was with John now pouring water on the flames that were gaining in spite of all efforts to put them out
Wheres the firemen
cried little Freddie in real tears this time for he like all the others was awfully frightened
The boys had a stream from the hose now but this too was of no account for the flames had shot up from the big pile of dry hay
The firemen
called Freddie again
There are no firemen in the country Freddie Nan told him
We have to put the fire out ourselves
We cant then he went on and all the other barns will burn too
There was indeed great danger for the flames were getting ahead rapidly
All this time the terrific thunderstorm was coming up
Clap after clap of thunder rolled over the hills and made the fire look more terrible against the black sky
The rain
exclaimed Uncle Daniel at last The rain may put it out we cant
At this one terrific clap of thunder came
Then the downpour of rain
It came like a very deluge and as it fell on the flames it sent out steam and smoke but quickly subdued the cracking and flashing of the fire
Everybody ran to the back porch now but John and Uncle Daniel
They went in the coach house at the side of the barn
How could it have caught fire
Aunt Sarah said
But Harry and Bert were both very pale and never said a word
How heavily the rain did pour down just like a cloudburst
And as it struck the fire even the smoke began to die out
Its going out
exclaimed Harry
Oh I hope it keeps on raining
Soon there was even no more smoke
Its out
called John a little later
That was a lucky storm for us
CHAPTER XVI THE FLOOD The heavy downpour of rain had ceased now and everybody ran to the barn to see what damage the fire had done
It almost caught my pigeon coop
said Harry as he examined the blackened beams in the barn near the wire cage his birds lived in
The entire back of this barn will have to be rebuilt said Uncle Daniel
John are you sure you didnt drop a match in the hay
Positive sir
answered John
I never use a match while Im working
Didnt even have one in my clothes
Bert whispered something to Harry
It was too much to have John blamed for their wrongdoing
Father
said Harry bravely but with tears in his eyes
It was our fault we set the barn afire
What
exclaimed Uncle Daniel in surprise
You boys set the barn afire
Yes spoke up Bert
It was mostly my fault
I threw the cigarette away and we couldnt find it
Cigarette
exclaimed Uncle Daniel
What
 you boys smoking
Both Bert and Harry started to cry
They were not used to being spoken to like that and of course they realized how much it cost to put that nasty old cigarette in their mouths
Besides there might have been a great deal more damage if it hadnt been for the rain
Come with me
Uncle Daniel said we must find out how all this happened and he led the unhappy boys into the coach house where they all sat down on a bench
Now Harry stop your crying and tell me about it the father commanded
Harry tried to obey but his tears choked him
Bert was the first able to speak
Oh Uncle Daniel he cried we really didnt mean to smoke
We only rolled up some corn silk in a piece of paper and   His tears choked back his words now and Harry said It was I who rolled the cigarette father and it was awful it almost made us sick
Then when Bert put it in his mouth   I threw it away and it must have fallen in the hay
said Bert
Why didnt you come and tell me
questioned Uncle Daniel severely
It was bad enough to do all that but worse to take the risk of fire
Well the storm was coming Harry answered and we went to help John with the hay
Now boys said Uncle Daniel this has been a very serious lesson to you and one which you will remember ail your lives
I need not punish you any more you have suffered enough from the fright of that awful fire
And if it hadnt been that you were always pretty good boys the Lord would not have sent that shower to save us as He did
I bet Ill never smoke again as long as 1 live said Harry determinedly through hid sic tears
Neither will I Bert said firmly and Ill try to make other fellows stop if I can
All right answered Uncle Daniel Im sure you mean that and dont forget to thank the Lord tonight for helping us as He did
And you must ask His pardon too for doing wrong remember
This ended the boys confession but they could not stop crying for a long time and Bert felt so sick and nervous he went to bed without eating any supper
Uncle Daniel gave orders that no one should refer to the fire or cause the boys any more worry as they were both really very nervous from the shock so that beyond helping John clear things up in the burned end of the barn there was no further reference to the boys accident
Next day it rained very hard  in fact it was one of those storms that come every summer and do not seem to know when to go away
The gate at the sawmill dam is closed Harry told Bert and if the pond gets any higher they wont be able to cross the plank to open up the gate and let the water out
That would be dangerous wouldnt it
Bert asked
Very replied Harry
Peter Burns house is right in line with the dam at the other side of the plank and if the dam should ever burst that house would be swept away
And the barn and henhouse are nearer the pond than the house even
Bert remarked
It would be an awful loss for a poor man
Lets go up in the attic and see how high the pond is Harry suggested
From the top of the house the boys could see across the high pond bank into the water
My
Bert exclaimed isnt it awful
Yes it is Harry replied
You see all the streams from the mountains wash into this pond and in a big storm like this it gets very dangerous
Why do they build houses in such dangerous places
asked Bert
Oh you see that house of Burns has stood there maybe one hundred years  long before any dam was put in the pond to work the sawmill said Harry
Oh thats it  is it
Bert replied
I thought it was queer to put houses right in line with a dam
See how strong the water is getting went on Harry
Look at that big log floating down
It will be fun when it stops raining remarked Bert
We can sail things almost anywhere
Yes Ive seen the pond come right up across the road down at Hopkins once Harry told his cousins
That was when it had rained a whole week without stopping
Say called Dinah from the foot of the stairs
You boys up there better get your boots on and look after that Frisky cow
Johns gone off somewhere and dat calf am crying herself sick out in de barn
Maybe she a gettin drownded
It did not take long to get their boots and overcoats on and hurry out to the barn
Sure enough she is getting drownded
exclaimed Harry as they saw the poor little calf standing in water up to her knees
Where is all the water coming from
sked Bert
I dont know Harry answered unless the tank upstairs has overflowed
The boys ran up the stairs and found just as Harry thought the tank that supplied all the barns with water and which also gave a supply for the house to be used on the lawn was flowing over
Is there any way of letting it out
asked Bert quite frightened
We can open all the faucets besides dipping out pailfuls said Harry
But I wish John would get back
Harry ran to get the big water pail while Bert turned on the faucet at the outside of the barn the one in the horse stable another that supplied water for the chickens and ducks and the one John used for carriage washing
Frisky of course had been moved to a dry corner and now stopped crying
Harry gathered all the large water pails he could carry and hurried up to the tank followed by Bert
It has gone down already said Harry as they looked into the tank again
But we had better dip out all we can to make sure
Lucky we found it as soon as we did for there are all fathers tools on the bench right under the tank besides all those new paints that have just been opened
Here comes John now said Bert as he heard the barn door open and shut again
Come up here John
called Harry were almost flooded out
The tank overflowed
It did
exclaimed John
Gracious
I hope nothing is spoiled
Oh we just caught it in tine Harry told him and we opened up the faucets as soon as we could
Then we began dipping out to make sure
You were smart boys this time John told him and saved a lot of trouble by being so prompt to act
There is going to be a flood sure
The dam is roaring like Niagara and they havent opened the gates yet
Im glad we are up high Bert remarked for he had never seen a country flood before and was a good deal frightened at the prospect
Hey John
called Freddie from the back porch
Hey bring me some more nails will you
I need them for my ark
Hes building an ark
laughed Bert
Guess well need it all right if this keeps on
Harry got some nails from his toolbox in the carriage house and the boys went up to the house
There they found Freddie on the hard cement cellar floor nailing boards together as fast as his little hammer could drive the nails in
Hows that
asked the little fellow standing up the raft
I guess that will float said Bert and when it stops raining we can try it
Im going to make a regular ark like the play one Ive got home said Freddie only mine will be a big one with room for us all besides Frisky Snoop Fluffy and   Old Bill
Well need a horse to tow us back when the water goes down laughed Harry
Freddie went on working as seriously as if he really expected to be a little Noah and save all the people from the flood
My but it does rain
exclaimed somebody on the front porch
It was Uncle Daniel who had just returned from the village soaking wet
They cant open the gates Uncle Daniel told Aunt Sarah
They let the water get so high the planks sailed away and now they cant get near the dam
That is bad for the poor Burns family
exclaimed Aunt Sarah
I had better have John drive me down and see if they need anything
I stopped in on my way up Uncle Daniel told her and they were about ready to move out
Well bring them up here if it gets any worse
Why dont they go to the gates in a boat
asked Bert
Why my dear boy said Uncle Daniel anybody who would go near that torrent in a boat might as well jump off the bridge
The falls are twenty five feet high and the water seems to have built them up twice that
If one went within two hundred feet of the dam the surging water would carry him over
You see said Harry explaining it further there is like a window in the falls a long low door
When this is opened the water is drawn down under and does not all have to go over the falls
And if there is too much pressure against the stone wall that makes the dam the wall may be carried away
Thats what we call the dam bursting finished Uncle Daniel
All this was very interesting to Bert who could not help being frightened at the situation
The boys told Uncle Daniel how the tank in the barn had overflowed and he said they had done good work to prevent any damage
Oh Uncle Daniel
exclaimed Freddie just then running up from the cellar
Come and see my ark
Its most done and Im going to put all the animals and things in it to save them from the flood
An ark
exclaimed his uncle laughing
Well youre a sensible little fellow to build an ark today Freddie for we will surely need one if this keeps up and away they went to examine the raft Freddie had actually nailed together in the cellar
That was an awful night in Meadow Brook and few people went to bed staying up instead to watch the danger of the flood
The men took turns walking along the pond bank all night long and their low call each hour seemed to strike terror in the hearts of those who were in danger
The men carried lanterns and the little specks of light were all that could be seen through the darkness
Mrs Burns had refused to leave her home
I will stay as long as I can she told Uncle Daniel
I have lived here many a year and that dam has not broken yet so Im not going to give up hope now
But you could hardly get out in time should it break insisted Uncle Daniel and you know we have plenty of room and you are welcome with us
Still she insisted on staying and each hour when the watchman would call from the pond bank just like they used to do in old wartimes Two oclock  and  all is  well
Mrs Burns would look up and say Dear Lord I thank Thee
Peter of course was out with the men
He could not move his barns and chicken house but he had taken his cow and horse to places of safety
There were other families along the road in danger as well as the Burnses but they were not so near the dam and would get some warning to escape before the flood could reach them should the dam burst
How the water roared
And how awfully dark it was
Would morning ever come
Four oclock  the water rises
shouted the men from the bank
Here Mary
called Peter Burns at the door of their little home you put your shawl on and run up the road as fast as you can
Dont wait to take anything but go
Oh my babies pictures
she cried
My dear babies
I must have them
The poor frightened little woman rushed about the house looking for the muchprized pictures of her babies that were in heaven
Its a good thing they all have a safe home tonight she thought for their mother could not give them safety if they were here
Come Mary
called Peter outside
That dam is swaying like a treetop and it will go over any minute
With one last look at the little home Mrs Burns went out and closed the door
Outside there were people from all along the road
Some driven out of their homes in alarm others having turned out to help their neighbors
The watchmen had left the bank
A torrent from the dam would surely wash that away and brave as the men were they could not watch the flood any longer
Get past the willows quick
called the men
Let everybody who is not needed hurry up the road
Mr Mason Mr Hopkins Uncle Daniel and John besides Peter Burns were the men most active in the lifesaving work
There were not many boats to be had but what there were had been brought inland early in the day for otherwise they would have been washed away long before down the stream into the river
What sic that
called Uncle Daniel as there was a heavy crash over near the gates
Then everybody listened breathless
It was just coming daylight and the first streak of dawn saw the end of the awful rain
Not one man in the crowd dared to run up that pond bank and look over the gates
Its pretty strong
said the watchman
I expected to hear it crash an hour ago
There was another crash
There she goes
said Mr Burns and then nobody spoke
CHAPTER XVII A TOWN AFLOAT Is she going
asked Uncle Daniel at last after a wait of several minutes
Daylight was there now and was ever dawn more welcome in Meadow Brook
Ill go up to the pipes volunteered John
And I can see from there
Now the pipes were great water conduits the immense black iron kind that are used for carrying water into cities from reservoirs
They were situated quite a way from the dam but as it was daylight John could see the gates as he stood on the pipes that crossed above the pond
Usually boys could walk across these pipes in safety as they were far above the water but the flood had raised the stream so that the water just reached the pipes and John had to be careful
Whats that
he said as he looked down the raging stream
Something lies across the dam
he shouted to the anxious listeners
This was enough
In another minute every man was on the pond bank
The big elm
they shouted
It has saved the dam
What a wonderful thing had happened
The giant elm tree that for so many many years had stood on the edge of the stream was in this great flood washed away and as it crossed the dam it broke the force of the torrent really making another waterfall
It is safe now
exclaimed Uncle Daniel in surprise
It was the tree we heard crash against the bank
The storm is broken at last and that tree will hold where it is stuck until the force goes down
Then we can open the gates
To think that the houses were safe again
That poor Mrs Burns could come back to the old mill home once more
We must never have this risk again said Mr Mason to Uncle Daniel
When the water goes down we will open the gates then the next dry spell that comes when there is little water in the pond we will break that dam and let the water run through in a stream
If the mill people want water power they will have to get it some place where it will not endanger lives
Uncle Daniel agreed with Mr Mason and as they were both town officials it was quite likely what they said would be done in Meadow Brook
Hey Bert and Harry
called Tom Mason as he and Jack Hopkins ran past the Bobbsey place on their way to see the dam
Come on down and see the flood
The boys did not wait for breakfast but with a buttered roll in hand Harry and Bert joined the others and hurried off to the flood
Did the dam burst
was the first question everybody asked along the way and when told how the elm tree had saved it the people were greatly astonished
Look at this called Tom as they came to a turn in the road where the pond ran level with the fields
That was where it was only stream and no embankment had been built around it
Look
exclaimed Jack the water has come up clear across the road and we can only pass by walking on the high board fence
Or get a boat said Tom
Lets go back to the turn and see if theres a boat tied anywhere
Heres Herolds called Harry as they found the pretty little rowboat used for pleasure by the summer cottagers tied up to a tree
Well just borrow that said Jack and then the four boys lifted the boat to that part of the road where the water ran
All get in and Ill push off said Harry who had hipboots on
The other three climbed in then Harry gave a good push and scrambled over the edge himself
Think of rowing a boat in the middle of a street said Bert
Thats the way they do in Naples he added but I never expected to see such a thing in Meadow Brook
The boys pushed along quite easily as the water was deep enough to use oars in and soon they had rounded the curve of the road and were in sight of the people looking at the dam
What an immense tree
exclaimed Bert as they left their boat and mounted the bank
Thats what saved the dam
said Harry
Now Mrs Burns can come back home again
But look there
called Tom
There goes Peter Burns chicken house
Sure enough the henhouse had left its foundation and now toppled over into the stream
It had been built below the falls near the Burns house and Peter had some valuable ducks and chickens in it
The chickens
called Jack as they ran along
Get the boat Harry and we can save some
The boys were dashing out now right in the stream Jack and Tom being good oarsmen
But the poor chickens
What an awful noise they made as they tried to keep on the dry side of the floating house
The ducks of course didnt mind it but they added their queer quacking to the noise
We can never catch any of the chickens said Harry
We ought to have a rope and pull the house in
A rope called Tom to the crowd on the shore
Throw us a rope
Someone ran off and got one and it was quickly thrown out to the boys in the boat
Push up closer Tom told Harry and Bert who had the oars now
Tom made a big loop on the rope and threw it toward the house
But it only landed over a chicken and caused the frightened fowl to fly high up in the air and rest in a tree on the bank
Good
cried the people on the edge
One is safe anyhow
Tom threw the rope again
This time it caught on a corner of the henhouse and as he pulled the knot tight they had the floating house secure
Hurrah
hurrah
shouted the people
By this time Mr Mason and Uncle Daniel had reached the spot in their boat
Dont pull too hard
called the men to the boys
Youll upset your boat
Throw the line to us added Uncle Daniel This the boys did and as it was a long stretch of rope the men were able to get all the way in to shore with it before pulling at the house
Now well have a tug of war said Mr Mason
Wait for us
cried the boys in the boat We want to have a pull at that
All this time the chickens were cackling and screeching as the house in the water lunged from one side to the other
It was a large new coop and built of strong material that made it very heavy
Now said Uncle Daniel as the boys reached the shore and secured their boat all take a good hold
Every inch of the rope that crossed the waters edge was soon covered with somebodys hand
All pull now
called Mr Mason and with a jerk in came the floating house chickens ducks and all and down went everybody that had pulled
The force of the jerk of course threw them all to the ground but that was only fun and gave the boys a good chance to laugh
Just as soon as the chickens reached the shore they scampered for home  some flying some running but all making a noise
We may as well finish the job said Mr Mason
Tom go hitch Sable up to the cart and well bring the henhouse back where it belongs
By running across the fields that were on the highest part of the road Tom was able to get to his barn without a boat and soon he returned with the cart and Sable
It took all hands to get the henhouse on the cart but this was finally done and away went Sable up the road with the queer load after him in the dump cart
You had better put it up on the hill this time Peter told them
The water isnt gone down yet
So at last the chicken coop was settled and not a hen was missing
There were many sights to be seen about Meadow Brook that afternoon and the boys enjoyed the flood now that there was no longer any danger to life
Bert caught a big salmon and a blackspotted lizard that had been flooded out from some dark place in the mountains Harry found a pretty toy canoe that some smal1 boy had probably been playing with in the stream before the water rose and Jack was kept busy towing in all kinds of stuff that had broken loose from barns along the pond
Freddie had boots on and was happy sailing his ark up and down the road
He insisted on Snoop taking a ride but cats do not fancy water and the black kitten quickly hid himself up in the hay loft out of Freddies reach
Little by little the water fell until by the next afternoon there was no longer a river running through the roads
But there were plenty of wet places and enough of streams washing down the rain the gutters to give Freddie a fine canal to sail boats in
Nan and Flossie had boats too which Bert and Harry made for them
In fact all the girls along Meadow Brook road found something that would sail while the flood days lasted
As it was still July the hot sun came down and dried things up pretty quickly but many haymows were completely spoiled as were summer vegetables that were too near the pond and came in for their share of the washout
This loss however was nothing compared with what had been expected by the farmers and all were satisfied that a kind Providence had saved the valley houses from complete destruction
CHAPTER XVIII THE FRESHAIR CAMP Quiet had settled down once more upon the little village of Meadow Brook
The excitement of the flood had died away and now when the month of July was almost gone and a good part of vacation had gone with it the children turned their attention to a matter of new interest  the freshair camp
Mildred Manners was over to the camp yesterday Nan told her mother and she says whole lot of little girls have come out from the city and they have such poor clothes
There is no sickness there that anyone could catch she says for her uncle is the doctor you know but Mildred says her mother is going to show her how to make some aprons for the little girls
Why that would be nice for all you little girls to do said Mrs Bobbsey
Suppose you start a sewing school and all see what you can make
Oh that would be lovely
exclaimed Nan
When can we start
As soon as we get the materials the mother replied
We will ask Aunt Sarah to drive over to the camp this afternoon then we can see what the children need
Can I go
asked Flossie much interested in the freshair work
I guess so said Mrs Bobbsey
If we take the depot wagon there will be room for you and Freddie
So that was how it came about that our little friends became interested in the freshair camp
Nan and Mildred Flossie and Freddie with Aunt Sarah and Mrs Bobbsey visited the camp in the afternoon
What a queer place it is
whispered Flossie as they drove up to the tents on the mountainside
Hush said Nan they might hear you
Oh these are warcamps
exclaimed Freddie when he saw the white tents
Theyre just like the warpictures in my story book
The matron who had charge of the camp came up and when Mrs Bobbsey explained her business the matron was pleased and glad to show them through the place
Oh it was your boys who brought us all that money from the circus
said the woman
Thats why we have all the extra children here  the circus money has paid for them and they are to have two weeks on this beautiful mountain
Im glad the boys were able to help said Mrs Bobbsey
It really was quite a circus
It must have been when they made so much money the other answered
And we are going to help now spoke up Nan
We are starting a sewing school
Oh Im so glad somebody has thought of clothes said the matron
We often get gifts of food but we need clothes so badly
There is no sickness
asked Mrs Bobbsey as they started on a tour of the camp
No we cannot take sick children here now said the matron
We had some early in the season but this is such a fine place for romping we decided to keep this camp for the healthy children and have another for those who are sick
By this time numbers of little girls and boys crowded around the visitors
They were quite different from the children of Meadow Brook or Lakeport
Somehow they were smaller but looked older
Poor children begin to worry so young that they soon look much older than they really are
Nan and Mildred spoke kindly to the girls while Freddie and Flossie soon made friends with the little boys
One small boy smaller than Freddie with sandy hair and beautiful blue eyes was particularly happy with Freddie
He looked better than the others was almost as fat as Freddie and he had such lovely clear skin as if somebody loved to wash it
Where do you lib
he lisped to Freddie
At Uncle Daniels Freddie answered
Where do you live
With mamma replied the little boy
Then he stopped a minute
Oh no I dont live with mamma now he corrected himself cause shes gone to heaven so I live with Mrs
Manily
Mrs Manily was the matron and numbers of the children called her mamma
Can I come over and play with you
asked the boy
Whats your name
His name is Freddie and mine is Flossie said the latter
What is your name
Mine is Edward Brooks said the little stranger but everybody calls me Sandy
Do you like Sandy better than Edward
No replied Flossie
But I suppose thats a pet name because your hair is that color
Is it
said the boy tossing his sunny curls around
Maybe thats why
Guess it is said Freddie
But will Mrs Man let you come over to our house
Mrs Manily you mean said Sandy
Ill just go and ask her
Isnt he cute
exclaimed Flossie and the pretty little boy ran in search of Mrs Manily
Im going to ask mamma if we can bring him home declared Freddie
He could sleep in my bed
The others of the party were now walking through the big tents
This is where we eat the matron explained as the dining room was entered
The tent was filled with long narrow tables and had benches at the sides
The tables were covered with oilcloth and in the center of each was a beautiful bunch of fresh wild flowers  the small pretty kind that grow in the woods
You ought to see our poor children eat remarked the matron
We have just as much as we can do to serve them they have such good appetites from the country air
We must send you some fresh vegetables said Aunt Sarah and some fruit for Sunday
We would be very grateful replied Mrs Manily for of course we cannot afford much of a variety
Next to the dining room was the dormitory or sleeping tent
We have a little boys brigade said the matron and every pleasant evening they march around with drums and tin fifes
Then when it is bedtime we have a boy blow the taps on a tin bugle just like real soldiers do
Freddie and Sandy had joined the sightseers now and Freddie was much interested in the brigade
Who is the captain
he asked of Mrs Manily
Oh we appoint a new captain each week from the very best boys we have
We only let a very good boy be captain the matron told him
In the dormitory were rows and rows of small white cots
They looked very clean and comfortable and the door of this tent was closed with a big green mosquito netting
How old are your babies
asked Aunt Sarah
Sandy is our baby
replied the matrons patting the little boy fondly and he is four years old
We cannot take them any younger without their mothers
Freddie is four also said Mrs Bobbsey
What a dear sweet child Sandy is
Yes said Mrs Manily he has just lost a good mother and his father cannot care for him  that is he cannot afford to pay his board or hire a housekeeper so he brought him to the Aid Society
He is the pet of the camp and you can see he has been well trained
No mother and no home
exclaimed Mrs Bobbsey
Dear little fellow
Think of our Freddie being alone in the world like that
Mrs Bobbsey could hardly keep her tears back
She stooped over and kissed Sandy
Do you know my mamma
he asked looking straight into the ladys kind face
Mrs Manily is your mamma isnt she
said Mrs Bobbsey
Yes shes my number two mamma but I mean number one that used to sleep with me
Come now Sandy laughed Mrs Manily
Didnt you tell me last night I was the best mamma in the whole world
and she hugged the little fellow to make him happy again
So you are he laughed forgetting all his loneliness now
When I get to be a big man Im goin to take you out carriage riding
Cant Sandy cone home with us
asked Freddie
He can sleep in my bed
You are very good said the matron
But we cannot let any of our children go visiting without special permission from the Society
Well said Aunt Sarah if you get the permission we will be very glad to have Sandy pay us a visit
We have a large place and would really like to have some good poor child enjoy it
We have company now but they will leave us soon and then perhaps we could have a little freshair camp of our own
The managers have asked us to look for a few private homes that could accommodate some special cases replied Mrs Manily and I am sure I can arrange it to have Sandy go
Oh let him come now pleaded Freddie as Sandy held tight to his hand
See we have room in the wagon
Well he might have a ride consented the matron and before anyone had a chance to speak again Freddie and Sandy had climbed into the wagon
Nan and Mildred had been talking to some of the older girls who were very nice and polite for girls who had no one to teach them at home and Nan declared that she was coming over to the camp to play with them some whole day
We can bring our lunch said Mildred and you can show us all the pleasant playplaces you have fixed up in stones over the mountainside
One girl Nellie by name seemed very smart and bright and she brought to Mrs Bobbsey a bunch of ferns and wild flowers she had just gathered while showing Nan and Mildred around
You certainly have a lovely place here said Mrs Bobbsey as they got ready to leave and you little girls will be quite strong and ready for school again when you go back to the city
I dont go to school said Nellie rather bashfully
Why
asked Aunt Sarah
Oh I go to night school said the little girl
But in the daytime I have to work
Why how old are you
asked Aunt Sarah
Twelve said Nellie shyly
Working at twelve years of age
exclaimed Mrs Bobbsey in surprise
What do you do
Im a cashgirl in a big store said Nellie with some pride for many little girls are not smart enough to hold such a position
I thought all children had to go to school Aunt Sarah said to Mrs Manily
So they do replied the matron but in special cases they get permission from the factory inspector
Then they can work during the day and go to school at night
I think its a shame
said the mother
That child is not much larger than Nan and to think of her working in a big store all day then having to work at night school too
It does not seem right
admitted the matron but you see sometimes there is no choice
Either a child must work or go to an institution and we strain every point to keep them in their homes
We will drive back with Sandy said Aunt Sarah as they got into the wagon
Cant Nellie come too
asked Nan
There is plenty of room
The matron said yes and so the little party started off for a ride along the pretty road
I was never in a carriage before in all my life said Nellie suddenly
Isnt it grand
Never
exclaimed the other girls in surprise
No said Nellie
Ive had lots of rides in trolley cars and we had a ride in a farm wagon the other day but this is the first time I have ever been in a carriage
Aunt Sarah was letting Sandy drive and he of course was delighted
Freddie enjoyed it almost as well as Sandy did and kept telling him which rein to pull on and all that
Old Bill the horse knew the road so well he really didnt need any driver but he went along very nicely with the two little boys talking to him
We will stop and have some soda at the postoffice said Mrs Bobbsey
For the postoffice was also a general store
This was good news to everybody and when the man came out for the order Aunt Sarah told him to bring cakes too
Everybody liked the ice cream soda but it was plain Nellie and Sandy had not had such a treat in a long time
This is the best fun Ive had
declared the little cashgirl allowing how grateful she was
And I hope youll come and see us again she added politely to Mildred and Nan
Oh we intend to said Mildred
You know we are going to have a sewing school to make aprons for the little ones at the camp
Old Bill had turned back to the freshair quarters again and soon too soon Sandy was handed back to Mrs Manily while Nellie jumped down and said what a lovely time she had had
Now be sure to come Sandy called Freddie  cause Ill expect you
I will said Sandy rather sadly for he would rather have gone along right then
And Ill let you play with Snoop and my playthings Freddie called again
Goode bye
Goodbye answered the little fresh children
Then old Bill took the others home
CHAPTER XIX SEWING SCHOOL Lets get Mabel and all the others said Nan to Mildred
We ought to take at least six gingham aprons and three nightgowns over to the camp
Aunt Sarah had turned a big long attic room into a sewing school where Nan and Mildred had full charge
Flossie was to look after the spools of thread keeping them from tangling up and the girls agreed to let Freddie cut paper patterns
This was not a play sewing school but a real one for Aunt Sarah and Mrs Bobbsey were to do the operating or machine sewing while the girls were to sew on tapes buttons overhand seams and do all that
Mildred and Nan invited Mabel Nettle Marie Brenn she was visiting the Herolds Bessie and Anna Thomas a big girl who lived over Lakeside way
Be sure to bring your thimbles and needles Nan told them
And come at two oclock this afternoon
Every girl came  even Nettie who was always so busy at home
Mrs Bobbsey sat at the machine ready to do stitching while Aunt Sarah was busy cutting out on a long table in front of the low window
Now young ladies said Mrs Bobbsey we have ready some blue gingham aprons
You see how they are cut out two seams one at each side then they are to be closed down the back
There will be a pair of strings on each apron and you may begin by pressing down a narrow hem on these strings
We will not need to baste them just press them down with the finger this way
Mrs Bobbsey then took up a pair of the sashes and turned in the edges
Immediately the girls followed her instructions and very soon all of the strings were ready for the machine
Nan handed them to her mother and then Aunt Sarah gave out the work
Now these are the sleeves said Aunt Sarah and they must each have little gathers brought in at the elbow here between these notches
Next you place the sleeve together notch to notch and they can be stitched without basting
Isnt it lively to work this way
said Mildred
It isnt a bit of trouble and see how quickly we get done
Many hands make light work replied Mrs Bobbsey
I guess we will get all the aprons finished this afternoon
Piece by piece the various parts of the garments were given out until there remained nothing more to do than to put on buttons and work buttonholes and overhand the arm holes
Ill cut the buttonholes said Mrs Bobbsey then Nan and Mildred may work the buttonholes by sticking a pin through each hole
The other girls may then sew the buttons on
It was wonderful how quickly those little pearl buttons went down the backs of the aprons
I believe I could make an apron all alone now said Nan if it was cut out
So could I declared Mildred
It isnt hard at all
Well heres my patterns spoke up Freddie who with Flossie had been busy over in the corner cutting ladies out of a fashion paper
No theyre paper dolls said Flossie who was standing them all up in a row and we are going to give them to the freshair children to play with on rainy days
It was only halfpast four when Nan rang the bell to dismiss the sewing school
We have had such a lovely time said Mabel we would like to have sewing to do every week
Well you are welcome to come said Aunt Sarah
We will make night dresses for the poor little ones next week then after that you might all bring your own work mending fancywork or tidies whatever you have to do
And we might each pay five cents to sew for the freshair children suggested Mildred
Yes all charity sewing classes have a fund Mrs Bobbsey remarked
That would be a good idea
Now let us fold up the aprons said Nan
Dont they look pretty
And indeed the halfdozen blueandwhite ginghams did look very nice for they were carefully made and all smooth and even
When can we iron them out
asked Flossie anxious to deliver the gifts to the needy little ones
Tomorrow afternoon replied her mother
The boys are going to pick vegetables in the morning and we will drive over in the afternoon
Uncle Daniel had given the boys permission to pick all the butterbeans and stringbeans that were ripe besides three dozen ears of the choicest corn called Country Gentleman
Children can only eat very tender corn said Uncle Daniel and as that is sweet and milky they will have no trouble digesting it
Harry looked over every ear of the green corn by pulling the husks down and any that seemed a bit overripe he discarded
We will have to take the long wagon said Bert as they began to count up the baskets
There were two of beans three of corn one of lettuce two of sweet apples besides five bunches of Freddies radishes
Be sure to bring Sandy back with you called Freddie who did not go to the camp this time
Tell him Ill let him be my twin brother
Nan and Aunt Sarah went with the boys but how disappointed they were to find a strange matron in charge of the camp and Sandys eyes red from crying after Mrs Manily
Oh I knowed you would come to take me to Freddie cried he cause my other mamma is gone too and Im all alone
Mrs Manily was called away by sickness in her family explained the new matron and I cannot do anything with this little boy
He was so fond of Mrs Manily said Aunt Sarah and besides he remembers how lonely he was when his own mother went away
Maybe we could bring him over to our house for a few days
Yes Mrs Manily spoke of that said the matron and she had received permission from the Society to let Edward pay a visit to Mrs Daniel Bobbsey
See here is the card
Oh that will be lovely
cried Nan hugging Sandy as tight as her arms could squeeze
Freddie told us to be sure to bring you back with us
I am so glad to get these things the matron said to Aunt Sarah as she took the aprons for everybody has been upset with Mrs Manily having to leave so suddenly
The aprons are lovely
Did the little girls make them
Aunt Sarah told her about the sewing school and then she said she was going to have a little account printed about it in the years report of good work done for the Aid Society
And Mrs Manily has written an account of your circus the matron told Harry and Bert for she had heard about the boys and their successful charity work
Some of the girls who knew Nan came up now and told her how Nellie the little cashgirl had been taken sick and had had to be removed to the hospital tent over in the other mountain
This was sad news to Nan for she loved the little cashgirl and hoped to see her and perhaps have her pay a visit to Aunt Sarahs
Is she very sick
Aunt Sarah asked the matron
Yes indeed the other replied
But the doctor will soon cure her I think
The child is too young to work so hard Aunt Sarah declared
It is no wonder her health breaks down at the slightest cause when she has no strength laid away to fight sickness
By this time a big girl had washed and dressed Sandy and now what a pretty boy he was
He wore a blueandwhitestriped linen suit and had a jaunty little white cap just like Freddies
He was so anxious to go that he jumped in the wagon before the others were ready to start
Get app Bill
he called grabbing at the reins and off the old horse started with no one in the wagon but Sandy
Sandy had given the reins such a jerk that Bill started to run and the more the little boy tried to stop him the harder he went
Dont slap him with the reins
called Harry who was now running down the hill as hard as he could after the wagon
Pull on the reins
he called again
But Sandy was so excited he kept slapping the straps up and down on poor Bill which to the horse of course meant to go faster
Hell drive in the brook called Bert in alarm also rushing after the runaway
Whoa Bill
whoa Bill
called everybody the children from the camp having now joined in following the wagon
The brook was directly in front of Sandy
Quick Harry
yelled Bert
Youll get him in a minute
It was no easy matter however to overtake Sandy for the horse had been on a run from the start
But Sandy kept his seat well and even seemed to think it good fun now to have everybody running after him and no one able to catch him
Oh Im so afraid hell go in the pond
Nan told Aunt Sarah almost in tears
Bill would sit down first declared Aunt Sarah who knew her horse to be an intelligent animal
Oh
oh
oh
screamed everybody for the horse had crossed from the road into the little field that lay next the water
Whoa Bill
shouted Aunt Sarah at the top of her voice and instantly the horse stood still
The next minute both Bert and Harry were in the wagon beside Sandy
Cant I drive
asked the little fellow innocently while Harry was backing out of the swamp
You certainly made Bill go Harry admitted all out of breath from running
And you gave us a good run too added Bert who was red in the face from his violent exercise
Bill knew ma meant it when she said whoa
Harry remarked to Bert
I tell you he stopped just in time for a few feet further would have sunk horse wagon and all in the swamp
Of course it was all an accident for Sandy had no idea of starting the horse off so no one blamed him when they got back to the road
Well all get in this time laughed Aunt Sarah to the matron
And Ill send the boys over Sunday to let you know how Sandy is
Oh he will be all right with Freddie
Bert said patting the little stranger on the shoulders
We will take good care of him
It was a pleasant ride back to the Bobbsey farm and all enjoyed it  especially Sandy who had gotten the idea he was a firstclass driver and knew all about horses old Bill in particular
Hurrah
hurrah
shouted Freddie when the wagon turned in the drive
I knowed you would come Sandy
and the next minute the two little boys were hand in hand running up to the barn to see Frisky Snoop the chickens ducks pigeons and everything at once
Sandy was a little city boy and knew nothing about real live country life so that everything seemed quite wonderful to him especially the chickens and ducks
He was rather afraid of anything as big as Frisky
Snoop and Fluffy were put through their circus tricks for the strangers benefit and then Freddie let Sandy turn on his trapeze up under the apple tree and showed him all the different kinds of turns Bert and Harry had taught the younger twin how to perform on the swing
How long can you stay
Freddie asked his little friend while they were swinging
I dont know Sandy replied vaguely
Maybe you could go to the seashore with us Freddie ventured
We are only going to stay in the country this month
Maybe I could go lisped Sandy cause nobody aint got charge of me now
Mrs Manily has gone away you know and I dont blieve in the other lady do you
Freddie did not quite understand this but he said no just to agree with Sandy
And you know the big girl Nellie who always curled my hair without pulling it  shes gone away too so maybe Im your brother now went on the little orphan
Course you are
spoke up Freddie manfully throwing his arms around the other Youre my twin brother too cause thats the realest kind
We are all twins you know  Nan and Bert and Flossie and me and you
By this time the other Bobbseys had come out to welcome Sandy
They thought it best to let Freddie entertain him at first so that he would not be strange but now Uncle Daniel just took the little fellow up in his arms and into his heart for all good men love boys especially when they are such real little men as Sandy and Freddie happened to be
Hes my twin brother Uncle Daniel Freddie insisted
Dont you think hes just like me curls and all
He is certainly a fine little chap
the uncle replied meaning every word of it and he is quite some like you too
Now let us feed the chickens
See how they are around us expecting something to eat
The fowls were almost ready to eat the pearl buttons off Sandys coat so eager were they for their meal and it was great fun for the two little boys to toss the corn to them
Granny will eat from your hand exclaimed Uncle Daniel You see she is just like granitegray stone but we call her Granny for short
The Plymouth Rock hen came up to Sandy and much to his delight ate the corn out of his little white hand
Oh shes a pretty chicken
he said stroking Granny as he would a kitten
I dust love chitens he added sitting right down on the sandy ground to let Granny come up on his lap
There was so much to see in the poultry yard that Sandy Freddie and Uncle Daniel lingered there until Martha appeared at the back door and rang the big dinner bell in a way that meant Hurry up
something will get cold if you dont
And the something proved to be chicken potpie with dumplings that everybody loves
And after that there came apple pudding with hard sauce just full of sugar
Is it a party
Sandy whispered to Freddie for he was not accustomed to more than bread and milk at his evening meal
Yes I guess so ventured Freddie its because you came and then Dinah brought in little play cups of chocolate with jumbles on the side and Mrs Bobbsey said that would be better than the pudding for Freddie and Sandy
I guess Ill just live here solemnly said the little stranger as if his decision in such a matter should not be questioned
I guess you better
Freddie agreed cause its nicer than over there isnt it
Lots replied Sandy only maybe Mrs Manily will cry for me and he looked sad as his big blue eyes turned around and blinked to keep back some tears
I dust love Mrs Manily Freddie dont you
he asked wistfully
Then Harry and Bert jumped up to start the phonograph and that was like a band wagon to the little fellows who liked to hear the popular tunes called off by the funny man in the big bright horn
CHAPTER XX A MIDNIGHT SCARE Sometimes Im afraid in the bed tent over there said Sandy to Freddie
Cause there aint nothing to keep the dark out but a piece of veil in the door
Mosquito netting corrected Freddie
I would be afraid to sleep outdoors that way too
Cause maybe theres snakes
There sure is declared the other little fellow cuddling up closer to Freddie
Cause one of the boys Tommy his name is killed two the other day
Well there aint no snakes around here declared Freddie an this bed was put in this room right next to mamas for me so you neednt be scared when Aunt Sarah comes and turns out the lights
Both little boys were very sleepy and in spite of having so many things to tell each other the sandman came around and interrupted them actually making their eyes fall down like porch screens when someone touches the string
Mrs Bobbsey came up and looked in at the door
Two little sunny heads so close together
Why should that little darling be left alone over in the dark tent
she thought
See how happy he is with our own dear son Freddie
Then she tucked them a little bit half closed the door and turned out the hall light
Everybody must have been dreaming for hours it seemed so at any rate when suddenly all were awake again
What was it
What woke up the household with such a start
There it is again
screamed Flossie
Oh mamma mamma come in my room quick
Sandy grabbed hold of Freddie
Were all right whispered the brave little Freddie
Its only the girls thats hollering
Then they both put their curls under the bedquilts
Someones playing the piano Bert said to Harry and sure enough a nocturnal solo was coming up in queer chunks from the parlor
Its a crazy burglar and he never saw a piano before Flossie said
The hall clock just struck midnight
That seemed to make everybody more frightened
Uncle Daniel was hurrying down the stairs now
There it is again whispered Bert as another group of wild chords came from the piano
It must be cats
exclaimed Uncle Daniel
Harry come down here and help light up and well solve this mystery
Without a moments hesitation Bert and Harry were down the stairs and had the hall light burning as quickly as a good match could be struck
But there was no more music and no cats about
Where is Snoop
asked Uncle Daniel
The boys opened the hall door into the cellarway and found there Snoop on his cushion and Fluffy on hers
It wasnt the cats they declared
What could it be
Uncle Daniel even lighted the piano lamp which gave a strong light but there didnt seem to be any disturbance about
It certainly was the piano he said much puzzled
And sounded like a cat serenade ventured Harry
Well she isnt around here laughed Uncle Daniel and we never heard of a ghost in Meadow Brook before
All this time the people upstairs waited anxiously
Flossie held Nan so tightly about the neck that the elder sister could hardly breathe
Freddie and Sandy were still under the bedclothes while Mrs Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah listened in the hall
Dat sure is a ghost whispered Dinah to Martha in the hall above
Ghosts always lub music and her funny big eyes rolled around in that queer way colored people have of expressing themselves
Ghosts nothin replied Martha indignantly
I dusted every key of the piano today and I guess I could smell a ghost about as quick as anybody
Well I dont see that we can do any good by sitting around here remarked Uncle Dan to the boys after the lapse of some minutes
We may as well put out the lights and get into bed again
But I cannot see what it could be
Mrs Bobbsey insisted as they all prepared to retire again
Neither can we
agreed Uncle Daniel
Maybe our piano has one of those selfplaying tricks and somebody wound it up by accident
But no sooner were the lights out and the house quiet than the piano started again
Hush I keep quiet
whispered Uncle Daniel
Ill get it this time whatever it is
With matches in one hand and a candle in the other he started downstairs in the dark without making a sound while the piano kept on playing in chunks as Harry said same as it did before
Once in the parlor Uncle Daniel struck a match and put it to the candle and then the music ceased
There he is
he called and Flossie thought she surely would die
Slam
went the musicbook at something and Sandy almost choked with fear
Bang
went something else that brought Bert and Harry downstairs to help catch the burglar
There he is in the corner
called Uncle Daniel to the boys and then began such a slam banging time that the people upstairs were in terror that the burglar would kill Harry and Bert and Uncle Daniel
Weve got him Weve got him
declared Harry while Bert lighted the lamp
Is he dead
screamed Aunt Sarah from the stairs
As a doornail
answered Harry
What is it
asked Mrs Bobbsey hardly able to speak
A big gray rat replied Uncle Daniel and everybody had a good laugh
I thought it might be that said Mrs Bobbsey
So did I declared Nan
But I wasnt sure
I thought it was a big black burglar Flossie said her voice still shaking from the fright
I thought it was a policeman faltered Sandy
Cause they always bang things like that
And I thought sures yo life it was a real ghost laughed Dinah
Cause de clock jest struck fer de ghost hour
Ha
ha
dat was suah a musicanious rat
He must have come in from the fields where John has been plowing
Like a cat in a strange garret he didnt know what to do in a parlor said Uncle Daniel
Harry took the candle and looked carefully over the keys
Why theres something like seeds on the keys
he said
Oh I have it
exclaimed Bert
Nan left her hat on the piano last night and it has those funny straw flowers on it
See the rat got some of them off and they dropped on the keys
And the other time he came for the cake said Aunt Sarah
Thats it declared Uncle Daniel and each time we scared him off he came back again to finish his meal
But I guess he is through now and so saying he took the dead rodent and raising the side window tossed him out
It was some time before everybody got quieted down again but finally the rat scare was over and the Bobbseys turned to dreams of the happy summer time they were enjoying
When Uncle Dan came up from the postoffice the next morning he brought a note from the freshair camp
Sandy has to go back
Nan whispered to Bert
His own father in the city has sent for him but mamma says not to say anything to Sandy or Freddie  they might worry
Aunt Sarah will drive over and bring Sandy then they can fix it
Im so sorry he has to go away
So am I answered Nans twin
I dont see why they cant let the little fellow alone when he is happy with us
But its his own father you know and something about a rich aunt
Maybe she is going to adopt Sandy
We ought to adopt him hes all right with us Bert grumbled
What did his rich aunt let him cry his eyes out for if she cared anything for him
Maybe she didnt know about him then Nan considered
Im sure everybody would have to love Sandy
At that Sandy ran along the path with Freddie
He looked like a live buttercup so fresh and bright his sunny sandy curls blowing in the soft breeze
Mrs Bobbsey had just called the children to her
We are going over to see Mrs Manily today Sandy she said
Wont you be awfully glad to see your own dear Mamma Manily again
Yep he faltered getting a better hold on Freddies hand but I want to come back here he finished
Poor darling
So many changes of home in his life had made him fear another
Oh I am sure you will come to see us again Mrs Bobbsey declared
Maybe you can come to Lakeport when we go home in the fall
No Im comin back here he insisted to see Freddie and auntie and uncle and all of them
Well we must get ready now said Mrs Bobbsey
John has gone to bring the wagon
Freddie insisted upon going to the camp with Sandy to make sure he would come down again he said
It was only the happiness of seeing Mamma Manily once more that kept Sandy from crying when they told him he was to go on a great big fast train to see his own papa
You see Mrs Manily explained to Mrs Bobbsey a wealthy aunt of Edwards expects to adopt him so we will have to give him up I am afraid
I hope you can keep track of him answered Mrs Bobbsey for we are all so attached to him
I think we would have applied to the Aid Society to let him share our home if the other claim had not come first and taken him from us
Then Freddie kissed Sandy goodbye
It was not the kind of a caress that girls give but the two little fellows said goodbye kissed each other very quickly then looked down at the ground in a brave effort not to cry
Mrs Bobbsey gave Sandy a real mothers ove sic kiss and he said Oh Im comin beck  tomorrow
I wont stay in the city
Ill just run away and come back
So Sandy was gone to another home and we hope he will grow to be as fine a boy as he has been a loving child
How lonely it seems said Nan that afternoon
Sandy was so jolly
Freddie followed John all over the place and could not find anything worth doing
Even Dinah sniffed a little when she fed the kittens and didnt have dat little buttercup around to tease dem
Well said Uncle Daniel next day we are going to have a very poor crop of apples this year so I think we had better have some cider made from the early fruit
Harry and Bert you can help John if you like and take a load of apples to the cider mill today to be ground
The boys willingly agreed to help John for they liked that sort of work especially Bert to whom it was new
Well take the red astrachans and sheepnoses today John said
Those trees over there are loaded you see
Then there are the orange apples in the next row they make good cider
The early apples were very plentiful and it took scarcely any time to make up a load and start off for the cider mill
Old Bennett who runs the mill is a queer chap Harry told Bert going over hes a soldier and hell be sure to quiz you on history
I like old soldiers Bert declared if they do talk a lot theyve got a lot to talk about
John said that was true and he agreed that old Ben Bennett was an interesting talker
Here we are said Harry as they pulled up before a kind of barn
Old Ben sat outside on his wooden bench
Hello Ben they called out together were bringing you work early this year
So much the better said the old soldier Theres nothing like work to keep a fellow young
Well you see went on John we cant count on any late apples this year so as we must have cider we thought that we had better make hay while the sun shines
How much have you got there
asked Ben looking over the load
About a barrel I guess answered John Could you run them through for us this morning
Certainly certainly
replied the others
Just haul them on and well set to work as quick as we did that morning at Harpers Ferry
Who is this lad
he asked indicating Bert
My cousin from the city said Harry Berts his name
Glad to see you Bert glad to see you
and the old soldier shook hands warmly
When they call you out son just tell them you knew Ben Bennett of the Sixth Massachusetts
And theyll give you a good gun and he clapped Bert on the back as if he actually saw a war coming down the hill back of the cider mill
It did not take long to unload the apples and get them inside
Well feed them in the hopper said John if you just get the sacks out Ben
All right all right my lad you can fire the first volley if youve a mind to and Ben opened up the big cask that held the apples to be chopped
When a few bushels had been filled in by the boys John began to grind
He turned the big stick round and round and this in turn set the wheel in motion that held the knives that chopped the apples
Where does the cider come from
asked Bert much interested
We havent come to that yet Harry replied they have to go through this hopper first
Fine juicy applies remarked Ben
Dont know but its just as well to make cider now when you have a crop like this
Father thought so Harry added putting in the last scoop of sheepnoses
If it turns to vinegar we can use it for pickles this fall
The next part of the process seemed very queer to Bert the pulp or chopped apples were put in sacks like mealbags folded over so as to hold in the pulp
A number of the folded sacks were then placed in another machine like a big layer cake Bert said and by turning a screw a great press was brought down upon the soft apples
Now the boys can turn John suggested and at this both Bert and Harry grabbed hold of the long handle that turned the press and started on a run around the machine
Oh there she comes
cried Bert as the juice began to ooze out in the tub
Thats cider all right
I smell it
Fine and sweet too declared Ben seeing to it that the tub was well under the spout
But I dont want you young fellows to do all my work
Oh this is fun spoke up Bert as the color mounted to his cheeks from the exercise
A strong stream was pouring into the tub now and the wholesome odor of good sweet cider filled the room
I think Ill try to get a horse this fall when my next pension comes due said old Ben Im a little stiff to run around with that handle like you young lads and sometimes Im full of rheumatism too
Father said he would sell our Bill very cheap if he wasnt put at hard work Harry said
We have had him so long we dont want to see him put to a plow or anything heavy but I should think this would be quite easy for him
Just the thing for a wornout warhorse like myself answered Ben much interested
Tell your father not to think of selling Bill till I get a chance to see him
I wont have my pension money for two months yet but I might make a deposit if any more work comes in
Oh that would be all right spoke up John
Mr Bobbsey would not be afraid to trust you
There now
exclaimed Ben I guess youve got all the juice out
John you can fill it in your keg I suppose since you have been so good as to do all the rest
Will you try it boys
Yes we would like to Ben Harry replied
Its a little warm to make cider in July and he wiped his face to cool off some
Ben went to his homemade cupboard and brought out a tin cup
Theres a cup he said that I drank out of at Harpers Ferry
I keep it in everyday use so as not to lose sight of it
Bert took the old tin cup and regarded it reverently
Think of us drinking out of that cup reflected Bert
Why its a war relic
Hows the cider
asked the old soldier
Couldnt be better said Harry
I guess the cup helps the flavor
This pleased old Ben for the light of glory that comes to all veterans whether private or general shone in his eyes
Well a soldier has two lives he declared
The one under fire and the other here tapping his head and meaning that the memories of battles made the other life
The cider was ready now and the Bobbseys prepared to leave
Ill tell father about Bill said Harry
Im sure he will save him for you
All right sonny  thank you thank you
Goodbye lads come again and maybe some day Ill give you the war cup
called the soldier
That would be a relic
exclaimed Harry
And I guess father will give him Bill for nothing for we always do what we can for old soldiers
I never saw cider made before remarked Bert and I think its fun
I had a good time today
Glad you did said John for vacation is slipping now and you want to enjoy it while it lasts
That evening at dinner the new cider was sampled and everybody pronounced it very fine
CHAPTER XXI WHAT THE WELL CONTAINED The next day everybody was out early
The men are going to clean the well Harry told the others and its lots of fun to see all the stuff they bring up
Can we go
Freddie asked
Nan will have to take charge of you and Flossie said Mrs Bobbsey for wells are very dangerous you know
This was arranged and the little ones promised to do exactly as Nan told them
The well to be cleaned was the big one at the corner of the road and the lane
From the well a number of families got their supply of water and it being on the road many passersby also enjoyed from it a good cold drink
There they come called Bert as two men dressed like divers came up the road
They wore complete rubber suits hipboots rubber coats and rubber caps
Then they had some queerlooking machines a windlass a force pump grappling irons and other tools
The boys gathered around the men  all interested of course in the work
Now keep back ordered Nan to the little ones
You can see just as well from this big stone and you will not be in any danger here
So Freddie and Flossie mounted the rock while the large boys got in closer to the well
First the men removed the well shelter  the wooden house that covered the well
Then they put over the big hole a platform open in the center
Over this they set up the windlass and then one of the men got in a big bucket Oh hell get drownded
cried Freddie
No he wont said Flossie
Hes a diver likes in my picture book
Is he Nan
asked the other little one
Yes he is one kind of a diver the sister explained only he doesnt have to wear that funny hat with air pipes in it like ocean divers wear
But hes away down in the water now persisted Freddie
Maybe hes dead
See there he is up again said Nan as the man in the bucket stepped out on the platform over the well
He just went down to see how deep the water was Bert called over
Now they are going to pump it out
The queerlooking pump with great long pipes was now sunk into the well and soon a strong stream of water was flowing from the spout
Oh lets sail boats
exclaimed Freddie and then all the bits of clean sticks and boards around were turned into boats by Flossie and Freddie
As the water had a good clear sweep down the hill the boats went along splendidly and the little folks had a very fine time of it indeed
Dont fall in called Nan
Freddie look out for that deep hole in the gutter where the tree fell down in the big flood
But for once Freddie managed to save himself while Flossie took no risk at all but walked past that part of the river without guiding her steamboat
Presently the water in the river became weaker and weaker until only the smallest stream made its way along
We cant sail boats in mud declared Freddie with some impatience
Lets go back and see what theyre doing at the well
Now the big pump had been removed and the man was going down in the bucket again
We lost lots of things in there remarked Tom Mason
I bet theyll bring up some queer stuff
It took a few minutes for the other man to send the lanterns down after his companion and then remove the top platform so as to give all the air and light possible to the bottom of the well
Now the man in the well can see stars in the sky said Harry to the other boys
But there are no stars in the sky Bert contradicted looking up at the clear blue sky of the fine summer day
Oh
yes there are laughed the man at the well lots of them too but you can only see them in the dark and its good and dark down in that deep well
This seemed very strange but of course it was true and the well cleaner told them if they didnt believe it just to look up a chimney some day and they would see the same strange thing
At a signal from the man in the well the other raised the first bucket of stuff and dumped it on the ground
Hurrah
Our football
exclaimed Harry yanking out from the muddy things the big black rubber ball lost the year before
And our baseball called Tom Mason as another ball was extracted from the pile
Peter Burns dinner pail laughed Harry rescuing that article from the heap
And somebodys old shoe
put in Bert but he didnt bother pulling that out of the mud
Oh theres Nellie Prentices rubber doll
exclaimed Harry
August and Ned were playing ball with it and let it fly in the well
Harry wiped the mud off the doll and brought it over to Nan
Im sure Nellie will be glad to get this back said Nan for its a good doll and she probably never had one since she lost it
The doll was not injured by its long imprisonment in the well and when washed up was as good as ever
Nan took charge of it and promised to give it to Nellie just as soon as she could go over to see her
Another bucket of stuff had been brought up by that time and the first thing pulled out was a big long pipe the kind Germans generally use
Thats old Hans Bruens declared Tom I remember the night he dropped it
Foolish Hans  to try to drink with a pipe like that in his mouth
laughed the well cleaner
As the pipe had a wooden bowl and a hard porcelain stem it was not broken so Tom took care of it knowing how glad Hans would be to get his old friend Johnnie Smoker back again
Besides all kinds of tin cups pails and saucepans the well was found to contain a good number of boys caps and some girls too that had slipped off in attempts made to get a good cool drink out of the bucket
Finally the man gave a signal that he was ready to come up and soon the windlass was adjusted again and the man in very muddy boots came to the top
Look at this
he said to the boys holding a beautiful gold watch
Ever hear of anyone losing a watch in the well
No one had heard of such a loss and as there was no name anywhere on the watch that might lead to its identification the well cleaner put it away in his vest pocket under the rubber coat
And what do you think of this
the man continued and drew from his pocket a beautiful string of pearl beads set in gold
My beads
My lost beads
screamed Nan
Oh how glad I am that you found them
She took the beads and looked at them carefully
They were a bit dirty but otherwise as good as ever
I thought I should never see these again said Nan
I must tell mamma of this
And she started for the house with flying feet
Mrs Bobbsey was glad indeed to learn that the strings of pearls had been found and everybody declared that Nan was certainly lucky
I am going to fasten them on good and tight after this said Nan and she did
Down by the well the man was not yet through handing over the things he had found
And theres a wedding ring
he said next while he turned out in his hand a thin gold band
Oh Mrs Burns lost that
chorused a number of the boys
She felt dreadful over it too
Shell be tickled to get that back all right
Well here said the man turning to Harry
I guess youre the biggest boy Ill let you take that back to Mrs Burns with my best wishes and he handed Harry the longlost wedding ring
It was only a short distance to Mrs Burns house and Harry lost no time in getting there
She was just delighted Harry told the man upon returning to the well
She says Peter will send you over something for finding it
No need replied the other theyre welcome to their own
The last part of the wellcleaning was the actual scrubbing of the big stone in the bottom
This stone had a hole in the middle through which the water sprang up and when the flag had been scrubbed the well was clean indeed
Now you people will have good water declared the men as they gathered all their tools having first put the top on the well and tried a bucketful of water before starting off
And are there really stars in the bottom of the well
questioned Freddie
Not exactly said the man but there are lots of other things in the bottoms of wells
You must get your daddy to show you the sky through a fireplace and you will then know how the stars look in daylight he finished saying goodbye to all and starting off for the big deep wellpump over in the picnic grove that had not been cleaned since it had been dug there three years before
CHAPTER XXII LITTLE JACK HORNER  GOODBYE Ive got a special delivery letter for you called the boy from the postoffice to Harry
Now when Jim Dexter rode his wheel with the special delivery mail everybody about Meadow Brook knew the rush letter bore important news
Jim jumped off his wheel and opening the little bag pulled out a letter for Mrs Richard Bobbsey from Mrs William Minturn of Ocean Cliff
Ill take it upstairs and have your book signed Harry offered while Jim sat on the porch to rest
Thats from Aunt Emily Bert told Harry when the messenger boy rode off again
I guess were going down to Ocean Cliff to visit there
I hope you wont go very soon replied Harry
Weve arranged a lot of ball matches next month
Were going to play the school nine first then were to play the boys at Cedarhurst and a picked nine from South Meadow Brook
Id like firstrate to be here for the games said Bert
Im a good batter
Youre the player we need then for Jim Smith is a firstrate pitcher and weve got really a fine catcher in Tom Mason but its hard to get a fellow to hit the ball far enough to give us runs
Oh Bert
called Nan running out of the house
That was an invitation for us to go to Aunt Emilys at the seashore
And Cousin Dorothy says we will have such a lovely time
But Im sure we could never have a better time than we had here
Harry she added to her cousin
Ill be awfully sorry to have you go Nan replied Harry
We have had so much fun all month
Ill just be dead lonesome Im sure and Harry sat down in dejection just as if his loved cousins had gone already
Theres no boy at Uncle Williams said Bert
Of course Nan will have Dorothy but Ill have to look around for a chum I suppose
Oh youll find lots of boys at the beach said Harry
And to think of the fun at the ocean
Mother says we will go to the shore next summer
I wish you were going with us said Bert politely
Maybe you will come down for a day while we are there suggested Nan
Aunt Emily isnt just exactly your aunt because shes mammas sister and its papa who is Uncle Daniels brother
But the Minturns Aunt Emilys folks you know have been up here and are all like real cousins
Were going away
exclaimed Freddie joining the others just then
Mamma says I can stick my toes in the water till the crabs bite me but Im going to have a fishhook and catch them first
Are you going to take Snoop
Harry asked his little cousin
Yep replied the youngster
He knows how to go on trains now
Dorothy has a pair of donkeys Nan told them and a cart we can go riding in every day
Ill be the driver announced Freddie
And I suppose youll have a sailboat Bert
said Harry
Not in the ocean said nervous little Flossie who had been listening all the time and never said a word until she thought there was some danger coming
Certainly not said Bert there is always a little lake of quiet water around ocean places
Aunt Sarah came out now all dressed for a drive
Well my dears she said you are going to Ocean Cliff tomorrow so you can invite all your Meadow Brook friends to a little lawn party today
Im going down now to the village to order some good things for you
I want you all to have a nice time this afternoon
Im going to give some of my books to Nettie said Flossie and some of my paper dolls too
Yes
Nettie has not many things to play with agreed Nan and we can get plenty more
Im going to get all my birds nests together said Bert and that pretty white birch bark to make picture frames for Christmas
Ive got lovely pressed flowers to put on Christmas postcards said Nan
Im going to mount them on plain white cards with little verses written for each friend
Wont that be pretty
Then what a time there was packing up again
Of course Mrs Bobbsey had expected to go and had most of the big things ready but the children had so many souvenirs
John gave me this cried Freddie pulling a great big pumpkin in his express wagon down to the house
And Im going to bring it to Aunt Emily
Oh how could we bring that
protested Nan
In the trunk of course Freddie insisted
Well I have to carry a box of ferns said Flossie Im going to take them for the porch
There are no ferns around the salt water mamma says
So each child had his or her own pet remembrances to carry away from Meadow Brook
We had better go and invite the girls for this afternoon Nan said to Flossie
And we must look after the boys Harry told Bert
A short invitation was not considered unusual in the country so it was an easy matter to get all the children together in time for the farewell lawn party
We all hope you will come again next year said Mildred Manners
We have had such a lovely time this summer
And I brought you this little handkerchief to remember me by
The gift was a choice bit of lace and Nan was much pleased to accept it
There is something to remember me by said Mabel Herold presenting Nan with a postcard album
The little girls brought Flossie a goldstriped cup and saucer a set of dolls patterns and the dearest little parasol
This last was from Bessie Dimple
And Nettie brought  what do you think
A little live duck for Freddie
It was just like a lump of cotton batting so soft and fluffy
Well fatten him up for Christmas laughed Bert joking
No you wont
snapped Freddie
I are going to have a little house for him and a lake and a boat   Are you going to teach him to row
teased Harry
Well he can swim better than  than   August Stout answered Bert remembering how August had fallen in the pond the day they went fishing
When the ice cream and cake had been served on the lawn Mrs Bobbsey brought out a big round white paper pie
This she placed in the middle of a nice clean spot on the lawn and all around the pie she drew out long white ribbons
On each ribbon was pinned the name of one of the guests
Now this is your Jack Horner pie said Mrs Bobbsey and when you put in your thumb you will pull out a plum
Nan read off the names and each girl or boy took the place assigned
Finally everybody had in hand a ribbon
Nettle has number one said Nan you pull first Nettie
Nettie jerked her ribbon and pulled out on the end of it the dearest little play piano
It was made of paper of course and so very small it could stand on Netties hand
Give us a tune
laughed the boys while Nettie saw it really was a little box of candy
Mildred next announced Nan
On the end of Mildreds ribbon came an automobile
This caused a laugh for Mildred was very fond of automobile rides
Mabel got a hobbyhorse  because she was learning to ride horseback
Nan received a sewing machine to remind her of the freshair work
Of course Tom Mason got a horse  a donkey it really was and Jack Hopkins gift was a wheelbarrow
Harry pulled out a boat and Bert got a cider barrel
They were all souvenirs full of candy favors for the party and they caused no end of fun
Freddie was the last to pull and he got  A bunch of real radishes from his own garden
But theyre not candy he protested as he burned his tongue with one
Well we are going to let you and Flossie put your thumbs in the pie said his mamma and whoever gets the prize will be the real Jack Horner
All but the center of the pie was gone now and in this Flossie first put her thumb
She could only put in one finger and only fish just one and she brought out  a little gold ring from Aunt Sarah
Oh isnt it sweet
the girls all exclaimed
Then Freddie had his turn
Cant I put in two fingers
he pleaded
No only one
his mother insisted
After careful preparation Freddie put in his thumb and pulled out a big candy plum
Open it
called Nan
The plum was put together in halves and when Freddie opened it he found a real going watch from Uncle Daniel
I can tell time
declared the happy boy for he had been learning the hours on Marthas clock in the kitchen
What time is it then
asked Bert
Freddie looked at his watch and counted around it two or three times
Four oclock
he said at last and he was only twenty minutes out of the way
The watch was the kind little boys use first with very plain figures on it and it was quite certain before Freddie paid his next visit to Uncle Daniels he would have learned how to tell time exactly on his first real watch
The party was over the children said good bye and besides the play favors each carried away a real gift that of friendship for the little Bobbseys
Maybe you can come down to the seashore on an excursion said Nan to her friends
They often have Sundayschool excursions to Sunset Beach
We will if we can answered Mabel but if I dont see you there I may call on you at Lakeport when we go to the city
Oh yes do
insisted Nan
Ill be home all winter I guess but I might go to boarding school
Anyhow Ill write to you
Goodbye girls
Goodbye
was the answering cry and then the visitors left in a crowd waving their hands as they disappeared around a turn of the road
What a perfectly lovely time we have had
declared Nan to Bert
Oh the country cant be beat
answered her twin brother
Still Ill be glad to get to the seashore wont you
Oh yes I want to see Cousin Dorothy
And I want to see the big ocean put in Freddie
I want to ride on one of the funny donkeys lisped Flossie
And I want to make a sand castle
Me too
chimed in Freddie
Hurrah for the seashore
cried Bert throwing his cap into the air and then all went into the house to get ready for a trip they looked forward to with extreme pleasure
And here let us say goodbye hoping to meet the Bobbsey Twins again
