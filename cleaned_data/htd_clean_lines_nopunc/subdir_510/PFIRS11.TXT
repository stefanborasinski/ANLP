The Country of the Pointed Firs SARAH ORNE JEWETT Note SARAH ORNE JEWETT 18491909 was born and died in South Berwick Maine
Her father was the regions most distinguished doctor and as a child Jewett often accompanied him on his round of patient visits
She began writing poetry at an early age and when she was only 19 her short story Mr Bruce was accepted by the Atlantic Monthly
Her association with that magazine continued and William Dean Howells who was editor at that time encouraged her to publish her first book Deephaven 1877 a collection of sketches published earlier in the Atlantic Monthly
Through her friendship with Howells Jewett became acquainted with Bostons literary elite including Annie Fields with whom she developed one of the most intimate and lasting relationships of her life
The Country of the Pointed Firs 1896 is considered Jewetts finest work described by Henry James as her beautiful little quantum of achievement
Despite Jamess diminutives the novel remains a classic
Because it is loosely structured many critics view the book not as a novel but a series of sketches however its structure is unified through both setting and theme
Jewett herself felt that her strengths as a writer lay not in plot development or dramatic tension but in character development
Indeed she determined early in her career to preserve a disappearing way of life and her novel can be read as a study of the effects of isolation and hardship on the inhabitants who lived in the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast
Jewett died in 1909 eight years after an accident that effectively ended her writing career
Her reputation had grown during her lifetime extending far beyond the bounds of the New England she loved

Perhaps it was the simple fact of acquaintance with that neighborhood which made it so attaching and gave such interest to the rocky shore and dark woods and the few houses which seemed to be securely wedged and treenailed in among the ledges by the Landing
These houses made the most of their seaward view and there was a gayety and determined floweriness in their bits of garden ground the smallpaned high windows in the peaks of their steep gables were like knowing eyes that watched the harbor and the far sealine beyond or looked northward all along the shore and its background of spruces and balsam firs
When one really knows a village like this and its surroundings it is like becoming acquainted with a single person
The process of falling in love at first sight is as final as it is swift in such a case but the growth of true friendship may be a lifelong affair
After a first brief visit made two or three summers before in the course of a yachting cruise a lover of Dunnet Landing returned to find the unchanged shores of the pointed firs the same quaintness of the village with its elaborate conventionalities all that mixture of remoteness and childish certainty of being the centre of civilization of which her affectionate dreams had told
One evening in June a single passenger landed upon the steamboat wharf
The tide was high there was a fine crowd of spectators and the younger portion of the company followed her with subdued excitement up the narrow street of the saltaired white clapboarded little town
II Mrs Todd LATER THERE WAS only one fault to find with this choice of a summer lodgingplace and that was its complete lack of seclusion
At first the tiny house of Mrs Almira Todd which stood with its end to the street appeared to be retired and sheltered enough from the busy world behind its bushy bit of a green garden in which all the blooming things two or three gay hollyhocks and some Londonpride were pushed back against the grayshingled wall
It was a queer little garden and puzzling to a stranger the few flowers being put at a disadvantage by so much greenery but the discovery was soon made that Mrs Todd was an ardent lover of herbs both wild and tame and the seabreezes blew into the low endwindow of the house laden with not only sweetbrier and sweet mary but balm and sage and borage and mint wormwood and southernwood
If Mrs Todd had occasion to step into the far corner of her herb plot she trod heavily upon thyme and made its fragrant presence known with all the rest
Being a very large person her full skirts brushed and bent almost every slender stalk that her feet missed
You could always tell when she was stepping about there even when you were half awake in the morning and learned to know in the course of a few weeks experience in exactly which corner of the garden she might be
At one side of this herb plot were other growths of a rustic pharmacopoeia great treasures and rarities among the commoner herbs
There were some strange and pungent odors that roused a dim sense and remembrance of something in the forgotten past
Some of these might once have belonged to sacred and mystic rites and have had some occult knowledge handed with them down the centuries but now they pertained only to humble compounds brewed at intervals with molasses or vinegar or spirits in a small caldron on Mrs Todds kitchen stove
They were dispensed to suffering neighbors who usually came at night as if by stealth bringing their own ancientlooking vials to be filled
One nostrum was called the Indian remedy and its price was but fifteen cents the whispered directions could be heard as customers passed the windows
With most remedies the purchaser was allowed to depart unadmonished from the kitchen Mrs Todd being a wise saver of steps but with certain vials she gave cautions standing in the doorway and there were other doses which had to be accompanied on their healing way as far as the gate while she muttered long chapters of directions and kept up an air of secrecy and importance to the last
It may not have been only the common aids of humanity with which she tried to cope it seemed sometimes as if love and hate and jealousy and adverse winds at sea might also find their proper remedies among the curious wildlooking plants in Mrs Todds garden
The village doctor and this learned herbalist were upon the best of terms
The good man may have counted upon the unfavorable effect of certain potions which he should find his opportunity in counteracting at any rate he now and then stopped and exchanged greetings with Mrs Todd over the picket fence
The conversation became at once professional after the briefest preliminaries and he would stand twirling a sweetscented sprig in his fingers and make suggestive jokes perhaps about her faith in a too persistent course of thoroughwort elixir in which my landlady professed such firm belief as sometimes to endanger the life and usefulness of worthy neighbors
To arrive at this quietest of seaside villages late in June when the busy herbgathering season was just beginning was also to arrive in the early prime of Mrs Todds activity in the brewing of oldfashioned spruce beer
This cooling and refreshing drink had been brought to wonderful perfection through a long series of experiments it had won immense local fame and the supplies for its manufacture were always giving out and having to be replenished
For various reasons the seclusion and uninterrupted days which had been looked forward to proved to be very rare in this otherwise delightful corner of the world
My hostess and I had made our shrewd business agreement on the basis of a simple cold luncheon at noon and liberal restitution in the matter of hot suppers to provide for which the lodger might sometimes be seen hurrying down the road late in the day with cunner line in hand
It was soon found that this arrangement made large allowance for Mrs Todds slow herbgathering progresses through woods and pastures
The sprucebeer customers were pretty steady in hot weather and there were many demands for different soothing syrups and elixirs with which the unwise curiosity of my early residence had made me acquainted
Knowing Mrs Todd to be a widow who had little beside this slender business and the income from one hungry lodger to maintain her ones energies and even interest were quickly bestowed until it became a matter of course that she should go afield every pleasant day and that the lodger should answer all peremptory knocks at the side door
In taking an occasional wisdomgiving stroll in Mrs Todds company and in acting as business partner during her frequent absences I found the July days fly fast and it was not until I felt myself confronted with too great pride and pleasure in the display one night of two dollars and twentyseven cents which I had taken in during the day that I remembered a long piece of writing sadly belated now which I was bound to do
To have been patted kindly on the shoulder and called darlin to have been offered a surprise of early mushrooms for supper to have had all the glory of making two dollars and twentyseven cents in a single day and then to renounce it all and withdraw from these pleasant successes needed much resolution
Literary employments are so vexed with uncertainties at best and it was not until the voice of conscience sounded louder in my ears than the sea on the nearest pebble beach that I said unkind words of withdrawal to Mrs Todd
She only became more wistfully affectionate than ever in her expressions and looked as disappointed as I expected when I frankly told her that I could no longer enjoy the pleasure of what we called seein folks
I felt that I was cruel to a whole neighborhood in curtailing her liberty in this most important season for harvesting the different wild herbs that were so much counted upon to ease their winter ails
Well dear she said sorrowfully Ive took great advantage o your bein here
I aint had such a season for years but I have never had nobody I could so trust
All you lack is a few qualities but with time youd gain judgment an experience an be very able in the business
Id stand right here an say it to anybody
Mrs Todd and I were not separated or estranged by the change in our business relations on the contrary a deeper intimacy seemed to begin
I do not know what herb of the night it was that used sometimes to send out a penetrating odor late in the evening after the dew had fallen and the moon was high and the cool air came up from the sea
Then Mrs Todd would feel that she must talk to somebody and I was only too glad to listen
We both fell under the spell and she either stood outside the window or made an errand to my sittingroom and told it might be very commonplace news of the day or as happened one misty summer night all that lay deepest in her heart
It was in this way that I came to know that she had loved one who was far above her
No dear him I speak of could never think of me she said
When we was young together his mother didnt favor the match an done everything she could to part us and folks thought we both married well butt want what either one of us wanted most an now were left alone again an might have had each other all the time
He was above bein a seafarin man an prospered more than most he come of a high family an my lot was plain an hard workin
I aint seen him for some years hes forgot our youthful feelins I expect but a womans heart is different them feelins comes back when you think youve done with em as sure as spring comes with the year
An Ive always had ways of hearin about him
She stood in the centre of a braided rug and its rings of black and gray seemed to circle about her feet in the dim light
Her height and massiveness in the low room gave her the look of a huge sibyl while the strange fragrance of the mysterious herb blew in from the little garden
III The Schoolhouse FOR SOME DAYS after this Mrs Todds customers came and went past my windows and hayingtime being nearly over strangers began to arrive from the inland country such was her widespread reputation
Sometimes I saw a pale young creature like a white windflower left over into midsummer upon whose face consumption had set its bright and wistful mark but oftener two stout hardworked women from the farms came together and detailed their symptoms to Mrs Todd in loud and cheerful voices combining the satisfactions of a friendly gossip with the medical opportunity
They seemed to give much from their own store of therapeutic learning
I became aware of the school in which my landlady had strengthened her natural gift but hers was always the governing mind and the final command Take of hysop one handful or whatever herb it was was received in respectful silence
One afternoon when I had listenedit was impossible not to listen with cottonless earsand then laughed and listened again with an idle pen in my hand during a particularly spirited and personal conversation I reached for my hat and taking blottingbook and all under my arm I resolutely fled further temptation and walked out past the fragrant green garden and up the dusty road
The way went straight uphill and presently I stopped and turned to look back
The tide was in the wide harbor was surrounded by its dark woods and the small wooden houses stood as near as they could get to the landing
Mrs Todds was the last house on the way inland
The gray ledges of the rocky shore were well covered with sod in most places and the pasture bayberry and wild roses grew thick among them
I could see the higher inland country and the scattered farms
On the brink of the hill stood a little white schoolhouse much windblown and weatherbeaten which was a landmark to seagoing folk from its door there was a most beautiful view of sea and shore
The summer vacation now prevailed and after finding the door unfastened and taking a long look through one of the seaward windows and reflecting afterward for some time in a shady place near by among the bayberry bushes I returned to the chief place of business in the village and to the amusement of two of the selectmen brothers and autocrats of Dunnet Landing I hired the schoolhouse for the rest of the vacation for fifty cents a week
Selfish as it may appear the retired situation seemed to possess great advantages and I spent many days there quite undisturbed with the seabreeze blowing through the small high windows and swaying the heavy outside shutters to and fro
I hung my hat and luncheonbasket on an entry nail as if I were a small scholar but I sat at the teachers desk as if I were that great authority with all the timid empty benches in rows before me
Now and then an idle sheep came and stood for a long time looking in at the door
At sundown I went back feeling most businesslike down toward the village again and usually met the flavor not of the herb garden but of Mrs Todds hot supper halfway up the hill
On the nights when there were evening meetings or other public exercises that demanded her presence we had tea very early and I was welcomed back as if from a long absence
Once or twice I feigned excuses for staying at home while Mrs Todd made distant excursions and came home late with both hands full and a heavily laden apron
This was in pennyroyal time and when the rare lobelia was in its prime and the elecampane was coming on
One day she appeared at the schoolhouse itself partly out of amused curiosity about my industries but she explained that there was no tansy in the neighborhood with such snap to it as some that grew about the schoolhouse lot
Being scuffed down all the spring made it grow so much the better like some folks that had it hard in their youth and were bound to make the most of themselves before they died
IV At the Schoolhouse Window ONE DAY I reached the schoolhouse very late owing to attendance upon the funeral of an acquaintance and neighbor with whose sad decline in health I had been familiar and whose last days both the doctor and Mrs Todd had tried in vain to ease
The services had taken place at one oclock and now at quarter past two I stood at the schoolhouse window looking down at the procession as it went along the lower road close to the shore
It was a walking funeral and even at that distance I could recognize most of the mourners as they went their solemn way
Mrs Begg had been very much respected and there was a large company of friends following to her grave
She had been brought up on one of the neighboring farms and each of the few times that I had seen her she professed great dissatisfaction with town life
The people lived too close together for her liking at the Landing and she could not get used to the constant sound of the sea
She had lived to lament three seafaring husbands and her house was decorated with West Indian curiosities specimens of conch shells and fine coral which they had brought home from their voyages in lumberladen ships
Mrs Todd had told me all our neighbors history
They had been girls together and to use her own phrase had both seen trouble till they knew the best and worst on t
I could see the sorrowful large figure of Mrs Todd as I stood at the window
She made a break in the procession by walking slowly and keeping the after part of it back
She held a handkerchief to her eyes and I knew with a pang of sympathy that hers was not affected grief
Beside her after much difficulty I recognized the one strange and unrelated person in all the company an old man who had always been mysterious to me
I could see his thin bending figure
He wore a narrow longtailed coat and walked with a stick and had the same cant to leeward as the windbent trees on the height above
This was Captain Littlepage whom I had seen only once or twice before sitting pale and old behind a closed window never out of doors until now
Mrs Todd always shook her head gravely when I asked a question and said that he wasnt what he had been once and seemed to class him with her other secrets
He might have belonged with a simple which grew in a certain slughaunted corner of the garden whose use she could never be betrayed into telling me though I saw her cutting the tops by moonlight once as if it were a charm and not a medicine like the great fading bloodroot leaves
I could see that she was trying to keep pace with the old captains lighter steps
He looked like an aged grasshopper of some strange human variety
Behind this pair was a short impatient little person who kept the captains house and gave it what Mrs Todd and others believed to be no proper sort of care
She was usually called that Mari Harris in subdued conversation between intimates but they treated her with anxious civility when they met her face to face
The baysheltered islands and the great sea beyond stretched away to the far horizon southward and eastward the little procession in the foreground looked futile and helpless on the edge of the rocky shore
It was a glorious day early in July with a clear high sky there were no clouds there was no noise of the sea
The song sparrows sang and sang as if with joyous knowledge of immortality and contempt for those who could so pettily concern themselves with death
I stood watching until the funeral procession had crept round a shoulder of the slope below and disappeared from the great landscape as if it had gone into a cave
An hour later I was busy at my work
Now and then a bee blundered in and took me for an enemy but there was a useful stick upon the teachers desk and I rapped to call the bees to order as if they were unruly scholars or waved them away from their riots over the ink which I had bought at the Landing store and discovered to be scented with bergamot as if to refresh the labors of anxious scribes
One anxious scribe felt very dull that day a sheepbell tinkled near by and called her wandering wits after it
The sentences failed to catch these lovely summer cadences
For the first time I began to wish for a companion and for news from the outer world which had been half unconsciously forgotten
Watching the funeral gave one a sort of pain
I began to wonder if I ought not to have walked with the rest instead of hurrying away at the end of the services
Perhaps the Sunday gown I had put on for the occasion was making this disastrous change of feeling but I had now made myself and my friends remember that I did not really belong to Dunnet Landing
I sighed and turned to the halfwritten page again
V Captain Littlepage IT WAS A long time after this an hour was very long in that coast town where nothing stole away the shortest minute
I had lost myself completely in work when I heard footsteps outside
There was a steep footpath between the upper and the lower road which I climbed to shorten the way as the children had taught me but I believed that Mrs Todd would find it inaccessible unless she had occasion to seek me in great haste
I wrote on feeling like a besieged miser of time while the footsteps came nearer and the sheepbell tinkled away in haste as if someone had shaken a stick in its wearers face
Then I looked and saw Captain Littlepage passing the nearest window the next moment he tapped politely at the door
Come in sir I said rising to meet him and he entered bowing with much courtesy
I stepped down from the desk and offered him a chair by the window where he seated himself at once being sadly spent by his climb
I returned to my fixed seat behind the teachers desk which gave him the lower place of a scholar
You ought to have the place of honor Captain Littlepage I said
A happy rural seat of various views he quoted as he gazed out into the sunshine and up the long wooded shore
Then he glanced at me and looked all about him as pleased as a child
My quotation was from Paradise Lost the greatest of poems I suppose you know
and I nodded
Theres nothing that ranks to my mind with Paradise Lost its all lofty all lofty he continued
Shakespeare was a great poet he copied life but you have to put up with a great deal of low talk
I now remembered that Mrs Todd had told me one day that Captain Littlepage had overset his mind with too much reading she had also made dark reference to his having spells of some unexplainable nature
I could not help wondering what errand had brought him out in search of me
There was something quite charming in his appearance it was a face thin and delicate with refinement but worn into appealing lines as if he had suffered from loneliness and misapprehension
He looked with his careful precision of dress as if he were the object of cherishing care on the part of elderly unmarried sisters but I knew Mari Harris to be a very commonplace inelegant person who would have no such standards it was plain that the captain was his own attentive valet
He sat looking at me expectantly
I could not help thinking that with his queer head and length of thinness he was made to hop along the road of life rather than to walk
The captain was very grave indeed and I bade my inward spirit keep close to discretion
Poor Mrs Begg has gone I ventured to say
I still wore my Sunday gown by way of showing respect
She has gone said the captainvery easy at the last I was informed she slipped away as if she were glad of the opportunity
I thought of the Countess of Carberry and felt that history repeated itself
She was one of the old stock continued Captain Littlepage with touching sincerity
She was very much looked up to in this town and will be missed
I wondered as I looked at him if he had sprung from a line of ministers he had the refinement of look and air of command which are the heritage of the old ecclesiastical families of New England
But as Darwin says in his autobiography there is no such king as a seacaptain he is greater even than a king or a schoolmaster
Captain Littlepage moved his chair out of the wake of the sunshine and still sat looking at me
I began to be very eager to know upon what errand he had come
It may be found out some o these days he said earnestly
We may know it all the next step where Mrs Begg is now for instance
Certainty not conjecture is what we all desire
I suppose we shall know it all some day said I
We shall know it while yet below insisted the captain with a flush of impatience on his thin cheeks
We have not looked for truth in the right direction
I know what I speak of those who have laughed at me little know how much reason my ideas are based upon
He waved his hand toward the village below
In that handful of houses they fancy that they comprehend the universe
I smiled and waited for him to go on
I am an old man as you can see he continued and I have been a shipmaster the greater part of my lifefortythree years in all
You may not think it but I am above eighty years of age
He did not look so old and I hastened to say so
You must have left the sea a good many years ago then Captain Littlepage
I said
I should have been serviceable at least five or six years more he answered
My acquaintance with certainmy experience upon a certain occasion I might say gave rise to prejudice
I do not mind telling you that I chanced to learn of one of the greatest discoveries that man has ever made
Now we were approaching dangerous ground but a sudden sense of his sufferings at the hands of the ignorant came to my help and I asked to hear more with all the deference I really felt
A swallow flew into the schoolhouse at this moment as if a kingbird were after it and beat itself against the walls for a minute and escaped again to the open air but Captain Littlepage took no notice whatever of the flurry
I had a valuable cargo of general merchandise from the London docks to Fort Churchill a station of the old company on Hudsons Bay said the captain earnestly
We were delayed in lading and baffled by head winds and a heavy tumbling sea all the way north about and across
Then the fog kept us off the coast and when I made port at last it was too late to delay in those northern waters with such a vessel and such a crew as I had
They cared for nothing and idled me into a fit of sickness but my first mate was a good excellent man with no more idea of being frozen in there until spring than I had so we made what speed we could to get clear of Hudsons Bay and off the coast
I owned an eighth of the vessel and he owned a sixteenth of her
She was a fullrigged ship called the Minerva but she was getting old and leaky
I meant it should be my last vyge in her and so it proved
She had been an excellent vessel in her day
Of the cowards aboard her I cant say so much
Then you were wrecked
I asked as he made a long pause
I want caught astern o the lighter by any fault of mine said the captain gloomily
We left Fort Churchill and run out into the Bay with a light pair o heels but I had been vexed to death with their redtape rigging at the companys office and chilled with stayin on deck an tryin to hurry up things and when we were well out o sight o land headin for Hudsons Straits I had a bad turn o some sort o fever and had to stay below
The days were getting short and we made good runs all well on board but me and the crew done their work by dint of hard driving
I began to find this unexpected narrative a little dull
Captain Littlepage spoke with a kind of slow correctness that lacked the longshore high flavor to which I had grown used but I listened respectfully while he explained the winds having become contrary and talked on in a dreary sort of way about his voyage the bad weather and the disadvantages he was under in the lightness of his ship which bounced about like a chip in a bucket and would not answer the rudder or properly respond to the most careful setting of sails
So there we were blowin along anyways he complained but looking at me at this moment and seeing that my thoughts were unkindly wandering he ceased to speak
It was a hard life at sea in those days I am sure said I with redoubled interest
It was a dogs life said the poor old gentleman quite reassured but it made men of those who followed it
I see a change for the worse even in our own town here full of loafers now small and poor as tis who once would have followed the sea every lazy soul of em
There is no occupation so fit for just that class o men who never get beyond the focasle
I view it in addition that a community narrows down and grows dreadful ignorant when it is shut up to its own affairs and gets no knowledge of the outside world except from a cheap unprincipled newspaper
In the old days a good part o the best men here knew a hundred ports and something of the way folks lived in them
They saw the world for themselves and likes not their wives and children saw it with them
They may not have had the best of knowledge to carry with em sightseein but they were some acquainted with foreign lands an their laws an could see outside the battle for town clerk here in Dunnet they got some sense o proportion
Yes they lived more dignified and their houses were better within an without
Shippings a terrible loss to this part o New England from a social point o view maam
I have thought of that myself I returned with my interest quite awakened
It accounts for the change in a great many thingsthe sad disappearance of seacaptainsdoesnt it
A shipmaster was apt to get the habit of reading said my companion brightening still more and taking on a most touching air of unreserve
A captain is not expected to be familiar with his crew and for companys sake in dull days and nights he turns to his book
Most of us old shipmasters came to know most everything about something one would take to readin on farming topics and some were great on medicinebut Lord help their poor crewsor some were all for history and now and then thered be one like me that gave his time to the poets
I was well acquainted with a shipmaster that was all for bees an beekeepin and if you met him in port and went aboard hed sit and talk a terrible while about their havin so much information and the money that could be made out of keepin em
He was one of the smartest captains that ever sailed the seas but they used to call the Newcastle a great bark he commanded for many years Tuttles beehive
There was old Capn Jameson he had notions of Solomons Temple and made a very handsome little model of the same right from the Scripture measurements sames other sailors make little ships and design new tricks of rigging and all that
No theres nothing to take the place of shipping in a place like ours
These bicycles offend me dreadfully they dont afford no real opportunities of experience such as a man gained on a voyage
No when folks left home in the old days they left it to some purpose and when they got home they stayed there and had some pride in it
Theres no largeminded way of thinking now the worst have got to be best and rule everything were all turned upside down and going back year by year
Oh no Captain Littlepage I hope not said I trying to soothe his feelings
There was a silence in the schoolhouse but we could hear the noise of the water on a beach below
It sounded like the strange warning wave that gives notice of the turn of the tide
A late golden robin with the most joyful and eager of voices was singing close by in a thicket of wild roses
VI The Waiting Place HOW DID YOU manage with the rest of that rough voyage on the Minerva
I asked
I shall be glad to explain to you said Captain Littlepage forgetting his grievances for the moment
If I had a map at hand I could explain better
We were driven to and fro way up toward what we used to call Parrys Discoveries and lost our bearings
It was thick and foggy and at last I lost my ship she drove on a rock and we managed to get ashore on what I took to be a barren island the few of us that were left alive
When she first struck the sea was somewhat calmer than it had been and most of the crew against orders manned the longboat and put off in a hurry and were never heard of more
Our own boat upset but the carpenter kept himself and me above water and we drifted in
I had no strength to call upon after my recent fever and laid down to die but he found the tracks of a man and dog the second day and got along the shore to one of those far missionary stations that the Moravians support
They were very poor themselves and in distress twas a useless place
There were but few Esquimaux left in that region
There we remained for some time and I became acquainted with strange events
The captain lifted his head and gave me a questioning glance
I could not help noticing that the dulled look in his eyes had gone and there was instead a clear intentness that made them seem dark and piercing
There was a supply ship expected and the pastor an excellent Christian man made no doubt that we should get passage in her
He was hoping that orders would come to break up the station but everything was uncertain and we got on the best we could for a while
We fished and helped the people in other ways there was no other way of paying our debts
I was taken to the pastors house until I got better but they were crowded and I felt myself in the way and made excuse to join with an old seaman a Scotchman who had built him a warm cabin and had room in it for another
He was looked upon with regard and had stood by the pastor in some troubles with the people
He had been on one of those English exploring parties that found one end of the road to the north pole but never could find the other
We lived like dogs in a kennel or so youd thought if you had seen the hut from the outside but the main thing was to keep warm there were piles of birdskins to lie on and hed made him a good bunk and there was another for me
Twas dreadful dreary waitin there we begun to think the supply steamer was lost and my poor ship broke up and strewed herself all along the shore
We got to watching on the headlands my men and me knew the people were short of supplies and had to pinch themselves
It ought to read in the Bible Man cannot live by fish alone if theyd told the truth of things taint bread that wears the worst on you
First part of the time old Gaffett that I lived with seemed speechless and I didnt know what to make of him nor he of me I dare say but as we got acquainted I found hed been through more disasters than I had and had troubles that want going to let him live a great while
It used to ease his mind to talk to an understanding person so we used to sit and talk together all day if it rained or blew so that we couldnt get out
Id got a bad blow on the back of my head at the time we came ashore and it pained me at times and my strength was broken anyway Ive never been so able since
Captain Littlepage fell into a reverie
Then I had the good of my reading he explained presently
I had no books the pastor spoke but little English and all his books were foreign but I used to say over all I could remember
The old poets little knew what comfort they could be to a man
I was well acquainted with the works of Milton but up there it did seem to me as if Shakespeare was the king he has his sea terms very accurate and some beautiful passages were calming to the mind
I could say them over until I shed tears there was nothing beautiful to me in that place but the stars above and those passages of verse
Gaffett was always brooding and brooding and talking to himself he was afraid he should never get away and it preyed upon his mind
He thought when I got home I could interest the scientific men in his discovery but theyre all taken up with their own notions some didnt even take pains to answer the letters I wrote
You observe that I said this crippled man Gaffett had been shipped on a voyage of discovery
I now tell you that the ship was lost on its return and only Gaffett and two officers were saved off the Greenland coast and he had knowledge later that those men never got back to England the brig they shipped on was run down in the night
So no other living soul had the facts and he gave them to me
There is a strange sort of a country way up north beyond the ice and strange folks living in it
Gaffett believed it was the next world to this
What do you mean Captain Littlepage
I exclaimed
The old man was bending forward and whispering he looked over his shoulder before he spoke the last sentence
To hear old Gaffett tell about it was something awful he said going on with his story quite steadily after the moment of excitement had passed
Twas first a tale of dogs and sledges and cold and wind and snow
Then they begun to find the ice grow rotten they had been frozen in and got into a current flowing north far up beyond Fox Channel and they took to their boats when the ship got crushed and this warm current took them out of sight of the ice and into a great open sea and they still followed it due north just the very way they had planned to go
Then they struck a coast that wasnt laid down or charted but the cliffs were such that no boat could land until they found a bay and struck across under sail to the other side where the shore looked lower they were scant of provisions and out of water but they got sight of something that looked like a great town
For Gods sake Gaffett
said I the first time he told me
You dont mean a town two degrees farther north than ships had ever been
for hed got their course marked on an old chart that hed pieced out at the top but he insisted upon it and told it over and over again to be sure I had it straight to carry to those who would be interested
There was no snow and ice he said after they had sailed some days with that warm current which seemed to come right from under the ice that theyd been pinched up in and had been crossing on foot for weeks
But what about the town
I asked
Did they get to the town
They did said the captain and found inhabitants twas an awful condition of things
It appeared as near as Gaffett could express it like a place where there was neither living nor dead
They could see the place when they were approaching it by sea pretty near like any town and thick with habitations but all at once they lost sight of it altogether and when they got close inshore they could see the shapes of folks but they never could get near themall blowing gray figures that would pass along alone or sometimes gathered in companies as if they were watching
The men were frightened at first but the shapes never came near themit was as if they blew back and at last they all got bold and went ashore and found birds eggs and sea fowl like any wild northern spot where creatures were tame and folks had never been and there was good water
Gaffett said that he and another man came near one o the fogshaped men that was going along slow with the look of a pack on his back among the rocks an they chased him but Lord
he flittered away out o sight like a leaf the wind takes with it or a piece of cobweb
They would make as if they talked together but there was no sound of voices and they acted as if they didnt see us but only felt us coming towards them says Gaffett one day trying to tell the particulars
They couldnt see the town when they were ashore
One day the captain and the doctor were gone till night up across the high land where the town had seemed to be and they came back at night beat out and white as ashes and wrote and wrote all next day in their notebooks and whispered together full of excitement and they were sharpspoken with the men when they offered to ask any questions
Then there came a day said Captain Littlepage leaning toward me with a strange look in his eyes and whispering quickly
The men all swore they wouldnt stay any longer the man on watch early in the morning gave the alarm and they all put off in the boat and got a little way out to sea
Those folks or whatever they were come about em like bats all at once they raised incessant armies and come as if to drive em back to sea
They stood thick at the edge o the water like the ridges o grim war no thought o flight none of retreat
Sometimes a standing fight then soaring on main wing tormented all the air
And when theyd got the boat out o reach o danger Gaffett said they looked back and there was the town again standing up just as theyd seen it first comin on the coast
Say what you might they all believed twas a kind of waitingplace between this world an the next
The captain had sprung to his feet in his excitement and made excited gestures but he still whispered huskily
Sit down sir I said as quietly as I could and he sank into his chair quite spent
Gaffett thought the officers were hurrying home to report and to fit out a new expedition when they were all lost
At the time the men got orders not to talk over what they had seen the old man explained presently in a more natural tone
Werent they all starving and wasnt it a mirage or something of that sort
I ventured to ask
But he looked at me blankly
Gaffett had got so that his mind ran on nothing else he went on
The ships surgeon let fall an opinion to the captain one day that twas some condition o the light and the magnetic currents that let them see those folks
Twant a rightfeeling part of the world anyway they had to battle with the compass to make it serve an everything seemed to go wrong
Gaffett had worked it out in his own mind that they was all common ghosts but the conditions were unusual favorable for seeing them
He was always talking about the Gegraphical Society but he never took proper steps as I viewed it now and stayed right there at the mission
He was a good deal crippled and thought theyd confine him in some jail of a hospital
He said he was waiting to find the right men to tell somebody bound north
Once in a while they stopped there to leave a mail or something
He was set in his notions and let two or three proper explorin expeditions go by him because he didnt like their looks but when I was there he had got restless fearin he might be taken away or something
He had all his directions written out straight as a string to give the right ones
I wanted him to trust em to me so I might have something to show but he wouldnt
I suppose hes dead now
I wrote to him an I done all I could
Twill be a great exploit some o these days
I assented absentmindedly thinking more just then of my companions alert determined look and the seafaring ready aspect that had come to his face but at this moment there fell a sudden change and the old pathetic scholarly look returned
Behind me hung a map of North America and I saw as I turned a little that his eyes were fixed upon the northernmost regions and their careful recent outlines with a look of bewilderment
VII The Outer Island GAFFETT WITH HIS good bunk and the birdskins the story of the wreck of the Minerva the humanshaped creatures of fog and cobweb the great words of Milton with which he described their onslaught upon the crew all this moving tale had such an air of truth that I could not argue with Captain Littlepage
The old man looked away from the map as if it had vaguely troubled him and regarded me appealingly
We were just speaking ofand he stopped
I saw that he had suddenly forgotten his subject
There were a great many persons at the funeral I hastened to say
Oh yes the captain answered with satisfaction
All showed respect who could
The sad circumstances had for a moment slipped my mind
Yes Mrs Begg will be very much missed
She was a capital manager for her husband when he was at sea
Oh yes shipping is a very great loss
And he sighed heavily
There was hardly a man of any standing who didnt interest himself in some way in navigation
It always gave credit to a town
I call it lowwater mark now here in Dunnet
He rose with dignity to take leave and asked me to stop at his house some day when he would show me some outlandish things that he had brought home from sea
I was familiar with the subject of the decadence of shipping interests in all its affecting branches having been already some time in Dunnet and I felt sure that Captain Littlepages mind had now returned to a safe level
As we came down the hill toward the village our ways divided and when I had seen the old captain well started on a smooth piece of sidewalk which would lead him to his own door we parted the best of friends
Step in some afternoon he said as affectionately as if I were a fellowshipmaster wrecked on the lee shore of age like himself
I turned toward home and presently met Mrs Todd coming toward me with an anxious expression
I see you sleevin the old gentleman down the hill she suggested
Yes
Ive had a very interesting afternoon with him I answered and her face brightened
Oh then hes all right
I was afraid twas one o his flighty spells an Mari Harris wouldnt Yes I returned smiling he has been telling me some old stories but we talked about Mrs Begg and the funeral beside and Paradise Lost
I expect he got tellin of you some o his great narratives she answered looking at me shrewdly
Funerals always sets him goin
Some o them tales hangs together tolerble well she added with a sharper look than before
An hes been a great reader all his seafarin days
Some thinks he overdid and affected his head but for a man o his years hes amazin now when hes at his best
Oh he used to be a beautiful man
We were standing where there was a fine view of the harbor and its long stretches of shore all covered by the great army of the pointed firs darkly cloaked and standing as if they waited to embark
As we looked far seaward among the outer islands the trees seemed to march seaward still going steadily over the heights and down to the waters edge
It had been growing gray and cloudy like the first evening of autumn and a shadow had fallen on the darkening shore
Suddenly as we looked a gleam of golden sunshine struck the outer islands and one of them shone out clear in the light and revealed itself in a compelling way to our eyes
Mrs Todd was looking off across the bay with a face full of affection and interest
The sunburst upon that outermost island made it seem like a sudden revelation of the world beyond this which some believe to be so near
Thats where mother lives said Mrs Todd
Cant we see it plain
I was brought up out there on Green Island
I know every rock an bush on it
Your mother
I exclaimed with great interest
Yes dear certin Ive got her yet olds I be
Shes one of them spry lightfooted little women always was an light hearted too answered Mrs Todd with satisfaction
Shes seen all the trouble folks can see without its her last sickness an shes got a word of courage for everybody
Life aint spoilt her a mite
Shes eightysix an Im sixtyseven and Ive seen the time Ive felt a good sight the oldest
Land sakes alive
says she last time I was out to see her
How you do lurch about steppin into a bot
I laughed so I liked to have gone right over into the water an we pushed off an left her laughin there on the shore
The light had faded as we watched
Mrs Todd had mounted a gray rock and stood there grand and architectural like a caryatide
Presently she stepped down and we continued our way homeward
You an me well take a bot an go out some day and see mother she promised me
Twould please her very much an theres one or two scace herbs grows better on the island than anywhere else
I aint seen their like nowheres here on the main
Now Im goin right down to get us each a mug o my beer she announced as we entered the house an I believe Ill sneak in a little mite o camomile
Goin to the funeral an all I feel to have had a very wearin afternoon
I heard her going down into the cool little cellar and then there was considerable delay
When she returned mug in hand I noticed the taste of camomile in spite of my protest but its flavor was disguised by some other herb that I did not know and she stood over me until I drank it all and said that I liked it
I dont give that to everybody said Mrs Todd kindly and I felt for a moment as if it were part of a spell and incantation and as if my enchantress would now begin to look like the cobweb shapes of the arctic town
Nothing happened but a quiet evening and some delightful plans that we made about going to Green Island and on the morrow there was the clear sunshine and blue sky of another day
VIII Green Island ONE MORNING very early I heard Mrs Todd in the garden outside my window
By the unusual loudness of her remarks to a passerby and the notes of a familiar hymn which she sang as she worked among the herbs and which came as if directed purposely to the sleepy ears of my consciousness I knew that she wished I would wake up and come and speak to her
In a few minutes she responded to a morning voice from behind the blinds
I expect youre goin up to your schoolhouse to pass all this pleasant day yes I expect youre goin to be dreadful busy she said despairingly
Perhaps not said I
Why whats going to be the matter with you Mrs
Todd
For I supposed that she was tempted by the fine weather to take one of her favorite expeditions along the shore pastures to gather herbs and simples and would like to have me keep the house
No I dont want to go nowhere by land she answered gaylyno not by land but I dont knows we shall have a better day all the rest of the summer to go out to Green Island an see mother
I waked up early thinkin of her
The winds light northeasttwill take us right straight out an this time o year its liable to change round southwest an fetch us home pretty long late in the afternoon
Yes its goin to be a good day
Speak to the captain and the Bowden boy if you see anybody going by toward the landing said I
Well take the big boat
Oh my sakes
now you let me do things my way said Mrs Todd scornfully
No dear we wont take no big bot
Ill just git a handy dory an Johnny Bowden an me well man her ourselves
I dont want no abler bot than a good dory an a nice light breeze aint goin to make no sea an Johnnys my cousins sonmotherll like to have him come an hell be down to the herrin weirs all the time were there anyway we dont want to carry no men folks havin to be considered every minute an takin up all our time
No you let me do well just slip out an see mother by ourselves
I guess what breakfast youll wants about ready now
I had become well acquainted with Mrs Todd as landlady herb gatherer and rustic philosopher we had been discreet fellow passengers once or twice when I had sailed up the coast to a larger town than Dunnet Landing to do some shopping but I was yet to become acquainted with her as a mariner
An hour later we pushed off from the landing in the desired dory
The tide was just on the turn beginning to fall and several friends and acquaintances stood along the side of the dilapidated wharf and cheered us by their words and evident interest
Johnny Bowden and I were both rowing in haste to get out where we could catch the breeze and put up the small sail which lay clumsily furled along the gunwale
Mrs Todd sat aft a stern and unbending lawgiver
You better let her drift well get there bout as quick the tidell take her right out from under these old buildins theres plenty wind outside
Your bot aint trimmed proper Mis Todd
exclaimed a voice from shore
Youre loded so the botll drag you cant git her before the wind maam
You set midships Mis Todd an let the boy hold the sheet n steer after he gits the sail up you wont never git out to Green Island that way
Shes loded bad your bot isshes heavy behinds she is now
Mrs Todd turned with some difficulty and regarded the anxious adviser my right oar flew out of water and we seemed about to capsize
That you Asa
Goodmornin she said politely
I alays liked the starn seat best
Whend you git back from up country
This allusion to Asas origin was not lost upon the rest of the company
We were some little distance from shore but we could hear a chuckle of laughter and Asa a person who was too ready with his criticism and advice on every possible subject turned and walked indignantly away
When we caught the wind we were soon on our seaward course and only stopped to underrun a trawl for the floats of which Mrs Todd looked earnestly explaining that her mother might not be prepared for three extra to dinner it was her brothers trawl and she meant to just run her eye along for the right sort of a little haddock
I leaned over the boats side with great interest and excitement while she skillfully handled the long line of hooks and made scornful remarks upon worthless baitconsuming creatures of the sea as she reviewed them and left them on the trawl or shook them off into the waves
At last we came to what she pronounced a proper haddock and having taken him on board and ended his life resolutely we went our way
As we sailed along I listened to an increasingly delightful commentary upon the islands some of them barren rocks or at best giving sparse pasturage for sheep in the early summer
On one of these an eager little flock ran to the waters edge and bleated at us so affectingly that I would willingly have stopped but Mrs Todd steered away from the rocks and scolded at the sheeps mean owner an acquaintance of hers who grudged the little salt and still less care which the patient creatures needed
The hot midsummer sun makes prisons of these small islands that are a paradise in early June with their cool springs and short thick growing grass
On a larger island farther out to sea my entertaining companion showed me with glee the small houses of two farmers who shared the island between them and declared that for three generations the people had not spoken to each other even in times of sickness or death or birth
When the news come that the war was over one of em knew it a week and never stepped across his wall to tell the other she said
There they enjoy it theyve got to have somethin to interest em in such a place tis a good deal more tryin to be tied to folks you dont like than tis to be alone
Each of em tell the neighbors their wrongs plenty likes to hear and tell again them as fetch a bonell carry one an so they keep the fight agoin
I must say I like variety myself some folks washes Monday an irons Tuesday the whole year round even if the circus is goin by
A long time before we landed at Green Island we could see the small white house standing high like a beacon where Mrs Todd was born and where her mother lived on a green slope above the water with dark spruce woods still higher
There were crops in the fields which we presently distinguished from one another
Mrs Todd examined them while we were still far at sea
Mothers late potatoes looks backward aint had rain enough so far she pronounced her opinion
They look weedier than what they call Front Street down to Cowper Centre
I expect brother William is so occupied with his herrin weirs an servin out bait to the schooners that he dont think once a day of the land
Whats the flag for up above the spruces there behind the house
I inquired with eagerness
Oh thats the sign for herrin she explained kindly while Johnny Bowden regarded me with contemptuous surprise
When they get enough for schooners they raise that flag an when tis a poor catch in the weir pocket they just fly a little signal down by the shore an then the small bots comes and get enough an over for their trawls
There look
there she is mother sees us shes wavin somethin out o the fore door
Shell be to the landin place quicks we are
I looked and could see a tiny flutter in the doorway but a quicker signal had made its way from the heart on shore to the heart on the sea
How do you suppose she knows it is me
said Mrs Todd with a tender smile on her broad face
There you never get over bein a child longs you have a mother to go to
Look at the chimney now shes gone right in an brightened up the fire
Well there Im glad mothers well youll enjoy seein her very much
Mrs Todd leaned back into her proper position and the boat trimmed again
She took a firmer grasp of the sheet and gave an impatient look up at the gaff and the leech of the little sail and twitched the sheet as if she urged the wind like a horse
There came at once a fresh gust and we seemed to have doubled our speed
Soon we were near enough to see a tiny figure with handkerchiefed head come down across the field and stand waiting for us at the cove above a curve of pebble beach
Presently the dory grated on the pebbles and Johnny Bowden who had been kept in abeyance during the voyage sprang out and used manful exertions to haul us up with the next wave so that Mrs Todd could make a dry landing
You don that very well she said mounting to her feet and coming ashore somewhat stiffly but with great dignity refusing our outstretched hands and returning to possess herself of a bag which had lain at her feet
Well mother here I be
she announced with indifference but they stood and beamed in each others faces
Lookin pretty well for an old lady aint she
said Mrs Todds mother turning away from her daughter to speak to me
She was a delightful little person herself with bright eyes and an affectionate air of expectation like a child on a holiday
You felt as if Mrs Blackett were an old and dear friend before you let go her cordial hand
We all started together up the hill
Now dont you haste too fast mother said Mrs Todd warningly tis a far reach o risin ground to the fore door and you wont set an get your breath when youre once there but go trotting about
Now dont you go a mite faster than we proceed with this bag an basket
Johnny there ll fetch up the haddock
I just made one stop to underrun Williams trawl till I come to jes such a fishs I thought youd want to make one o your nice chowders of
Ive brought an onion with me that was layin about on the windowsill at home
Thats just what I was wantin said the hostess
I give a sigh when you spoke o chowder knowin my onions was out
William forgot to replenish us last time he was to the Landin
Dont you haste so yourself Almiry up this risin ground
I hear you commencin to wheeze aready
This mild revenge seemed to afford great pleasure to both giver and receiver
They laughed a little and looked at each other affectionately and then at me
Mrs Todd considerately paused and faced about to regard the wide sea view
I was glad to stop being more out of breath than either of my companions and I prolonged the halt by asking the names of the neighboring islands
There was a fine breeze blowing which we felt more there on the high land than when we were running before it in the dory
Why this aint that kitten I saw when I was out last the one that I said didnt appear likely
exclaimed Mrs Todd as we went our way
Thats the one Almiry said her mother
She always had a likely look to me an shes right after business
I never see such a mouser for one of her age
Ift want for William I never should have housed that other dronin old thing so long but he sets by her on account of her havin a bob tail
I dont deem it advisable to maintain cats just on account of their havin bob tails theyre like all other curiosities good for them that wants to see m twice
This kitten catches mice for both an keeps me respectable as I aint been for a year
Shes a real understandin little help this kitten is
I picked her from among five Miss Augusta Pernell had over to Burnt Island said the old woman trudging along with the kitten close at her skirts
Augusta she says to me Why Mis Blackett youve took and homeliest and says I Ive got the smartest Im satisfied
Id trust nobody soonern you to pick out a kitten mother said the daughter handsomely and we went on in peace and harmony
The house was just before us now on a green level that looked as if a huge hand had scooped it out of the long green field we had been ascending
A little way above the dark spruce woods began to climb the top of the hill and cover the seaward slopes of the island
There was just room for the small farm and the forest we looked down at the fishhouse and its rough sheds and the weirs stretching far out into the water
As we looked upward the tops of the firs came sharp against the blue sky
There was a great stretch of rough pastureland round the shoulder of the island to the eastward and here were all the thickscattered gray rocks that kept their places and the gray backs of many sheep that forever wandered and fed on the thin sweet pasturage that fringed the ledges and made soft hollows and strips of green turf like growing velvet
I could see the rich green of bayberry bushes here and there where the rocks made room
The air was very sweet one could not help wishing to be a citizen of such a complete and tiny continent and home of fisherfolk
The house was broad and clean with a roof that looked heavy on its low walls
It was one of the houses that seem firmrooted in the ground as if they were twothirds below the surface like icebergs
The front door stood hospitably open in expectation of company and an orderly vine grew at each side but our path led to the kitchen door at the houseend and there grew a mass of gay flowers and greenery as if they had been swept together by some diligent garden broom into a tangled heap there were portulacas all along under the lower step and straggling off into the grass and clustering mallows that crept as near as they dared like poor relations
I saw the bright eyes and brainless little heads of two halfgrown chickens who were snuggled down among the mallows as if they had been chased away from the door more than once and expected to be again
It seems kind o formal comin in this way said Mrs Todd impulsively as we passed the flowers and came to the front doorstep but she was mindful of the proprieties and walked before us into the best room on the left
Why mother if you havent gone an turned the carpet
she exclaimed with something in her voice that spoke of awe and admiration
Whend you get to it
I spose Mis Addicks come over an helped you from White Island Landing
No she didnt answered the old woman standing proudly erect and making the most of a great moment
I done it all myself with Williams help
He had a spare day an took right holt with me an twas all well beat on the grass an turned an put down again afore we went to bed
I ripped an sewed over two o them long breadths
I aint had such a good nights sleep for two years
There what do you think o havin such a mother as that for eightysix year old
said Mrs Todd standing before us like a large figure of Victory
As for the mother she took on a sudden look of youth you felt as if she promised a great future and was beginning not ending her summers and their happy toils
My my
exclaimed Mrs Todd
I couldnt ha done it myself Ive got to own it
I was much pleased to have it off my mind said Mrs Blackett humbly the more so because along at the first of the next week I wasnt very well
I suppose it may have been the change of weather
Mrs Todd could not resist a significant glance at me but with charming sympathy she forbore to point the lesson or to connect this illness with its apparent cause
She loomed larger than ever in the little oldfashioned best room with its few pieces of good furniture and pictures of national interest
The green paper curtains were stamped with conventional landscapes of a foreign ordercastles on inaccessible crags and lovely lakes with steep wooded shores underfoot the treasured carpet was covered thick with homemade rugs
There were empty glass lamps and crystallized bouquets of grass and some fine shells on the narrow mantelpiece
I was married in this room said Mrs Todd unexpectedly and I heard her give a sigh after she had spoken as if she could not help the touch of regret that would forever come with all her thoughts of happiness
We stood right there between the windows she added and the minister stood here
William wouldnt come in
He was always odd about seein folks justs he is now
I run to meet em from a child an William hed take an run away
Ive been the gainer said the old mother cheerfully
William has been son an daughter both since you was married off the island
Hes been most too satisfied to stop at home long o his old mother but I always tell em Im the gainer
We were all moving toward the kitchen as if by common instinct
The best room was too suggestive of serious occasions and the shades were all pulled down to shut out the summer light and air
It was indeed a tribute to Society to find a room set apart for her behests out there on so apparently neighborless and remote an island
Afternoon visits and evening festivals must be few in such a bleak situation at certain seasons of the year but Mrs Blackett was of those who do not live to themselves and who have long since passed the line that divides mere selfconcern from a valued share in whatever Society can give and take
There were those of her neighbors who never had taken the trouble to furnish a best room but Mrs Blackett was one who knew the uses of a parlor
Yes do come right out into the old kitchen I shant make any stranger of you she invited us pleasantly after we had been properly received in the room appointed to formality
I expect Almiry here ll be driftin out mongst the pastureweeds quicks she can find a good excuse
Tis hot now
Youd better content yourselves till you get nice an rested an long after dinner the seabreeze ll spring up an then you can take your walks an go up an see the prospect from the big ledge
Almiryll want to show off everything there is
Then Ill get you a good cup o tea before you start to go home
The days are plenty long now
While we were talking in the best room the selected fish had been mysteriously brought up from the shore and lay all cleaned and ready in an earthen crock on the table
I think William might have just stopped an said a word remarked Mrs Todd pouting with high affront as she caught sight of it
Hes friendly enough when he comes ashore an was remarkable social the last time for him
He aint disposed to be very social with the ladies explained Williams mother with a delightful glance at me as if she counted upon my friendship and tolerance
Hes very particular and hes all in his old fishinclothes today
Hell want me to tell him everything you said and done after youve gone
William has very deep affections
Hell want to see you Almiry
Yes I guess hell be in by an by
Ill search for him by n by if he dont proclaimed Mrs Todd with an air of unalterable resolution
I know all of his burrows down long the shore
Ill catch him by hand fore he knows it
Ive got some business with William anyway
I brought fortytwo cents with me that was due him for them last lobsters he brought in
You can leave it with me suggested the little old mother who was already stepping about among her pots and pans in the pantry and preparing to make the chowder
I became possessed of a sudden unwonted curiosity in regard to William and felt that half the pleasure of my visit would be lost if I could not make his interesting acquaintance
IX William MRS TODD HAD taken the onion out of her basket and laid it down upon the kitchen table
Theres Johnny Bowden come with us you know she reminded her mother
Hell be hungry enough to eat his size
Ive got new doughnuts dear said the little old lady
You dont often catch William n me out o provisions
I expect you might have chose a somewhat larger fish but Ill try an make it do
I shall have to have a few extra potatoes but theres a field full out there an the hoes leanin against the wellhouse in mongst the climbinbeans
She smiled and gave her daughter a commanding nod
Land sakes alive
Les blow the horn for William insisted Mrs Todd with some excitement
He neednt break his spirit so fars to come in
Hell know you need him for something particular an then we can call to him as he comes up the path
I wont put him to no pain
Mrs Blacketts old face for the first time wore a look of trouble and I found it necessary to counteract the teasing spirit of Almira
It was too pleasant to stay indoors altogether even in such rewarding companionship besides I might meet William and straying out presently I found the hoe by the wellhouse and an old splint basket at the woodshed door and also found my way down to the field where there was a great square patch of rough weedy potatotops and tall ragweed
One corner was already dug and I chose a fatlooking hill where the tops were well withered
There is all the pleasure that one can have in golddigging in finding ones hopes satisfied in the riches of a good hill of potatoes
I longed to go on but it did not seem frugal to dig any longer after my basket was full and at last I took my hoe by the middle and lifted the basket to go back up the hill
I was sure that Mrs Blackett must be waiting impatiently to slice the potatoes into the chowder layer after layer with the fish
You let me take holt o that basket maam said the pleasant anxious voice behind me
I turned startled in the silence of the wide field and saw an elderly man bent in the shoulders as fishermen often are gray headed and cleanshaven and with a timid air
It was William
He looked just like his mother and I had been imagining that he was large and stout like his sister Almira Todd and strange to say my fancy had led me to picture him not far from thirty and a little loutish
It was necessary instead to pay William the respect due to age
I accustomed myself to plain facts on the instant and we said goodmorning like old friends
The basket was really heavy and I put the hoe through its handle and offered him one end then we moved easily toward the house together speaking of the fine weather and of mackerel which were reported to be striking in all about the bay
William had been out since three oclock and had taken an extra fare of fish
I could feel that Mrs Todds eyes were upon us as we approached the house and although I fell behind in the narrow path and let William take the basket alone and precede me at some little distance the rest of the way I could plainly hear her greet him
Got round to comin in didnt you
she inquired with amusement
Well now thats clever
Didnt knows I should see you today William an I wanted to settle an account
I felt somewhat disturbed and responsible but when I joined them they were on most simple and friendly terms
It became evident that with William it was the first step that cost and that having once joined in social interests he was able to pursue them with more or less pleasure
He was about sixty and not younglooking for his years yet so undying is the spirit of youth and bashfulness has such a power of survival that I felt all the time as if one must try to make the occasion easy for some one who was young and new to the affairs of social life
He asked politely if I would like to go up to the great ledge while dinner was getting ready so not without a deep sense of pleasure and a delighted look of surprise from the two hostesses we started William and I as if both of us felt much younger than we looked
Such was the innocence and simplicity of the moment that when I heard Mrs Todd laughing behind us in the kitchen I laughed too but William did not even blush
I think he was a little deaf and he stepped along before me most businesslike and intent upon his errand
We went from the upper edge of the field above the house into a smooth brown path among the dark spruces
The hot sun brought out the fragrance of the pitchy bark and the shade was pleasant as we climbed the hill
William stopped once or twice to show me a great waspsnest close by or some fishhawksnests below in a bit of swamp
He picked a few sprigs of lateblooming linnaea as we came out upon an open bit of pasture at the top of the island and gave them to me without speaking but he knew as well as I that one could not say half he wished about linnaea
Through this piece of rough pasture ran a huge shape of stone like the great backbone of an enormous creature
At the end near the woods we could climb up on it and walk along to the highest point there above the circle of pointed firs we could look down over all the island and could see the ocean that circled this and a hundred other bits of island ground the mainland shore and all the far horizons
It gave a sudden sense of space for nothing stopped the eye or hedged one inthat sense of liberty in space and time which great prospects always give
There aint no such view in the world I expect said William proudly and I hastened to speak my heartfelt tribute of praise it was impossible not to feel as if an untraveled boy had spoken and yet one loved to have him value his native heath
X Where Pennyroyal Grew WE WERE a little late to dinner but Mrs Blackett and Mrs Todd were lenient and we all took our places after William had paused to wash his hands like a pious Brahmin at the well and put on a neat blue coat which he took from a peg behind the kitchen door
Then he resolutely asked a blessing in words that I could not hear and we ate the chowder and were thankful
The kitten went round and round the table quite erect and holding on by her fierce young claws she stopped to mew with pathos at each elbow or darted off to the open door when a song sparrow forgot himself and lit in the grass too near
William did not talk much but his sister Todd occupied the time and told all the news there was to tell of Dunnet Landing and its coasts while the old mother listened with delight
Her hospitality was something exquisite she had the gift which so many women lack of being able to make themselves and their houses belong entirely to a guests pleasurethat charming surrender for the moment of themselves and whatever belongs to them so that they make a part of ones own life that can never be forgotten
Tact is after all a kind of mindreading and my hostess held the golden gift
Sympathy is of the mind as well as the heart and Mrs Blacketts world and mine were one from the moment we met
Besides she had that final that highest gift of heaven a perfect selfforgetfulness
Sometimes as I watched her eager sweet old face I wondered why she had been set to shine on this lonely island of the northern coast
It must have been to keep the balance true and make up to all her scattered and depending neighbors for other things which they may have lacked
When we had finished clearing away the old blue plates and the kitten had taken care of her share of the fresh haddock just as we were putting back the kitchen chairs in their places Mrs Todd said briskly that she must go up into the pasture now to gather the desired herbs
You can stop here an rest or you can accompany me she announced
Mother ought to have her nap and when we come back she an Williamll sing for you
She admires music said Mrs Todd turning to speak to her mother
But Mrs Blackett tried to say that she couldnt sing as she used and perhaps William wouldnt feel like it
She looked tired the good old soul or I should have liked to sit in the peaceful little house while she slept I had had much pleasant experience of pastures already in her daughters company
But it seemed best to go with Mrs Todd and off we went
Mrs Todd carried the gingham bag which she had brought from home and a small heavy burden in the bottom made it hang straight and slender from her hand
The way was steep and she soon grew breathless so that we sat down to rest awhile on a convenient large stone among the bayberry
There I wanted you to see thistis mothers picture said Mrs Todd twas taken once when she was up to Portland soon after she was married
Thats me she added opening another worn case and displaying the full face of the cheerful child she looked like still in spite of being past sixty
And heres William an father together
I take after father large and heavy an William is like mothers folks short an thin
He ought to have made something o himself bein a man an so like mother but though hes been very steady to work an kept up the farm an done his fishin too right along he never had mothers snap an power o seein things just as they be
Hes got excellent judgment too meditated Williams sister but she could not arrive at any satisfactory decision upon what she evidently thought his failure in life
I think it is well to see any one so happy an makin the most of life just as it falls to hand she said as she began to put the daguerreotypes away again but I reached out my hand to see her mothers once more a most flowerlike face of a lovely young woman in quaint dress
There was in the eyes a look of anticipation and joy a faroff look that sought the horizon one often sees it in seafaring families inherited by girls and boys alike from men who spend their lives at sea and are always watching for distant sails or the first loom of the land
At sea there is nothing to be seen close by and this has its counterpart in a sailors character in the large and brave and patient traits that are developed the hopeful pleasantness that one loves so in a seafarer
When the family pictures were wrapped again in a big handkerchief we set forward in a narrow footpath and made our way to a lonely place that faced northward where there was more pasturage and fewer bushes and we went down to the edge of short grass above some rocky cliffs where the deep sea broke with a great noise though the wind was down and the water looked quiet a little way from shore
Among the grass grew such pennyroyal as the rest of the world could not provide
There was a fine fragrance in the air as we gathered it sprig by sprig and stepped along carefully and Mrs Todd pressed her aromatic nosegay between her hands and offered it to me again and again
Theres nothin like it she said oh no theres no such pennyryal as this in the state of Maine
Its the right pattern of the plant and all the rest I ever see is but an imitation
Dont it do you good
And I answered with enthusiasm
There dear I never showed nobody else but mother where to find this place tis kind of sainted to me
Nathan my husband an I used to love this place when we was courtin andshe hesitated and then spoke softlywhen he was lost twas just off shore tryin to get in by the short channel out there between Squaw Islands right in sight o this headland where wed set an made our plans all summer long
I had never heard her speak of her husband before but I felt that we were friends now since she had brought me to this place
Twas but a dream with us Mrs Todd said
I knew it when he was gone
I knew itand she whispered as if she were at confessionI knew it afore he started to go to sea
My heart was gone out o my keepin before I ever saw Nathan but he loved me well and he made me real happy and he died before he ever knew what hed had to know if wed lived long together
Tis very strange about love
No Nathan never found out but my heart was troubled when I knew him first
Theres more women likes to be loved than there is of those that loves
I spent some happy hours right here
I always liked Nathan and he never knew
But this pennyryal always reminded me as Id sit and gather it and hear him talkinit always would remind me ofthe other one
She looked away from me and presently rose and went on by herself
There was something lonely and solitary about her great determined shape
She might have been Antigone alone on the Theban plain
It is not often given in a noisy world to come to the places of great grief and silence
An absolute archaic grief possessed this countrywoman she seemed like a renewal of some historic soul with her sorrows and the remoteness of a daily life busied with rustic simplicities and the scents of primeval herbs
I was not incompetent at herbgathering and after a while when I had sat long enough waking myself to new thoughts and reading a page of remembrance with new pleasure I gathered some bunches as I was bound to do and at last we met again higher up the shore in the plain everyday world we had left behind when we went down to the pennyroyal plot
As we walked together along the high edge of the field we saw a hundred sails about the bay and farther seaward it was midafternoon or after and the day was coming to an end
Yes theyre all makin towards the shorethe small craft an the lobster smacks an all said my companion
We must spend a little time with mother now just to have our tea an then put for home
No matter if we lose the wind at sundown I can row in with Johnny said I and Mrs Todd nodded reassuringly and kept to her steady plod not quickening her gait even when we saw William come round the corner of the house as if to look for us and wave his hand and disappear
Why Williams right on deck I didnt knows we should see any more of him
exclaimed Mrs Todd
Now motherll put the kettle right on shes got a good fire goin
I too could see the blue smoke thicken and then we both walked a little faster while Mrs Todd groped in her full bag of herbs to find the daguerreotypes and be ready to put them in their places
XI The Old Singers WILLIAM WAS sitting on the side door step and the old mother was busy making her tea she gave into my hand an old floweredglass teacaddy
William thought youd like to see this when he was settin the table
My father brought it to my mother from the island of Tobago an heres a pair of beautiful mugs that came with it
She opened the glass door of a little cupboard beside the chimney
These I call my best things dear she said
Youd laugh to see how we enjoy em Sunday nights in winter we have a real company tea stead o livin right along just the same an I make somethin good for a sprise an put on some o my preserves an we get atalkin together an have real pleasant times
Mrs Todd laughed indulgently and looked to see what I thought of such childishness
I wish I could be here some Sunday evening said I
William an mell be talkin about you an thinkin o this nice day said Mrs Blackett affectionately and she glanced at William and he looked up bravely and nodded
I began to discover that he and his sister could not speak their deeper feelings before each other
Now I want you an mother to sing said Mrs Todd abruptly with an air of command and I gave William much sympathy in his evident distress
After Ive had my cup o tea dear answered the old hostess cheerfully and so we sat down and took our cups and made merry while they lasted
It was impossible not to wish to stay on forever at Green Island and I could not help saying so
Im very happy here both winter an summer said old Mrs Blackett
William an I never wish for any other home do we William
Im glad you find it pleasant I wish youd come an stay dear whenever you feel inclined
But heres Almiry I always think Providence was kind to plot an have her husband leave her a good house where she really belonged
Shed been very restless if shed had to continue here on Green Island
You wanted more scope didnt you Almiry an to live in a large place where more things grew
Sometimes folks wonders that we dont live together perhaps we shall some time and a shadow of sadness and apprehension flitted across her face
The time o sickness an failin has got to come to all
But Almirys got an herb thats good for everything
She smiled as she spoke and looked bright again
Theres some herb thats good for everybody except for them that thinks theyre sick when they aint announced Mrs Todd with a truly professional air of finality
Come William lets have Sweet Home an then motherll sing Cupid an the Bee for us
Then followed a most charming surprise
William mastered his timidity and began to sing
His voice was a little faint and frail like the family daguerreotypes but it was a tenor voice and perfectly true and sweet
I have never heard Home Sweet Home sung as touchingly and seriously as he sang it he seemed to make it quite new and when he paused for a moment at the end of the first line and began the next the old mother joined him and they sang together she missing only the higher notes where he seemed to lend his voice to hers for the moment and carry on her very note and air
It was the silent mans real and only means of expression and one could have listened forever and have asked for more and more songs of old Scotch and English inheritance and the best that have lived from the ballad music of the war
Mrs Todd kept time visibly and sometimes audibly with her ample foot
I saw the tears in her eyes sometimes when I could see beyond the tears in mine
But at last the songs ended and the time came to say goodby it was the end of a great pleasure
Mrs Blackett the dear old lady opened the door of her bedroom while Mrs Todd was tying up the herb bag and William had gone down to get the boat ready and to blow the horn for Johnny Bowden who had joined a roving boat party who were off the shore lobstering
I went to the door of the bedroom and thought how pleasant it looked with its pinkandwhite patchwork quilt and the brown unpainted paneling of its woodwork
Come right in dear she said
I want you to set down in my old quilted rockinchair there by the window youll say its the prettiest view in the house
I set there a good deal to rest me and when I want to read
There was a worn red Bible on the lightstand and Mrs Blacketts heavy silverbowed glasses her thimble was on the narrow windowledge and folded carefully on the table was a thick stripedcotton shirt that she was making for her son
Those dear old fingers and their loving stitches that heart which had made the most of everything that needed love
Here was the real home the heart of the old house on Green Island
I sat in the rocking chair and felt that it was a place of peace the little brown bedroom and the quiet outlook upon field and sea and sky
I looked up and we understood each other without speaking
I shall like to think o your settin here today said Mrs Blackett
I want you to come again
It has been so pleasant for William
The wind served us all the way home and did not fall or let the sail slacken until we were close to the shore
We had a generous freight of lobsters in the boat and new potatoes which William had put aboard and what Mrs Todd proudly called a full kag of prime number one salted mackerel and when we landed we had to make business arrangements to have these conveyed to her house in a wheelbarrow
I never shall forget the day at Green Island
The town of Dunnet Landing seemed large and noisy and oppressive as we came ashore
Such is the power of contrast for the village was so still that I could hear the shy whippoorwills singing that night as I lay awake in my downstairs bedroom and the scent of Mrs Todds herb garden under the window blew in again and again with every gentle rising of the seabreeze
XII A Strange Sail EXCEPT FOR a few stray guests islanders or from the inland country to whom Mrs Todd offered the hospitalities of a single meal we were quite by ourselves all summer and when there were signs of invasion late in July and a certain Mrs Fosdick appeared like a strange sail on the far horizon I suffered much from apprehension
I had been living in the quaint little house with as much comfort and unconsciousness as if it were a larger body or a double shell in whose simple convolutions Mrs Todd and I had secreted ourselves until some wandering hermit crab of a visitor marked the little spare room for her own
Perhaps now and then a castaway on a lonely desert island dreads the thought of being rescued
I heard of Mrs Fosdick for the first time with a selfish sense of objection but after all I was still vacation tenant of the schoolhouse where I could always be alone and it was impossible not to sympathize with Mrs Todd who in spite of some preliminary grumbling was really delighted with the prospect of entertaining an old friend
For nearly a month we received occasional news of Mrs Fosdick who seemed to be making a royal progress from house to house in the inland neighborhood after the fashion of Queen Elizabeth
One Sunday after another came and went disappointing Mrs Todd in the hope of seeing her guest at church and fixing the day for the great visit to begin but Mrs Fosdick was not ready to commit herself to a date
An assurance of some time this week was not sufficiently definite from a freefooted housekeepers point of view and Mrs Todd put aside all herbgathering plans and went through the various stages of expectation provocation and despair
At last she was ready to believe that Mrs Fosdick must have forgotten her promise and returned to her home which was vaguely said to be over Thomaston way
But one evening just as the suppertable was cleared and readied up and Mrs Todd had put her large apron over her head and stepped forth for an evening stroll in the garden the unexpected happened
She heard the sound of wheels and gave an excited cry to me as I sat by the window that Mrs Fosdick was coming right up the street
She may not be considerate but shes dreadful good company said Mrs Todd hastily coming back a few steps from the neighborhood of the gate
No she aint a mite considerate but theres a small lobster left over from your tea yes its a real mercy theres a lobster
Susan Fosdick might just as well have passed the compliment o comin an hour ago
Perhaps she has had her supper I ventured to suggest sharing the housekeepers anxiety and meekly conscious of an inconsiderate appetite for my own supper after a long expedition up the bay
There were so few emergencies of any sort at Dunnet Landing that this one appeared overwhelming
No shes rode way over from Nahum Braytons place
I expect they were busy on the farm and couldnt spare the horse in proper season
You just sly out an set the teakittle on again dear an drop in a good hanful o chips the fires all alive
Ill take her right up to lay off her things as shell be occupied with explanations an gettin her bunnit off so youll have plenty o time
Shes one I shouldnt like to have find me unprepared
Mrs Fosdick was already at the gate and Mrs Todd now turned with an air of complete surprise and delight to welcome her
Why Susan Fosdick I heard her exclaim in a fine unhindered voice as if she were calling across a field I come near giving of you up
I was afraid youd gone an portioned out my visit to somebody else
I spose youve been to supper
Lor no I aint Almiry Todd said Mrs Fosdick cheerfully as she turned laden with bags and bundles from making her adieux to the boy driver
I aint had a mite o supper dear
Ive been lottin all the way on a cup o that best tea o yourn some o that Oolong you keep in the little chist
I dont want none o your useful herbs
I keep that tea for ministers folks gayly responded Mrs Todd
Come right along in Susan Fosdick
I declare if you aint the same old sixpence
As they came up the walk together laughing like girls I fled full of cares to the kitchen to brighten the fire and be sure that the lobster sole dependence of a late supper was well out of reach of the cat
There proved to be fine reserves of wild raspberries and bread and butter so that I regained my composure and waited impatiently for my own share of this illustrious visit to begin
There was an instant sense of high festivity in the evening air from the moment when our guest had so frankly demanded the Oolong tea
The great moment arrived
I was formally presented at the stairfoot and the two friends passed on to the kitchen where I soon heard a hospitable clink of crockery and the brisk stirring of a teacup
I sat in my highbacked rockingchair by the window in the front room with an unreasonable feeling of being left out like the child who stood at the gate in Hans Andersens story
Mrs Fosdick did not look at first sight like a person of great social gifts
She was a seriouslooking little bit of an old woman with a birdlike nod of the head
I had often been told that she was the best hand in the world to make a visitas if to visit were the highest of vocations that everybody wished for her while few could get her and I saw that Mrs Todd felt a comfortable sense of distinction in being favored with the company of this eminent person who knew just how
It was certainly true that Mrs Fosdick gave both her hostess and me a warm feeling of enjoyment and expectation as if she had the power of social suggestion to all neighboring minds
The two friends did not reappear for at least an hour
I could hear their busy voices loud and low by turns as they ranged from public to confidential topics
At last Mrs Todd kindly remembered me and returned giving my door a ceremonious knock before she stepped in with the small visitor in her wake
She reached behind her and took Mrs Fosdicks hand as if she were young and bashful and gave her a gentle pull forward
There I dont know whether youre goin to take to each other or not no nobody cant tell whether youll suit each other but I expect youll get along some way both having seen the world said our affectionate hostess
You can inform Mis Fosdick how we found the folks out to Green Island the other day
Shes always been well acquainted with mother
Ill slip out now an put away the supper things an set my bread to rise if youll both excuse me
You can come an keep me company when you get ready either or both
And Mrs Todd large and amiable disappeared and left us
Being furnished not only with a subject of conversation but with a safe refuge in the kitchen in case of incompatibility Mrs Fosdick and I sat down prepared to make the best of each other
I soon discovered that she like many of the elder women of the coast had spent a part of her life at sea and was full of a good travelers curiosity and enlightenment
By the time we thought it discreet to join our hostess we were already sincere friends
You may speak of a visits setting in as well as a tides and it was impossible as Mrs Todd whispered to me not to be pleased at the way this visit was setting in a new impulse and refreshing of the social currents and seldom visited bays of memory appeared to have begun
Mrs Fosdick had been the mother of a large family of sons and daughterssailors and sailors wives and most of them had died before her
I soon grew more or less acquainted with the histories of all their fortunes and misfortunes and subjects of an intimate nature were no more withheld from my ears than if I had been a shell on the mantelpiece
Mrs Fosdick was not without a touch of dignity and elegance she was fashionable in her dress but it was a curiously wellpreserved provincial fashion of some years back
In a wider sphere one might have called her a woman of the world with her unexpected bits of modern knowledge but Mrs Todds wisdom was an intimation of truth itself
She might belong to any age like an idyl of Theocritus but while she always understood Mrs Fosdick that entertaining pilgrim could not always understand Mrs Todd
That very first evening my friends plunged into a borderless sea of reminiscences and personal news
Mrs Fosdick had been staying with a family who owned the farm where she was born and she had visited every sunny knoll and shady field corner but when she said that it might be for the last time I detected in her tone something expectant of the contradiction which Mrs Todd promptly offered
Almiry said Mrs Fosdick with sadness you may say what you like but I am one of nine brothers and sisters brought up on the old place and were all dead but me
Your sister Dailey aint gone is she
Why no Louisa aint gone
exclaimed Mrs Todd with surprise
Why I never heard of that occurrence
Yesm she passed away last October in Lynn
She had made her distant home in Vermont State but she was making a visit to her youngest daughter
Louisa was the only one of my family whose funeral I wasnt able to attend but twas a mere accident
All the rest of us were settled right about home
I thought it was very slack of em in Lynn not to fetch her to the old place but when I came to hear about it I learned that theyd recently put up a very elegant monument and my sister Dailey was always great for show
Shed just been out to see the monument the week before she was taken down and admired it so much that they felt sure of her wishes
So shes really gone and the funeral was up to Lynn
repeated Mrs Todd as if to impress the sad fact upon her mind
She was some years younger than we be too
I recollect the first day she ever came to school twas that first year mother sent me inshore to stay with aunt Tophams folks and get my schooling
You fetched little Louisa to school one Monday mornin in a pink dress an her long curls and she set between you an me and got cryin after a while so the teacher sent us home with her at recess
She was scared of seeing so many children about her there was only her and me and brother John at home then the older boys were to sea with father an the rest of us want born explained Mrs Fosdick
That next fall we all went to sea together
Mother was uncertain till the last minute as one may say
The ship was waiting orders but the baby that then was was born just in time and there was a long spell of extra bad weather so mother got about again before they had to sail an we all went
I remember my clothes were all left ashore in the east chamber in a basket where motherd took them out o my chist o drawers an left em ready to carry aboard
She didnt have nothing aboard of her own that she wanted to cut up for me so when my dress wore out she just put me into a spare suit o Johns jacket and trousers
I wasnt but eight years old an he was most seven and large of his age
Quick as we made a port she went right ashore an fitted me out pretty but we was bound for the East Indies and didnt put in anywhere for a good while
So I had quite a spell o freedom
Mother made my new skirt long because I was growing and I poked about the deck after that real discouraged feeling the hem at my heels every minute and as if youth was past and gone
I liked the trousers best I used to climb the riggin with em and frighten mother till she said an vowed shed never take me to sea again
I thought by the polite absentminded smile on Mrs Todds face this was no new story
Little Louisa was a beautiful child yes I always thought Louisa was very pretty Mrs Todd said
She was a dear little girl in those days
She favored your mother the rest of you took after your fathers folks
We did certain agreed Mrs Fosdick rocking steadily
There it does seem so pleasant to talk with an old acquaintance that knows what you know
I see so many of these new folks nowadays that seem to have neither past nor future
Conversations got to have some root in the past or else youve got to explain every remark you make an it wears a person out
Mrs Todd gave a funny little laugh
Yesm old friends is always best less you can catch a new one thats fit to make an old one out of she said and we gave an affectionate glance at each other which Mrs Fosdick could not have understood being the latest comer to the house
XIII Poor Joanna ONE EVENING my ears caught a mysterious allusion which Mrs Todd made to Shellheap Island
It was a chilly night of cold northeasterly rain and I made a fire for the first time in the Franklin stove in my room and begged my two housemates to come in and keep me company
The weather had convinced Mrs Todd that it was time to make a supply of coughdrops and she had been bringing forth herbs from dark and dry hidingplaces until now the pungent dust and odor of them had resolved themselves into one mighty flavor of spearmint that came from a simmering caldron of syrup in the kitchen
She called it done and well done and had ostentatiously left it to cool and taken her knittingwork because Mrs Fosdick was busy with hers
They sat in the two rocking chairs the small woman and the large one but now and then I could see that Mrs Todds thoughts remained with the coughdrops
The time of gathering herbs was nearly over but the time of syrups and cordials had begun
The heat of the open fire made us a little drowsy but something in the way Mrs Todd spoke of Shellheap Island waked my interest
I waited to see if she would say any more and then took a roundabout way back to the subject by saying what was first in my mind that I wished the Green Island family were there to spend the evening with usMrs Todds mother and her brother William
Mrs Todd smiled and drummed on the arm of the rockingchair
Might scare William to death she warned me and Mrs Fosdick mentioned her intention of going out to Green Island to stay two or three days if the wind didnt make too much sea
Where is Shellheap Island
I ventured to ask seizing the opportunity
Bears noreast somewheres about three miles from Green Island right offshore I should call it about eight miles out said Mrs Todd
You never was there dear tis off the thoroughfares and a very bad place to land at best
I should think twas agreed Mrs Fosdick smoothing down her black silk apron
Tis a place worth visitin when you once get there
Some o the old folks was kind o fearful about it
Twas counted a great place in old Indian times you can pick up their stone tools most any time if you hunt about
Theres a beautiful spring o water too
Yes I remember when they used to tell queer stories about Shellheap Island
Some said twas a great bangeingplace for the Indians and an old chief resided there once that ruled the winds and others said theyd always heard that once the Indians come down from up country an left a captive there without any bot an twas too far to swim across to Black Island so called an he lived there till he perished
Ive heard say he walked the island after that and sharp sighted folks could see him an lose him like one o them citizens Capn Littlepage was acquainted with up to the north pole announced Mrs Todd grimly
Anyway there was Indiansyou can see their shellheap that named the island and Ive heard myself that twas one o their cannibal places but I never could believe it
There never was no cannibals on the coast o Maine
All the Indians o these regions are tamelooking folks
Sakes alive yes
exclaimed Mrs Fosdick
Ought to see them painted savages Ive seen when I was young out in the South Sea Islands
That was the time for folks to travel way back in the old whalin days
Whalin must have been dull for a lady hardly ever makin a lively port and not takin in any mixed cargoes said Mrs Todd
I never desired to go a whalin vyge myself
I used to return feelin very slack an behind the times tis true explained Mrs Fosdick but twas excitin an we always done extra well and felt rich when we did get ashore
I liked the variety
There how times have changed how few seafarin families there are left
What a lot o queer folks there used to be about here anyway when we was young Almiry
Everybodys just like everybody else now nobody to laugh about and nobody to cry about
It seemed to me that there were peculiarities of character in the region of Dunnet Landing yet but I did not like to interrupt
Yes said Mrs Todd after a moment of meditation there was certain a good many curiosities of human natur in this neighborhood years ago
There was more energy then and in some the energy took a singular turn
In these days the young folks is all copycats fraid to death they wont be all just alike as for the old folks they pray for the advantage o bein a little different
I aint heard of a copycat this great many years said Mrs Fosdick laughing twas a favorite term o my grandfathers
No I want thinking o those things but of them strange straying creaturs that used to rove the country
You dont see them now or the ones that used to hive away in their own houses with some strange notion or other
I thought again of Captain Littlepage but my companions were not reminded of his name and there was brother William at Green Island whom we all three knew
I was talking o poor Joanna the other day
I hadnt thought of her for a great while said Mrs Fosdick abruptly
Mis Brayton an I recalled her as we sat together sewing
She was one o your peculiar persons want she
Speaking of such persons she turned to explain to me there was a sort of a nun or hermit person lived out there for years all alone on Shellheap Island
Miss Joanna Todd her name wasa cousin o Almirys late husband
I expressed my interest but as I glanced at Mrs Todd I saw that she was confused by sudden affectionate feeling and unmistakable desire for reticence
I never want to hear Joanna laughed about she said anxiously
Nor I answered Mrs Fosdick reassuringly
She was crossed in lovethat was all the matter to begin with but as I look back I can see that Joanna was one doomed from the first to fall into a melancholy
She retired from the world for good an all though she was a welloff woman
All she wanted was to get away from folks she thought she wasnt fit to live with anybody and wanted to be free
Shellheap Island come to her from her father and first thing folks knew shed gone off out there to live and left word she didnt want no company
Twas a bad place to get to unless the wind an tide were just right twas hard work to make a landing
What time of year was this
I asked
Very late in the summer said Mrs Fosdick
No I never could laugh at Joanna as some did
She set everything by the young man an they were going to marry in about a month when he got bewitched with a girl way up the bay and married her and went off to Massachusetts
He wasnt well thought ofthere were those who thought Joannas money was what had tempted him but shed given him her whole heart an she want so young as she had been
All her hopes were built on marryin an havin a real home and somebody to look to she acted just like a bird when its nest is spoilt
The day after she heard the news she was in dreadful woe but the next she came to herself very quiet and took the horse and wagon and drove fourteen miles to the lawyers and signed a paper givin her half of the farm to her brother
They never had got along very well together but he didnt want to sign it till she acted so distressed that he gave in
Edward Todds wife was a good woman who felt very bad indeed and used every argument with Joanna but Joanna took a poor old boat that had been her fathers and loded in a few things and off she put all alone with a good land breeze right out to sea
Edward Todd ran down to the beach an stood there cryin like a boy to see her go but she was out o hearin
She never stepped foot on the mainland again long as she lived
How large an island is it
How did she manage in winter
I asked
Perhaps thirty acres rocks and all answered Mrs Todd taking up the story gravely
There cant be much of it that the salt spray dont fly over in storms
No tis a dreadful small place to make a world of it has a different look from any of the other islands but theres a sheltered cove on the south side with mudflats across one end of it at low water where theres excellent clams and the big shellheap keeps some o the wind off a little house her father took the trouble to build when he was a young man
They said there was an old house built o logs there before that with a kind of natural cellar in the rock under it
He used to stay out there days to a time and anchor a little sloop he had and dig clams to fill it and sail up to Portland
They said the dealers always gave him an extra price the clams were so noted
Joanna used to go out and stay with him
They were always great companions so she knew just what twas out there
There was a few sheep that belonged to her brother an her but she bargained for him to come and get them on the edge o cold weather
Yes she desired him to come for the sheep an his wife thought perhaps Joannad return but he said no an loded the bot with warm things an what he thought shed need through the winter
He come home with the sheep an left the other things by the house but she never so much as looked out o the window
She done it for a penance
She must have wanted to see Edward by that time
Mrs Fosdick was fidgeting with eagerness to speak
Some thought the first cold snap would set her ashore but she always remained concluded Mrs Todd soberly
Talk about the men not having any curiosity
exclaimed Mrs Fosdick scornfully
Why the waters round Shellheap Island were white with sails all that fall
Twas never called no great of a fishinground before
Many of em made excuse to go ashore to get water at the spring but at last she spoke to a botload very dignified and calm and said that shed like it better if theyd make a practice of getting water to Black Island or somewheres else and leave her alone except in case of accident or trouble
But there was one man who had always set everything by her from a boy
Hed have married her if the other hadnt come about an spoilt his chance and he used to get close to the island before light on his way out fishin and throw a little bundle way up the green slope front o the house
His sister told me she happened to see the first time what a pretty choice he made o useful things that a woman would feel lost without
He stood off fishin and could see them in the grass all day though sometimes shed come out and walk right by them
There was other bots near out after mackerel
But early next morning his present was gone
He didnt presume too much but once he took her a nice firkin o things he got up to Portland and when spring come he landed her a hen and chickens in a nice little coop
There was a good many old friends had Joanna on their minds
Yes said Mrs Todd losing her sad reserve in the growing sympathy of these reminiscences
How everybody used to notice whether there was smoke out of the chimney
The Black Island folks could see her with their spyglass and if theyd ever missed getting some sign o life theyd have sent notice to her folks
But after the first year or two Joanna was more and more forgotten as an everyday charge
Folks lived very simple in those days you know she continued as Mrs Fosdicks knitting was taking much thought at the moment
I expect there was always plenty of driftwood thrown up and a poor failin patch of spruces covered all the north side of the island so she always had something to burn
She was very fond of workin in the garden ashore and that first summer she began to till the little field out there and raised a nice parcel o potatoes
She could fish o course and there was all her clams an lobsters
You can always live well in any wild place by the sea when youd starve to death up country except twas berry time
Joanna had berries out there blackberries at least and there was a few herbs in case she needed them
Mullein in great quantities and a plant o wormwood I remember seeing once when I stayed there long before she fled out to Shellheap
Yes I recall the wormwood which is always a planted herb so there must have been folks there before the Todds day
A growin bush makes the best gravestone I expect that wormwood always stood for somebodys solemn monument
Catnip too is a very endurin herb about an old place
But what I want to know is what she did for other things interrupted Mrs Fosdick
Almiry what did she do for clothin when she needed to replenish or risin for her bread or the piecebag that no woman can live long without
Or company suggested Mrs Todd
Joanna was one that loved her friends
There must have been a terrible sight o long winter evenins that first year
There was her hens suggested Mrs Fosdick after reviewing the melancholy situation
She never wanted the sheep after that first season
There want no proper pasture for sheep after the June grass was past and she ascertained the fact and couldnt bear to see them suffer but the chickens done well
I remember sailin by one spring afternoon an seein the coops out front o the house in the sun
How long was it before you went out with the minister
You were the first ones that ever really got ashore to see Joanna
I had been reflecting upon a state of society which admitted such personal freedom and a voluntary hermitage
There was something mediaeval in the behavior of poor Joanna Todd under a disappointment of the heart
The two women had drawn closer together and were talking on quite unconscious of a listener
Poor Joanna
said Mrs Todd again and sadly shook her head as if there were things one could not speak about
I called her a great fool declared Mrs Fosdick with spirit but I pitied her then and I pity her far more now
Some other minister would have been a great help to herone that preached selfforgetfulness and doin for others to cure our own ills but Parson Dimmick was a vague person well meanin but very numb in his feelins
I dont suppose at that troubled time Joanna could think of any way to mend her troubles except to run off and hide
Mother used to say she didnt see how Joanna lived without having nobody to do for getting her own meals and tending her own poor self day in an day out said Mrs Todd sorrowfully
There was the hens repeated Mrs Fosdick kindly
I expect she soon came to makin folks o them
No I never went to work to blame Joanna as some did
She was full o feeling and her troubles hurt her more than she could bear
I see it all now as I couldnt when I was young
I suppose in old times they had their shutup convents for just such folks said Mrs Todd as if she and her friend had disagreed about Joanna once and were now in happy harmony
She seemed to speak with new openness and freedom
Oh yes I was only too pleased when the Reverend Mr Dimmick invited me to go out with him
He hadnt been very long in the place when Joanna left home and friends
Twas one day that next summer after she went and I had been married early in the spring
He felt that he ought to go out and visit her
She was a member of the church and might wish to have him consider her spiritual state
I want so sure o that but I always liked Joanna and Id come to be her cousin by marriage
Nathan an I had conversed about goin out to pay her a visit but he got his chance to sail soonern he expected
He always thought everything of her and last time he come home knowing nothing of her change he brought her a beautiful coral pin from a port hed touched at somewheres up the Mediterranean
So I wrapped the little box in a nice piece of paper and put it in my pocket and picked her a bunch of fresh lemon balm and off we started
Mrs Fosdick laughed
I remember hearin about your trials on the vyge she said
Why yes continued Mrs Todd in her company manner
I picked her the balm an we started
Why yes Susan the minister liked to have cost me my life that day
He would fasten the sheet though I advised against it
He said the rope was rough an cut his hand
There was a fresh breeze an he went on talking rather high flown an I felt some interested
All of a sudden there come up a gust and he gave a screech and stood right up and called for help way out there to sea
I knocked him right over into the bottom o the bot getting by to catch hold of the sheet an untie it
He wasnt but a little man I helped him right up after the squall passed and made a handsome apology to him but he did act kind o offended
I do think they ought not to settle them landlocked folks in parishes where theyre liable to be on the water insisted Mrs Fosdick
Think of the families in our parish that was scattered all about the bay and what a sight o sails you used to see in Mr Dimmicks day standing across to the mainland on a pleasant Sunday morning filled with churchgoing folks all sure to want him some time or other
You couldnt find no doctor that would stand up in the boat and screech if a flaw struck her
Old Dr Bennett had a beautiful sailboat didnt he
responded Mrs Todd
And how well he used to brave the weather
Mother always said that in time o trouble that tall white sail used to look like an angels wing comin over the sea to them that was in pain
Well theres a difference in gifts
Mr Dimmick was not without light
Twas light o the moon then snapped Mrs Fosdick he was pompous enough but I never could remember a single word he said
There go on Mis Todd I forget a great deal about that day you went to see poor Joanna
I felt she saw us coming and knew us a great way off yes I seemed to feel it within me said our friend laying down her knitting
I kept my seat and took the bot inshore without saying a word there was a short channel that I was sure Mr Dimmick wasnt acquainted with and the tide was very low
She never came out to warn us off nor anything and I thought as I hauled the bot up on a wave and let the Reverend Mr Dimmick step out that it was somethin gained to be safe ashore
There was a little smoke out o the chimney o Joannas house and it did look sort of homelike and pleasant with wild morninglory vines trained up an there was a plot o flowers under the front window portulacas and things
I believe shed made a garden once when she was stopping there with her father and some things must have seeded in
It looked as if she might have gone over to the other side of the island
Twas neat and pretty all about the house and a lovely day in July
We walked up from the beach together very sedate and I felt for poor Nathans little pin to see if twas safe in my dress pocket
All of a sudden Joanna come right to the fore door and stood there not sayin a word
XIV The Hermitage MY COMPANION and I had been so intent upon the subject of the conversation that we had not heard any one open the gate but at this moment above the noise of the rain we heard a loud knocking
We were all startled as we sat by the fire and Mrs Todd rose hastily and went to answer the call leaving her rockingchair in violent motion
Mrs Fosdick and I heard an anxious voice at the door speaking of a sick child and Mrs Todds kind motherly voice inviting the messenger in then we waited in silence
There was a sound of heavy dropping of rain from the eaves and the distant roar and undertone of the sea
My thoughts flew back to the lonely woman on her outer island what separation from humankind she must have felt what terror and sadness even in a summer storm like this
You send right after the doctor if she aint better in half an hour said Mrs Todd to her worried customer as they parted and I felt a warm sense of comfort in the evident resources of even so small a neighborhood but for the poor hermit Joanna there was no neighbor on a winter night
How did she look
demanded Mrs Fosdick without preface as our large hostess returned to the little room with a mist about her from standing long in the wet doorway and the sudden draught of her coming beat out the smoke and flame from the Franklin stove
How did poor Joanna look
She was the same as ever except I thought she looked smaller answered Mrs Todd after thinking a moment perhaps it was only a last considering thought about her patient
Yes she was just the same and looked very nice Joanna did
I had been married since she left home an she treated me like her own folks
I expected shed look strange with her hair turned gray in a night or somethin but she wore a pretty gingham dress Id often seen her wear before she went away she must have kept it nice for best in the afternoons
She always had beautiful quiet manners
I remember she waited till we were close to her and then kissed me real affectionate and inquired for Nathan before she shook hands with the minister and then she invited us both in
Twas the same little house her father had built him when he was a bachelor with one livinroom and a little mite of a bedroom out of it where she slept but twas neat as a ships cabin
There was some old chairs an a seat made of a long box that might have held boat tackle an things to lock up in his fishin days and a good enough stove so anybody could cook and keep warm in cold weather
I went over once from home and stayed most a week with Joanna when we was girls and those young happy days rose up before me
Her father was busy all day fishin or clammin he was one o the pleasantest men in the world but Joannas mother had the grim streak and never knew what twas to be happy
The first minute my eyes fell upon Joannas face that day I saw how she had grown to look like Mis Todd
Twas the mother right over again
Oh dear me
said Mrs Fosdick
Joanna had done one thing very pretty
There was a little piece o swamp on the island where good rushes grew plenty and shed gathered em and braided some beautiful mats for the floor and a thick cushion for the long bunk
Shed showed a good deal of invention you see there was a nice chance to pick up pieces o wood and boards that drove ashore and shed made good use o what she found
There wasnt no clock but she had a few dishes on a shelf and flowers set about in shells fixed to the walls so it did look sort of homelike though so lonely and poor
I couldnt keep the tears out o my eyes I felt so sad
I said to myself I must get mother to come over an see Joanna the love in mothers heart would warm her an she might be able to advise
Oh no Joanna was dreadful stern said Mrs Fosdick
We were all settin down very proper but Joanna would keep stealin glances at me as if she was glad I come
She had but little to say she was real polite an gentle and yet forbiddin
The minister found it hard confessed Mrs Todd he got embarrassed an when he put on his authority and asked her if she felt to enjoy religion in her present situation an she replied that she must be excused from answerin I thought I should fly
She might have made it easier for him after all he was the minister and had taken some trouble to come out though twas kind of cold an unfeelin the way he inquired
I thought he might have seen the little old Bible alayin on the shelf close by him an I wished he knew enough to just lay his hand on it an read somethin kind an fatherly stead of accusin her an then given poor Joanna his blessin with the hope she might be led to comfort
He did offer prayer but twas all about hearin the voice o God out o the whirlwind and I thought while he was goin on that anybody that had spent the long cold winter all alone out on Shell heap Island knew a good deal more about those things than he did
I got so provoked I opened my eyes and stared right at him
She didnt take no notice she kep a nice respectful manner towards him and when there come a pause she asked if he had any interest about the old Indian remains and took down some queer stone gouges and hammers off of one of her shelves and showed them to him sames if he was a boy
He remarked that hed like to walk over an see the shellheap so she went right to the door and pointed him the way
I see then that shed made her some kind o sandalshoes out o the fine rushes to wear on her feet she stepped light an nice in em as shoes
Mrs Fosdick leaned back in her rockingchair and gave a heavy sigh
I didnt move at first but Id held out just as long as I could said Mrs Todd whose voice trembled a little
When Joanna returned from the door an I could see that mans stupid back departin among the wild rose bushes I just ran to her an caught her in my arms
I wasnt so big as I be now and she was older than me but I hugged her tight just as if she was a child
Oh Joanna dear I says wont you come ashore an live long o me at the Landin or go over to Green Island to mothers when winter comes
Nobody shall trouble you an mother finds it hard bein alone
I cant bear to leave you hereand I burst right out crying
Id had my own trials young as I was an she knew it
Oh I did entreat her yes I entreated Joanna
What did she say then
asked Mrs Fosdick much moved
She looked the same way sad an remote through it all said Mrs Todd mournfully
She took hold of my hand and we sat down close together twas as if she turned round an made a child of me
I havent got no right to live with folks no more she said
You must never ask me again Almiry Ive done the only thing I could do and Ive made my choice
I feel a great comfort in your kindness but I dont deserve it
I have committed the unpardonable sin you dont understand says she humbly
I was in great wrath and trouble and my thoughts was so wicked towards God that I cant expect ever to be forgiven
I have come to know what it is to have patience but I have lost my hope
You must tell those that ask how tis with me she said an tell them I want to be alone
I couldnt speak no there want anything I could say she seemed so above everything common
I was a good deal younger then than I be now and I got Nathans little coral pin out o my pocket and put it into her hand and when she saw it and I told her where it come from her face did really light up for a minute sort of bright an pleasant
Nathan an I was always good friends Im glad he dont think hard of me says she
I want you to have it Almiry an wear it for love o both o us and she handed it back to me
You give my love to Nathan hes a dear good man she said an tell your mother if I should be sick she mustnt wish I could get well but I want her to be the one to come
Then she seemed to have said all she wanted to as if she was done with the world and we sat there a few minutes longer together
It was real sweet and quiet except for a good many birds and the sea rollin up on the beach but at last she rose an I did too and she kissed me and held my hand in hers a minute as if to say goodby then she turned and went right away out o the door and disappeared
The minister come back pretty soon and I told him I was all ready and we started down to the bot
He had picked up some round stones and things and was carrying them in his pocket handkerchief an he sat down amidships without making any question and let me take the rudder an work the bot an made no remarks for some time until we sort of eased it off speaking of the weather an subjects that arose as we skirted Black Island where two or three families lived belongin to the parish
He preached next Sabbath as usual somethin high soundin about the creation and I couldnt help thinkin he might never get no further he seemed to know no remedies but he had a great use of words
Mrs Fosdick sighed again
Hearin you tell about Joanna brings the time right back as if twas yesterday she said
Yes she was one o them poor things that talked about the great sin we dont seem to hear nothing about the unpardonable sin now but you may say twas not uncommon then
I expect that if it had been in these days such a person would be plagued to death with idle folks continued Mrs Todd after a long pause
As it was nobody trespassed on her all the folks about the bay respected her an her feelings but as time wore on after you left here one after another ventured to make occasion to put somethin ashore for her if they went that way
I know mother used to go to see her sometimes and send William over now and then with something fresh an nice from the farm
There is a point on the sheltered side where you can lay a boat close to shore an land anything safe on the turf out o reach o the water
There were one or two others old folks that she would see and now an then shed hail a passin boat an ask for somethin and mother got her to promise that she would make some sign to the Black Island folks if she wanted help
I never saw her myself to speak to after that day
I expect nowadays if such a thing happened shed have gone out West to her uncles folks or up to Massachusetts and had a change an come home good as new
The worlds bigger an freer than it used to be urged Mrs Fosdick
No said her friend
Tis like bad eyesight the mind of such a person if your eyes dont see right there may be a remedy but theres no kind of glasses to remedy the mind
No Joanna was Joanna and there she lays on her island where she lived and did her poor penance
She told mother the day she was dyin that she always used to want to be fetched inshore when it come to the last but shed thought it over and desired to be laid on the island if twas thought right
So the funeral was out there a Saturday afternoon in September
Twas a pretty day and there want hardly a boat on the coast within twenty miles that didnt head for Shellheap cramfull o folks an all real respectful sames if shed always stayed ashore and held her friends
Some went out o mere curiosity I dont doubttheres always such to every funeral but most had real feelin and went purpose to show it
Shed got most o the wild sparrows as tame as could be livin out there so long among em and one flew right in and lit on the coffin an begun to sing while Mr Dimmick was speakin
He was put out by it an acted as if he didnt know whether to stop or go on
I may have been prejudiced but I want the only one thought the poor little bird done the best of the two
What became o the man that treated her so did you ever hear
asked Mrs Fosdick
I know he lived up to Massachusetts for a while
Somebody who came from the same place told me that he was in trade there an doin very well but that was years ago
I never heard anything more than that he went to the war in one o the early regiments
No I never heard any more of him answered Mrs Todd
Joanna was another sort of person and perhaps he showed good judgment in marryin somebody else if only hed behaved straightforward and manly
He was a shiftyeyed coaxin sort of man that got what he wanted out o folks an only gave when he wanted to buy made friends easy and lost em without knowin the difference
Shed had a piece o work tryin to make him walk accordin to her right ideas but shed have had too much variety ever to fall into a melancholy
Some is meant to be the Joannas in this world an twas her poor lot
XV On Shellheap Island SOME TIME AFTER Mrs Fosdicks visit was over and we had returned to our former quietness I was out sailing alone with Captain Bowden in his large boat
We were taking the crooked northeasterly channel seaward and were well out from shore while it was still early in the afternoon
I found myself presently among some unfamiliar islands and suddenly remembered the story of poor Joanna
There is something in the fact of a hermitage that cannot fail to touch the imagination the recluses are a sad kindred but they are never commonplace
Mrs Todd had truly said that Joanna was like one of the saints in the desert the loneliness of sorrow will forever keep alive their sad succession
Where is Shellheap Island
I asked eagerly
You see Shellheap now layin way out beyond Black Island there answered the captain pointing with outstretched arm as he stood and holding the rudder with his knee
I should like very much to go there said I and the captain without comment changed his course a little more to the eastward and let the reef out of his mainsail
I dont knows we can make an easy landin for ye he remarked doubtfully
May get your feet wet bad place to land
Trouble is I ought to have brought a tagboat but they clutch on to the water so an I do love to sail free
This gret boat gets easy bothered with anything trailin
Taint breakin much on the meetinhouse ledges guess I can fetch in to Shellheap
How long is it since Miss Joanna Todd died
I asked partly by way of explanation
Twentytwo years come September answered the captain after reflection
She died the same year as my oldest boy was born an the town house was burnt over to the Port
I didnt know but you merely wanted to hunt for some o them Indian relics
Longs you want to see where Joanna livedNo taint breakin over the ledges well manage to fetch across the shoals somehow tis such a distance to go way round and tides arisin he ended hopefully and we sailed steadily on the captain speechless with intent watching of a difficult course until the small island with its low whitish promontory lay in full view before us under the bright afternoon sun
The month was August and I had seen the color of the islands change from the fresh green of June to a sunburnt brown that made them look like stone except where the dark green of the spruces and fir balsam kept the tint that even winter storms might deepen but not fade
The few windbent trees on Shellheap Island were mostly dead and gray but there were some lowgrowing bushes and a stripe of light green ran along just above the shore which I knew to be wild morningglories
As we came close I could see the high stone walls of a small square field though there were no sheep left to assail it and below there was a little harborlike cove where Captain Bowden was boldly running the great boat in to seek a landingplace
There was a crooked channel of deep water which led close up against the shore
There you hold fast forard there an wait for her to lift on the wave
Youll make a good landin if youre smart right on the porthand side
the captain called excitedly and I standing ready with high ambition seized my chance and leaped over to the grassy bank
Im beat if I aint aground after all
mourned the captain despondently
But I could reach the bowsprit and he pushed with the boat hook while the wind veered round a little as if on purpose and helped with the sail so presently the boat was free and began to drift out from shore
Used to call this pint Joannas wharf privilege but t has worn away in the weather since her time
I thought one or two bumps wouldnt hurt us nonepaints got to be renewed anyway but I never thought shed tetch
I figured on shyin by the captain apologized
Shes too gret a boat to handle well in here but I used to sort of shy by in Joannas day an cast a little somethin ashoresome apples or a couple o pears if I had emon the grass where shed be sure to see
I stood watching while Captain Bowden cleverly found his way back to deeper water
You neednt make no haste he called to me Ill keep within call
Joanna lays right up there in the far corner o the field
There used to be a path led to the place
I always knew her well
I was out here to the funeral
I found the path it was touching to discover that this lonely spot was not without its pilgrims
Later generations will know less and less of Joanna herself but there are paths trodden to the shrines of solitude the world overthe world cannot forget them try as it may the feet of the young find them out because of curiosity and dim foreboding while the old bring hearts full of remembrance
This plain anchorite had been one of those whom sorrow made too lonely to brave the sight of men too timid to front the simple world she knew yet valiant enough to live alone with her poor insistent human nature and the calms and passions of the sea and sky
The birds were flying all about the field they fluttered up out of the grass at my feet as I walked along so tame that I liked to think they kept some happy tradition from summer to summer of the safety of nests and good fellowship of mankind
Poor Joannas house was gone except the stones of its foundations and there was little trace of her flower garden except a single faded sprig of muchenduring French pinks which a great bee and a yellow butterfly were befriending together
I drank at the spring and thought that now and then some one would follow me from the busy hardworked and simplethoughted countryside of the mainland which lay dim and dreamlike in the August haze as Joanna must have watched it many a day
There was the world and here was she with eternity well begun
In the life of each of us I said to myself there is a place remote and islanded and given to endless regret or secret happiness we are each the uncompanioned hermit and recluse of an hour or a day we understand our fellows of the cell to whatever age of history they may belong
But as I stood alone on the island in the seabreeze suddenly there came a sound of distant voices gay voices and laughter from a pleasureboat that was going seaward full of boys and girls
I knew as if she had told me that poor Joanna must have heard the like on many and many a summer afternoon and must have welcomed the good cheer in spite of hopelessness and winter weather and all the sorrow and disappointment in the world
XVI The Great Expedition MRS TODD never by any chance gave warning over night of her great projects and adventures by sea and land
She first came to an understanding with the primal forces of nature and never trusted to any preliminary promise of good weather but examined the day for herself in its infancy
Then if the stars were propitious and the wind blew from a quarter of good inheritance whence no surprises of seaturns or southwest sultriness might be feared long before I was fairly awake I used to hear a rustle and knocking like a great mouse in the walls and an impatient tread on the steep garret stairs that led to Mrs Todds chief place of storage
She went and came as if she had already started on her expedition with utmost haste and kept returning for something that was forgotten
When I appeared in quest of my breakfast she would be absentminded and sparing of speech as if I had displeased her and she was now by main force of principle holding herself back from altercation and strife of tongues
These signs of a change became familiar to me in the course of time and Mrs Todd hardly noticed some plain proofs of divination one August morning when I said without preface that I had just seen the Beggs best chaise go by and that we should have to take the grocery
Mrs Todd was alert in a moment
There
I might have known
she exclaimed
Its the 15th of August when he goes and gets his money
He heired an annuity from an uncle o his on his mothers side
I understood the uncle said none o Sam Beggs wifes folks should make free with it so after Sams gone itll all be past an spent like last summer
Thats what Sam prospers on now if you can call it prosperin
Yes I might have known
Tis the 15th o August with him an he generly stops to dinner with a cousins widow on the way home
Febuary n August is the times
Takes him bout all day to go an come
I heard this explanation with interest
The tone of Mrs Todds voice was complaining at the last
I like the grocery just as well as the chaise I hastened to say referring to a longbodied high wagon with a canopytop like an attenuated fourposted bedstead on wheels in which we sometimes journeyed
We can put things in behindroots and flowers and raspberries or anything you are going aftermuch better than if we had the chaise
Mrs Todd looked stony and unwilling
I counted upon the chaise she said turning her back to me and roughly pushing back all the quiet tumblers on the cupboard shelf as if they had been impertinent
Yes I desired the chaise for once
I aint goin berryin nor to fetch home no more wilted vegetation this year
Seasons about past except for a poor few o late things she added in a milder tone
Im goin up country
No I aint intendin to go berryin
Ive been plottin for it the past fortnight and hopin for a good day
Would you like to have me go too
I asked frankly but not without a humble fear that I might have mistaken the purpose of this latest plan
Oh certain dear
answered my friend affectionately
Oh no I never thought o any one else for compny if its convenient for you longs poor mother aint come
I aint nothin like so handy with a conveyance as I be with a good bot
Comes o my early bringingup
I expect weve got to make that great high wagon do
The tires want settin and tis all loosejointed so I can hear it shackle the other side o the ridge
Well put the basket in front
I aint goin to have it bouncin an twirlin all the way
Why Ive been makin some nice hearts and rounds to carry
These were signs of high festivity and my interest deepened moment by moment
Ill go down to the Beggs and get the horse just as soon as I finish my breakfast said I
Then we can start whenever you are ready
Mrs Todd looked cloudy again
I dont know but you look nice enough to go just as you be she suggested doubtfully
No you wouldnt want to wear that pretty blue dress o yourn way up country
Taint dusty now but it may be comin home
No I expect youd rather not wear that and the other hat
Oh yes
I shouldnt think of wearing these clothes said I with sudden illumination
Why if were going up country and are likely to see some of your friends Ill put on my blue dress and you must wear your watch I am not going at all if you mean to wear the big hat
Now youre behavin pretty responded Mrs Todd with a gay toss of her head and a cheerful smile as she came across the room bringing a saucerful of wild raspberries a pretty piece of salvage from suppertime
I was cast down when I see you come to breakfast
I didnt think twas just what youd select to wear to the reunion where youre goin to meet everybody
What reunion do you mean
I asked not without amazement
Not the Bowden Familys
I thought that was going to take place in September
Todays the day
They sent word the middle o the week
I thought you might have heard of it
Yes they changed the day
I been thinkin wed talk it over but you never can tell beforehand how its goin to be and taint worth while to wear a day all out before it comes
Mrs Todd gave no place to the pleasures of anticipation but she spoke like the oracle that she was
I wish mother was here to go she continued sadly
I did look for her last night and I couldnt keep back the tears when the dark really fell and she want here she does so enjoy a great occasion
If William had a mite o snap an ambition hed take the lead at such a time
Mother likes variety and there aint but a few nice opportunities round here an them she has to miss less she contrives to get ashore to me
I do relly hate to go to the reunion without mother an tis a beautiful day everybodyll be asking where she is
Once shed have got here anyway
Poor mothers beginnin to feel her age
Why theres your mother now
I exclaimed with joy I was so glad to see the dear old soul again
I hear her voice at the gate
But Mrs Todd was out of the door before me
There sure enough stood Mrs Blackett who must have left Green Island before daylight
She had climbed the steep road from the waterside so eagerly that she was out of breath and was standing by the garden fence to rest
She held an oldfashioned brown wicker capbasket in her hand as if visiting were a thing of every day and looked up at us as pleased and triumphant as a child
Oh what a poor plain garden
Hardly a flower in it except your bush o balm
she said
But you do keep your garden neat Almiry
Are you both well an goin up country with me
She came a step or two closer to meet us with quaint politeness and quite as delightful as if she were at home
She dropped a quick little curtsey before Mrs Todd
There mother what a girl you be
I am so pleased
I was just bewailin you said the daughter with unwonted feeling
I was just bewailin you I was so disappointed an I kep myself awake a good piece o the night scoldin poor William
I watched for the boat till I was ready to shed tears yisterday and when twas comin dark I kep making errands out to the gate an down the road to see if you want in the doldrums somewhere down the bay
There was a headwind as you know said Mrs Blackett giving me the capbasket and holding my hand affectionately as we walked up the cleanswept path to the door
I was partly ready to come but dear William said I should be all tired out and might get cold havin to beat all the way in
So we give it up and set down and spent the evenin together
It was a little rough and windy outside and I guess twas better judgment we went to bed very early and made a good start just at daylight
Its been a lovely mornin on the water
William thought hed better fetch across beyond Bird Rocks rowin the greater part o the way then we sailed from there right over to the landin makin only one tack
Williamll be in again for me tomorrow so I can come back here an rest me over night an go to meetin tomorrow and have a nice good visit
She was just havin her breakfast said Mrs Todd who had listened eagerly to the long explanation without a word of disapproval while her face shone more and more with joy
You just sit right down an have a cup of tea and rest you while we make our preparations
Oh I am so gratified to think youve come
Yes she was just havin her breakfast and we were speakin of you
Wheres William
He went right back said he expected some schooners in about noon after bait but hell come an have his dinner with us tomorrow unless it rains then next day
I laid his best things out all ready explained Mrs Blackett a little anxiously
This wind will serve him nice all the way home
Yes I will take a cup of tea deara cup of tea is always good and then Ill rest a minute and be all ready to start
I do feel condemned for havin such hard thoughts o William openly confessed Mrs Todd
She stood before us so large and serious that we both laughed and could not find it in our hearts to convict so rueful a culprit
He shall have a good dinner tomorrow if it can be got and I shall be real glad to see William the confession ended handsomely while Mrs Blackett smiled approval and made haste to praise the tea
Then I hurried away to make sure of the grocery wagon
Whatever might be the good of the reunion I was going to have the pleasure and delight of a day in Mrs Blacketts company not to speak of Mrs Todds
The early morning breeze was still blowing and the warm sunshiny air was of some ethereal northern sort with a cool freshness as it came over newfallen snow
The world was filled with a fragrance of firbalsam and the faintest flavor of seaweed from the ledges bare and brown at low tide in the little harbor
It was so still and so early that the village was but half awake
I could hear no voices but those of the birds small and great the constant song sparrows the clink of a yellowhammer over in the woods and the far conversation of some deliberate crows
I saw William Blacketts escaping sail already far from land and Captain Littlepage was sitting behind his closed window as I passed by watching for some one who never came
I tried to speak to him but he did not see me
There was a patient look on the old mans face as if the world were a great mistake and he had nobody with whom to speak his own language or find companionship
XVII A Country Road WHATEVER DOUBTS and anxieties I may have had about the inconvenience of the Beggs high wagon for a person of Mrs Blacketts age and shortness they were happily overcome by the aid of a chair and her own valiant spirit
Mrs Todd bestowed great care upon seating us as if we were taking passage by boat but she finally pronounced that we were properly trimmed
When we had gone only a little way up the hill she remembered that she had left the house door wide open though the large key was safe in her pocket
I offered to run back but my offer was met with lofty scorn and we lightly dismissed the matter from our minds until two or three miles further on we met the doctor and Mrs Todd asked him to stop and ask her nearest neighbor to step over and close the door if the dust seemed to blow in the afternoon
Shell be there in her kitchen shell hear you the minute you call twont give you no delay said Mrs Todd to the doctor
Yes Mis Dennetts right there with the windows all open
It isnt as if my fore door opened right on the road anyway
At which proof of composure Mrs Blackett smiled wisely at me
The doctor seemed delighted to see our guest they were evidently the warmest friends and I saw a look of affectionate confidence in their eyes
The good man left his carriage to speak to us but as he took Mrs Blacketts hand he held it a moment and as if merely from force of habit felt her pulse as they talked then to my delight he gave the firm old wrist a commending pat
Youre wearing well good for another ten years at this rate he assured her cheerfully and she smiled back
I like to keep a strict account of my old standbys and he turned to me
Dont you let Mrs Todd overdo todayold folks like her are apt to be thoughtless and then we all laughed and parting went our ways gayly
I suppose he puts up with your rivalry the same as ever
asked Mrs Blackett
You and he are as friendly as ever I see Almiry and Almira sagely nodded
Hes got too many long routes now to stop to tend to all his door patients she said especially them that takes pleasure in talkin themselves over
The doctor and me have got to be kind of partners hes gone a good deal far an wide
Looked tired didnt he
I shall have to advise with him an get him off for a good rest
Hell take the big boat from Rockland an go off up to Boston an mouse round among the other doctors one in two or three years and come home fresh as a boy
I guess they think considerble of him up there
Mrs Todd shook the reins and reached determinedly for the whip as if she were compelling public opinion
Whatever energy and spirit the white horse had to begin with were soon exhausted by the steep hills and his discernment of a long expedition ahead
We toiled slowly along
Mrs Blackett and I sat together and Mrs Todd sat alone in front with much majesty and the large basket of provisions
Part of the way the road was shaded by thick woods but we also passed one farmhouse after another on the high uplands which we all three regarded with deep interest the house itself and the barns and gardenspots and poultry all having to suffer an inspection of the shrewdest sort
This was a highway quite new to me in fact most of my journeys with Mrs Todd had been made afoot and between the roads in open pasturelands
My friends stopped several times for brief dooryard visits and made so many promises of stopping again on the way home that I began to wonder how long the expedition would last
I had often noticed how warmly Mrs Todd was greeted by her friends but it was hardly to be compared with the feeling now shown toward Mrs Blackett
A look of delight came to the faces of those who recognized the plain dear old figure beside me one revelation after another was made of the constant interest and intercourse that had linked the far island and these scattered farms into a golden chain of love and dependence
Now we mustnt stop again if we can help it insisted Mrs Todd at last
Youll get tired mother and youll think the less o reunions
We can visit along here any day
There if they aint frying doughnuts in this next house too
These are new folks you know from over St George way they took this old Talcot farm last year
Tis the best water on the road and the checkreins come undoneyes wed best delay a little and water the horse
We stopped and seeing a party of pleasureseekers in holiday attire the thin anxious mistress of the farmhouse came out with wistful sympathy to hear what news we might have to give
Mrs Blackett first spied her at the halfclosed door and asked with such cheerful directness if we were trespassing that after a few words she went back to her kitchen and reappeared with a plateful of doughnuts
Entertainment for man and beast announced Mrs Todd with satisfaction
Why weve perceived there was new doughnuts all along the road but youre the first that has treated us
Our new acquaintance flushed with pleasure but said nothing
Theyre very nice youve had good luck with em pronounced Mrs Todd
Yes weve observed there was doughnuts all the way along if one house is frying all the rest is tis so with a great many things
I dont suppose likely youre goin up to the Bowden reunion
asked the hostess as the white horse lifted his head and we were saying goodby
Why yes said Mrs Blackett and Mrs Todd and I all together
I am connected with the family
Yes I expect to be there this afternoon
Ive been lookin forward to it she told us eagerly
We shall see you there
Come and sit with us if its convenient said dear Mrs Blackett and we drove away
I wonder who she was before she was married
said Mrs Todd who was usually unerring in matters of genealogy
She must have been one of that remote branch that lived down beyond Thomaston
We can find out this afternoon
I expect that the familiesll march together or be sorted out some way
Im willing to own a relation that has such proper ideas of doughnuts
I seem to see the family looks said Mrs Blackett
I wish wed asked her name
Shes a stranger and I want to help make it pleasant for all such
She resembles Cousin Palina Bowden about the forehead said Mrs Todd with decision
We had just passed a piece of woodland that shaded the road and come out to some open fields beyond when Mrs Todd suddenly reined in the horse as if somebody had stood on the roadside and stopped her
She even gave that quick reassuring nod of her head which was usually made to answer for a bow but I discovered that she was looking eagerly at a tall ashtree that grew just inside the field fence
I thought twas goin to do well she said complacently as we went on again
Last time I was up this way that tree was kind of drooping and discouraged
Grown trees act that way sometimes sames folks then theyll put right to it and strike their roots off into new ground and start all over again with real good courage
Ashtrees is very likely to have poor spells they aint got the resolution of other trees
I listened hopefully for more it was this peculiar wisdom that made one value Mrs Todds pleasant company
Theres sometimes a good hearty tree growin right out of the bare rock out o some crack that just holds the roots she went on to say right on the pitch o one o them bare stony hills where you cant seem to see a wheelbarrowful o good earth in a place but that treell keep a green top in the driest summer
You lay your ear down to the ground an youll hear a little stream runnin
Every such tree has got its own livin spring theres folk made to match em
I could not help turning to look at Mrs Blackett close beside me
Her hands were clasped placidly in their thin black woolen gloves and she was looking at the flowery wayside as we went slowly along with a pleased expectant smile
I do not think she had heard a word about the trees
I just saw a nice plant o elecampane growin back there she said presently to her daughter
I havent got my mind on herbs today responded Mrs Todd in the most matteroffact way
Im bent on seeing folks and she shook the reins again
I for one had no wish to hurry it was so pleasant in the shady roads
The woods stood close to the road on the right on the left were narrow fields and pastures where there were as many acres of spruces and pines as there were acres of bay and juniper and huckleberry with a little turf between
When I thought we were in the heart of the inland country we reached the top of a hill and suddenly there lay spread out before us a wonderful great view of wellcleared fields that swept down to the wide water of a bay
Beyond this were distant shores like another country in the midday haze which half hid the hills beyond and the faraway pale blue mountains on the northern horizon
There was a schooner with all sails set coming down the bay from a white village that was sprinkled on the shore and there were many sailboats flitting about it
It was a noble landscape and my eyes which had grown used to the narrow inspection of a shaded roadside could hardly take it in
Why its the upper bay said Mrs Todd
You can see way over into the town of Fessenden
Those farms way over there are all in Fessenden
Mother used to have a sister that lived up that shore
If we started as earlys we could on a summer mornin we couldnt get to her place from Green Island till late afternoon even with a fair steady breeze and you had to strike the time just right so as to fetch up long o the tide and land near the flood
Twas ticklish business an we didnt visit back an forth as much as mother desired
You have to go way down the cost to Cold Spring Light an round that long pointup heres what they call the Back Shore
No we were most always separated my dear sister and me after the first year she was married said Mrs Blackett
We had our little families an plenty o cares
We were always lookin forward to the time we could see each other more
Now and then shed get out to the island for a few days while her husbandd go fishin and once he stopped with her an two children and made him some flakes right there and cured all his fish for winter
We did have a beautiful time together sister an me she used to look back to it longs she lived
I do love to look over there where she used to live Mrs Blackett went on as we began to go down the hill
It seems as if she must still be there though shes long been gone
She loved their farmshe didnt see how I got so used to our island but somehow I was always happy from the first
Yes its very dull to me up among those slow farms declared Mrs Todd
The snow troubles em in winter
Theyre all besieged by winter as you may say tis far better by the shore than up among such places
I never thought I should like to live up country
Why just see the carriages ahead of us on the next rise
exclaimed Mrs Blackett
Theres going to be a great gathering dont you believe there is Almiry
It hasnt seemed up to now as if anybody was going but us
An tis such a beautiful day with yesterday cool and pleasant to work an get ready I shouldnt wonder if everybody was there even the slow ones like Phebe Ann Brock
Mrs Blacketts eyes were bright with excitement and even Mrs Todd showed remarkable enthusiasm
She hurried the horse and caught up with the holidaymakers ahead
Theres all the Depfords goin six in the wagon she told us joyfully an Mis Alva Tilleys folks are now risin the hill in their new carry all
Mrs Blackett pulled at the neat bow of her black bonnet strings and tied them again with careful precision
I believe your bonnets on a little bit sideways dear she advised Mrs Todd as if she were a child but Mrs Todd was too much occupied to pay proper heed
We began to feel a new sense of gayety and of taking part in the great occasion as we joined the little train
XVIII The Bowden Reunion IT IS VERY RARE in country life where high days and holidays are few that any occasion of general interest proves to be less than great
Such is the hidden fire of enthusiasm in the New England nature that once given an outlet it shines forth with almost volcanic light and heat
In quiet neighborhoods such inward force does not waste itself upon those petty excitements of every day that belong to cities but when at long intervals the altars to patriotism to friendship to the ties of kindred are reared in our familiar fields then the fires glow the flames come up as if from the inexhaustible burning heart of the earth the primal fires break through the granite dust in which our souls are set
Each heart is warm and every face shines with the ancient light
Such a day as this has transfiguring powers and easily makes friends of those who have been coldhearted and gives to those who are dumb their chance to speak and lends some beauty to the plainest face
Oh I expect I shall meet friends today that I havent seen in a long while said Mrs Blackett with deep satisfaction
Twill bring out a good many of the old folks tis such a lovely day
Im always glad not to have them disappointed
I guess likely the best of emll be there answered Mrs Todd with gentle humor stealing a glance at me
Theres one thing certain theres nothing takes in this whole neighborhood like anything related to the Bowdens
Yes I do feel that when you call upon the Bowdens you may expect most families to rise up between the Landing and the far end of the Back Cove
Those that arent kin by blood are kin by marriage
There used to be an old story goin about when I was a girl said Mrs Blackett with much amusement
There was a great many more Bowdens then than there are now and the folks was all setting in meeting a dreadful hot Sunday afternoon and a scatterwitted little bound girl came running to the meetinhouse door all out o breath from somewheres in the neighborhood
Mis Bowden Mis Bowden
says she
Your babys in a fit
They used to tell that the whole congregation was up on its feet in a minute and right out into the aisles
All the Mis Bowdens was setting right out for home the minister stood there in the pulpit tryin to keep sober an all at once he burst right out laughin
He was a very nice man they said and he said hed better give em the benediction and they could hear the sermon next Sunday so he kept it over
My mother was there and she thought certain twas me
None of our family was ever subject to fits interrupted Mrs Todd severely
No we never had fits none of us and twas lucky we didnt way out there to Green Island
Now these folks right in front dear sakes knows the bunches o soothing catnip an yarrow Ive had to favor old Mis Evins with dryin
You can see it right in their expressions all them Evins folks
There just you look up to the crossroads mother she suddenly exclaimed
See all the teams ahead of us
And oh look down on the bay yes look down on the bay
See what a sight o boats all headin for the Bowden place cove
Oh aint it beautiful
said Mrs Blackett with all the delight of a girl
She stood up in the high wagon to see everything and when she sat down again she took fast hold of my hand
Hadnt you better urge the horse a little Almiry
she asked
Hes had it easy as we came along and he can rest when we get there
The others are some little ways ahead and I dont want to lose a minute
We watched the boats drop their sails one by one in the cove as we drove along the high land
The old Bowden house stood low storied and broadroofed in its green fields as if it were a motherly brown hen waiting for the flock that came straying toward it from every direction
The first Bowden settler had made his home there and it was still the Bowden farm five generations of sailors and farmers and soldiers had been its children
And presently Mrs Blackett showed me the stonewalled buryingground that stood like a little fort on a knoll overlooking the bay but as she said there were plenty of scattered Bowdens who were not laid theresome lost at sea and some out West and some who died in the war most of the home graves were those of women
We could see now that there were different footpaths from along shore and across country
In all these there were straggling processions walking in single file like old illustrations of the Pilgrims Progress
There was a crowd about the house as if huge bees were swarming in the lilac bushes
Beyond the fields and cove a higher point of land ran out into the bay covered with woods which must have kept away much of the northwest wind in winter
Now there was a pleasant look of shade and shelter there for the great family meeting
We hurried on our way beginning to feel as if we were very late and it was a great satisfaction at last to turn out of the stony highroad into a green lane shaded with old appletrees
Mrs Todd encouraged the horse until he fairly pranced with gayety as we drove round to the front of the house on the soft turf
There was an instant cry of rejoicing and two or three persons ran toward us from the busy group
Why dear Mis Blackettheres Mis Blackett
I heard them say as if it were pleasure enough for one day to have a sight of her
Mrs Todd turned to me with a lovely look of triumph and selfforgetfulness
An elderly man who wore the look of a prosperous seacaptain put up both arms and lifted Mrs Blackett down from the high wagon like a child and kissed her with hearty affection
I was master afraid she wouldnt be here he said looking at Mrs Todd with a face like a happy sunburnt schoolboy while everybody crowded round to give their welcome
Mothers always the queen said Mrs Todd
Yes theyll all make everything of mother shell have a lovely time today
I wouldnt have had her miss it and there wont be a thing shell ever regret except to mourn because William want here
Mrs Blackett having been properly escorted to the house Mrs Todd received her own full share of honor and some of the men with a simple kindness that was the soul of chivalry waited upon us and our baskets and led away the white horse
I already knew some of Mrs Todds friends and kindred and felt like an adopted Bowden in this happy moment
It seemed to be enough for anyone to have arrived by the same conveyance as Mrs Blackett who presently had her court inside the house while Mrs Todd large hospitable and preeminent was the centre of a rapidly increasing crowd about the lilac bushes
Small companies were continually coming up the long green slope from the water and nearly all the boats had come to shore
I counted three or four that were baffled by the light breeze but before long all the Bowdens small and great seemed to have assembled and we started to go up to the grove across the field
Out of the chattering crowd of noisy children and large waisted women whose best black dresses fell straight to the ground in generous folds and sunburnt men who looked as serious as if it were townmeeting day there suddenly came silence and order
I saw the straight soldierly little figure of a man who bore a fine resemblance to Mrs Blackett and who appeared to marshal us with perfect ease
He was imperative enough but with a grand military sort of courtesy and bore himself with solemn dignity of importance
We were sorted out according to some clear design of his own and stood as speechless as a troop to await his orders
Even the children were ready to march together a pretty flock and at the last moment Mrs Blackett and a few distinguished companions the ministers and those who were very old came out of the house together and took their places
We ranked by fours and even then we made a long procession
There was a wide path mowed for us across the field and as we moved along the birds flew up out of the thick second crop of clover and the bees hummed as if it still were June
There was a flashing of white gulls over the water where the fleet of boats rode the low waves together in the cove swaying their small masts as if they kept time to our steps
The plash of the water could be heard faintly yet still be heard we might have been a company of ancient Greeks going to celebrate a victory or to worship the god of harvests in the grove above
It was strangely moving to see this and to make part of it
The sky the sea have watched poor humanity at its rites so long we were no more a New England family celebrating its own existence and simple progress we carried the tokens and inheritance of all such households from which this had descended and were only the latest of our line
We possessed the instincts of a far forgotten childhood I found myself thinking that we ought to be carrying green branches and singing as we went
So we came to the thick shaded grove still silent and were set in our places by the straight trees that swayed together and let sunshine through here and there like a single golden leaf that flickered down vanishing in the cool shade
The grove was so large that the great family looked far smaller than it had in the open field there was a thick growth of dark pines and firs with an occasional maple or oak that gave a gleam of color like a bright window in the great roof
On three sides we could see the water shining behind the treetrunks and feel the cool salt breeze that began to come up with the tide just as the day reached its highest point of heat
We could see the green sunlit field we had just crossed as if we looked out at it from a dark room and the old house and its lilacs standing placidly in the sun and the great barn with a stockade of carriages from which two or three caretaking men who had lingered were coming across the field together
Mrs Todd had taken off her warm gloves and looked the picture of content
There
she exclaimed
Ive always meant to have you see this place but I never looked for such a beautiful opportunity weather an occasion both made to match
Yes it suits me I dont ask no more
I want to know if you saw mother walkin at the head
It choked me right up to see mother at the head walkin with the ministers and Mrs Todd turned away to hide the feelings she could not instantly control
Who was the marshal
I hastened to ask
Was he an old soldier
Dont he do well
answered Mrs Todd with satisfaction
He dont often have such a chance to show off his gifts said Mrs Caplin a friend from the Landing who had joined us
Thats Sant Bowden he always takes the lead such days
Good for nothing else most o his time trouble is he I turned with interest to hear the worst
Mrs Caplins tone was both zealous and impressive
Stimlates she explained scornfully
No Santin never was in the war said Mrs Todd with lofty indifference
It was a cause of real distress to him
He kep enlistin and traveled far an wide about here an even took the bot and went to Boston to volunteer but he aint a sound man an they wouldnt have him
They say he knows all their tactics an can tell all about the battle o Waterloo wells he can Bunker Hill
I told him once the countryd lost a great general an I meant it too
I expect youre near right said Mrs Caplin a little crestfallen and apologetic
I be right insisted Mrs Todd with much amiability
Twas most too bad to cramp him down to his peaceful trade but hes a most excellent shoemaker at his best an he always says its a trade that gives him time to think an plan his maneuvers
Over to the Port they always invite him to march Decoration Day same as the rest an he does look noble he comes of soldier stock
I had been noticing with great interest the curiously French type of face which prevailed in this rustic company
I had said to myself before that Mrs Blackett was plainly of French descent in both her appearance and her charming gifts but this is not surprising when one has learned how large a proportion of the early settlers on this northern coast of New England were of Huguenot blood and that it is the Norman Englishman not the Saxon who goes adventuring to a new world
They used to say in old times said Mrs Todd modestly that our family came of very high folks in France and one of em was a great general in some o the old wars
I sometimes think that Santins ability has come way down from then
Taint nothin hes ever acquired twas born in him
I dont knows he ever saw a fine parade or met with those that studied up such things
Hes figured it all out an got his papers so he knows how to aim a cannon right for Williams fishhouse five miles out on Green Island or up there on Burnt Island where the signal is
He had it all over to me one day an I tried hard to appear interested
His lifes all in it but he will have those poor gloomy spells come over him now an then an then he has to drink
Mrs Caplin gave a heavy sigh
Theres a great many such strayaway folks just as there is plants continued Mrs Todd who was nothing if not botanical
I know of just one sprig of laurel that grows over back here in a wild spot an I never could hear of no other on this coast
I had a large bunch brought me once from Massachusetts way so I know it
This piece grows in an open spot where youd think twould do well but its sort o poorlookin
Ive visited it time an again just to notice its poor blooms
Tis a real Sant Bowden out of its own place
Mrs Caplin looked bewildered and blank
Well all I know is last year he worked out some kind of plan sos to parade the county conference in platoons and got em all flustered up tryin to sense his ideas of a holler square she burst forth
They was holler enough anyway after ridin way down from up country into the salt air and theyd been treated to a sermon on faith an works from old Fayther Harlow that never knows when to cease
Twant no time for tactics thenthey want athinkin of the church military
Sant he couldnt do nothin with em
All he thinks of when he sees a crowd is how to march em
Tis all very well when he dont tempt too much
He never did act like other folks
Aint I just been maintainin that he aint like em
urged Mrs Todd decidedly
Strange folks has got to have strange ways for what I see
Somebody observed once that you could pick out the likeness of most every sort of a foreigner when you looked about you in our parish said Sister Caplin her face brightening with sudden illumination
I didnt see the bearin of it then quite so plain
I always did think Mari Harris resembled a Chinee
Mari Harris was pretty as a child I remember said the pleasant voice of Mrs Blackett who after receiving the affectionate greetings of nearly the whole company came to join usto see as she insisted that we were out of mischief
Yes Mari was one o them pretty little lambs that make dreadful homely old sheep replied Mrs Todd with energy
Capn Littlepage neverd look so disconsolate if she was any sort of a proper person to direct things
She might divert him yes she might divert the old gentleman an let him think he had his own way stead o arguing everything down to the bare bone
Twouldnt hurt her to sit down an hear his great stories once in a while
The stories are very interesting I ventured to say
Yes you always catch yourself athinkin what if they all was true and he had the right of it answered Mrs Todd
Hes a good sight better company though dreamy than such sordid creaturs as Mari Harris
Live and let live said dear old Mrs Blackett gently
I havent seen the captain for a good while now that I aint so constant to meetin she added wistfully
We always have known each other
Why if it is a good pleasant day tomorrow Ill get William to call an invite the captin to dinner
Williamll be in early sos to pass up the street without meetin anybody
There theyre callin out its time to set the tables said Mrs Caplin with great excitement
Heres Cousin Sarah Jane Blackett
Well I am pleased certain
exclaimed Mrs Todd with unaffected delight and these kindred spirits met and parted with the promise of a good talk later on
After this there was no more time for conversation until we were seated in order at the long tables
Im one that always dreads seeing some o the folks that I dont like at such a time as this announced Mrs Todd privately to me after a season of reflection
We were just waiting for the feast to begin
You wouldnt think such a great creatur s I be could feel all over pins an needles
I remember the day I promised to Nathan how it come over me justs I was feelin happys I could that Id got to have an own cousin o his for my near relation all the rest o my life an it seemed as if die I should
Poor Nathan saw somethin had crossed mehe had very nice feelingsand when he asked what twas I told him
I never could like her myself said he
You shant be bothered dear he says an twas one o the things that made me set a good deal by Nathan he did not make a habit of always opposin like some men
Yes says I but think o Thanksgivin times an funerals shes our relation an weve got to own her
Young folks dont think o those things
There she goes now do lets pray her by
said Mrs Todd with an alarming transition from general opinions to particular animosities
I hate her just the same as I always did but shes got on a real pretty dress
I do try to remember that shes Nathans cousin
Oh dear well shes gone by after all an aint seen me
I expected shed come pleasantin round just to show off an say afterwards she was acquainted
This was so different from Mrs Todds usual largeness of mind that I had a moments uneasiness but the cloud passed quickly over her spirit and was gone with the offender
There never was a more generous outofdoor feast along the coast then the Bowden family set forth that day
To call it a picnic would make it seem trivial
The great tables were edged with pretty oakleaf trimming which the boys and girls made
We brought flowers from the fencethickets of the great field and out of the disorder of flowers and provisions suddenly appeared as orderly a scheme for the feast as the marshal had shaped for the procession
I began to respect the Bowdens for their inheritance of good taste and skill and a certain pleasing gift of formality
Something made them do all these things in a finer way than most country people would have done them
As I looked up and down the tables there was a good cheer a grave soberness that shone with pleasure a humble dignity of bearing
There were some who should have sat below the salt for lack of this good breeding but they were not many
So I said to myself their ancestors may have sat in the great hall of some old French house in the Middle Ages when battles and sieges and processions and feasts were familiar things
The ministers and Mrs Blackett with a few of their rank and age were put in places of honor and for once that I looked any other way I looked twice at Mrs Blacketts face serene and mindful of privilege and responsibility the mistress by simple fitness of this great day
Mrs Todd looked up at the roof of green trees and then carefully surveyed the company
I see em better now theyre all settin down she said with satisfaction
Theres old Mr Gilbraith and his sister
I wish they were sittin with us theyre not among folks they can parley with an they look disappointed
As the feast went on the spirits of my companion steadily rose
The excitement of an unexpectedly great occasion was a subtle stimulant to her disposition and I could see that sometimes when Mrs Todd had seemed limited and heavily domestic she had simply grown sluggish for lack of proper surroundings
She was not so much reminiscent now as expectant and as alert and gay as a girl
We who were her neighbors were full of gayety which was but the reflected light from her beaming countenance
It was not the first time that I was full of wonder at the waste of human ability in this world as a botanist wonders at the wastefulness of nature the thousand seeds that die the unused provision of every sort
The reserve force of society grows more and more amazing to ones thought
More than one face among the Bowdens showed that only opportunity and stimulus were lackinga narrow set of circumstances had caged a fine able character and held it captive
One sees exactly the same types in a country gathering as in the most brilliant city company
You are safe to be understood if the spirit of your speech is the same for one neighbor as for the other
XIX The Feasts End THE FEAST was a noble feast as has already been said
There was an elegant ingenuity displayed in the form of pies which delighted my heart
Once acknowledge that an American pie is far to be preferred to its humble ancestor the English tart and it is joyful to be reassured at a Bowden reunion that invention has not yet failed
Beside a delightful variety of material the decorations went beyond all my former experience dates and names were wrought in lines of pastry and frosting on the tops
There was even more elaborate reading matter on an excellent early apple pie which we began to share and eat precept upon precept
Mrs Todd helped me generously to the whole word BOWDEN and consumed REUNION herself save an undecipherable fragment but the most renowned essay in cookery on the tables was a model of the old Bowden house made of durable gingerbread with all the windows and doors in the right places and sprigs of genuine lilac set at the front
It must have been baked in sections in one of the last of the great brick ovens and fastened together on the morning of the day
There was a general sigh when this fell into ruin at the feasts end and it was shared by a great part of the assembly not without seriousness and as if it were a pledge and token of loyalty
I met the maker of the gingerbread house which had called up lively remembrances of a childish story
She had the gleaming eye of an enthusiast and a look of high ideals
I could just as well have made it all of frosted cake she said but twouldnt have been the right shade the old house as you observe was never painted and I concluded that plain gingerbread would represent it best
It wasnt all I expected it would be she said sadly as many an artist had said before her of his work
There were speeches by the ministers and there proved to be a historian among the Bowdens who gave some fine anecdotes of the family history and then appeared a poetess whom Mrs Todd regarded with wistful compassion and indulgence and when the long faded garland of verses came to an appealing end she turned to me with words of praise
Sounded pretty said the generous listener
Yes I thought she did very well
We went to school together an Mary Anna had a very hard time trouble was her mother thought shed given birth to a genius an Mary Annas come to believe it herself
There I dont know what we should have done without her there aint nobody else that can write poetry between here and way up towards Rockland it adds a great deal at such a time
When she speaks o those that are gone she feels it all and so does everybody else but she harps too much
Id laid half of that away for next time if I was Mary Anna
There comes mother to speak to her an old Mr Gilbreaths sister now shell be heartened right up
Motherll say just the right thing
The leavetakings were as affecting as the meetings of these old friends had been
There were enough young persons at the reunion but it is the old who really value such opportunities as for the young it is the habit of every day to meet their comradesthe time of separation has not come
To see the joy with which these elder kinsfolk and acquaintances had looked in one anothers faces and the lingering touch of their friendly hands to see these affectionate meetings and then the reluctant partings gave one a new idea of the isolation in which it was possible to live in that after all thinly settled region
They did not expect to see one another again very soon the steady hard work on the farms the difficulty of getting from place to place especially in winter when boats were laid up gave double value to any occasion which could bring a large number of families together
Even funerals in this country of the pointed firs were not without their social advantages and satisfactions
I heard the words next summer repeated many times though summer was still ours and all the leaves were green
The boats began to put out from shore and the wagons to drive away
Mrs Blackett took me into the old house when we came back from the grove it was her fathers birthplace and early home and she had spent much of her own childhood there with her grandmother
She spoke of those days as if they had but lately passed in fact I could imagine that the house looked almost exactly the same to her
I could see the brown rafters of the unfinished roof as I looked up the steep staircase though the best room was as handsome with its good wainscoting and touch of ornament on the cornice as any old room of its day in a town
Some of the guests who came from a distance were still sitting in the best room when we went in to take leave of the master and mistress of the house
We all said eagerly what a pleasant day it had been and how swiftly the time had passed
Perhaps it is the great national anniversaries which our country has lately kept and the soldiers meetings that take place everywhere which have made reunions of every sort the fashion
This one at least had been very interesting
I fancied that old feuds had been overlooked and the old saying that blood is thicker than water had again proved itself true though from the variety of names one argued a certain adulteration of the Bowden traits and belongings
Clannishness is an instinct of the heartit is more than a birthright or a custom and lesser rights were forgotten in the claim to a common inheritance
We were among the very last to return to our proper lives and lodgings
I came near to feeling like a true Bowden and parted from certain new friends as if they were old friends we were rich with the treasure of a new remembrance
At last we were in the high wagon again the old white horse had been well fed in the Bowden barn and we drove away and soon began to climb the long hill toward the wooded ridge
The road was new to me as roads always are going back
Most of our companions had been full of anxious thoughts of homeof the cows or of young children likely to fall into disasterbut we had no reasons for haste and drove slowly along talking and resting by the way
Mrs Todd said once that she really hoped her front door had been shut on account of the dust blowing in but added that nothing made any weight on her mind except not to forget to turn a few late mullein leaves that were drying on a newspaper in the little loft
Mrs Blackett and I gave our word of honor that we would remind her of this heavy responsibility
The way seemed short we had so much to talk about
We climbed hills where we could see the great bay and the islands and then went down into shady valleys where the air began to feel like evening cool and camp with a fragrance of wet ferns
Mrs Todd alighted once or twice refusing all assistance in securing some boughs of a rare shrub which she valued for its bark though she proved incommunicative as to her reasons
We passed the house where we had been so kindly entertained with doughnuts earlier in the day and found it closed and deserted which was a disappointment
They must have stopped to tea somewheres and thought theyd finish up the day said Mrs Todd
Those that enjoyed it bestll want to get right home sos to think it over
I didnt see the woman there after all did you
asked Mrs Blackett as the horse stopped to drink at the trough
Oh yes I spoke with her answered Mrs Todd with but scant interest or approval
She aint a member o our family
I thought you said she resembled Cousin Palina Bowden about the forehead suggested Mrs Blackett
Well she dont answered Mrs Todd impatiently
I aint one thats ordnarily mistaken about family likenesses and she didnt seem to meet with friends so I went square up to her
I expect youre a Bowden by your looks says I
Yes I can take it youre one o the Bowdens
Lor no says she
Dennett was my maiden name but I married a Bowden for my first husband
I thought Id come an just see what was agoin on
Mrs Blackett laughed heartily
Im goin to remember to tell William o that she said
There Almiry the only thing thats troubled me all this day is to think how William would have enjoyed it
I do so wish William had been there
I sort of wish he had myself said Mrs Todd frankly
There want many old folks there somehow said Mrs Blackett with a touch of sadness in her voice
There aint so many to come as there used to be Im aware but I expected to see more
I thought they turned out pretty well when you come to think of it why everybody was sayin so an feelin gratified answered Mrs Todd hastily with pleasing unconsciousness then I saw the quick color flash into her cheek and presently she made some excuse to turn and steal an anxious look at her mother
Mrs Blackett was smiling and thinking about her happy day though she began to look a little tired
Neither of my companions was troubled by her burden of years
I hoped in my heart that I might be like them as I lived on into age and then smiled to think that I too was no longer very young
So we always keep the same hearts though our outer framework fails and shows the touch of time
Twas pretty when they sang the hymn wasnt it
asked Mrs Blackett at suppertime with real enthusiasm
There was such a plenty o mens voices where I sat it did sound beautiful
I had to stop and listen when they came to the last verse
I saw that Mrs Todds broad shoulders began to shake
There was good singers there yes there was excellent singers she agreed heartily putting down her teacup but I chanced to drift alongside Mis Peter Bowden o Great Bay an I couldnt help thinkin if she was as far out o town as she was out o tune she wouldnt get back in a day
XX Along Shore ONE DAY as I went along the shore beyond the old wharves and the newer highstepped fabric of the steamer landing I saw that all the boats were beached and the slack water period of the early afternoon prevailed
Nothing was going on not even the most leisurely of occupations like baiting trawls or mending nets or repairing lobster pots the very boats seemed to be taking an afternoon nap in the sun
I could hardly discover a distant sail as I looked seaward except a weatherbeaten lobster smack which seemed to have been taken for a plaything by the light airs that blew about the bay
It drifted and turned about so aimlessly in the wide reach off Burnt Island that I suspected there was nobody at the wheel or that she might have parted her rusty anchor chain while all the crew were asleep
I watched her for a minute or two she was the old Miranda owned by some of the Caplins and I knew her by an odd shaped patch of newish duck that was set into the peak of her dingy mainsail
Her vagaries offered such an exciting subject for conversation that my heart rejoiced at the sound of a hoarse voice behind me
At that moment before I had time to answer I saw something large and shapeless flung from the Mirandas deck that splashed the water high against her black side and my companion gave a satisfied chuckle
The old lobster smacks sail caught the breeze again at this moment and she moved off down the bay
Turning I found old Elijah Tilley who had come softly out of his dark fishhouse as if it were a burrow
Boy got kind o drowsy steerin of her Monroe he hove him right overboard wake now fast enough explained Mr Tilley and we laughed together
I was delighted for my part that the vicissitudes and dangers of the Miranda in a rocky channel should have given me this opportunity to make acquaintance with an old fisherman to whom I had never spoken
At first he had seemed to be one of those evasive and uncomfortable persons who are so suspicious of you that they make you almost suspicious of yourself
Mr Elijah Tilley appeared to regard a stranger with scornful indifference
You might see him standing on the pebble beach or in a fishhouse doorway but when you came nearer he was gone
He was one of the small company of elderly gauntshaped great fisherman whom I used to like to see leading up a deepladen boat by the head as if it were a horse from the waters edge to the steep slope of the pebble beach
There were four of these large old men at the Landing who were the survivors of an earlier and more vigorous generation
There was an alliance and understanding between them so close that it was apparently speechless
They gave much time to watching one anothers boats go out or come in they lent a ready hand at tending one anothers lobster traps in rough weather they helped to clean the fish or to sliver porgies for the trawls as if they were in close partnership and when a boat came in from deep sea fishing they were never too far out of the way and hastened to help carry it ashore two by two splashing alongside or holding its steady head as if it were a willful sea colt
As a matter of fact no boat could help being steady and waywise under their instant direction and companionship
Abels boat and Jonathan Bowdens boat were as distinct and experienced personalities as the men themselves and as inexpressive
Arguments and opinions were unknown to the conversation of these ancient friends you would as soon have expected to hear small talk in a company of elephants as to hear old Mr Bowden or Elijah Tilley and their two mates waste breath upon any form of trivial gossip
They made brief statements to one another from time to time
As you came to know them you wondered more and more that they should talk at all
Speech seemed to be a light and elegant accomplishment and their unexpected acquaintance with its arts made them of new value to the listener
You felt almost as if a landmark pine should suddenly address you in regard to the weather or a loftyminded old camel make a remark as you stood respectfully near him under the circus tent
I often wondered a great deal about the inner life and thought of these selfcontained old fishermen their minds seemed to be fixed upon nature and the elements rather than upon any contrivances of man like politics or theology
My friend Captain Bowden who was the nephew of the eldest of this group regarded them with deference but he did not belong to their secret companionship though he was neither young nor talkative
Theyve gone together ever since they were boys they know most everything about the sea amonst them he told me once
They was always just as you see em now since the memory of man
These ancient seafarers had houses and lands not outwardly different from other Dunnet Landing dwellings and two of them were fathers of families but their true dwelling places were the sea and the stony beach that edged its familiar shore and the fish houses where much salt brine from the mackerel kits had soaked the very timbers into a state of brown permanence and petrifaction
It had also affected the old fishermens hard complexions until one fancied that when Death claimed them it could only be with the aid not of any slender modern dart but the good serviceable harpoon of a seventeenth century woodcut
Elijah Tilley was such an evasive discouragedlooking person heavyheaded and stooping so that one could never look him in the face that even after his friendly exclamation about Monroe Pennell the lobster smacks skipper and the sleepy boy I did not venture at once to speak again
Mr Tilley was carrying a small haddock in one hand and presently shifted it to the other hand lest it might touch my skirt
I knew that my company was accepted and we walked together a little way
You mean to have a good supper I ventured to say by way of friendliness
Goin to have this ere haddock an some o my good baked potatoes must eat to live responded my companion with great pleasantness and open approval
I found that I had suddenly left the forbidding coast and come into the smooth little harbor of friendship
You aint never been up to my place said the old man
Folks dont come now as they used to no taint no use to ask folks now
My poor dear she was a great hand to draw young company
I remembered that Mrs Todd had once said that this old fisherman had been sore stricken and unconsoled at the death of his wife
I should like very much to come said I
Perhaps you are going to be at home later on
Mr Tilley agreed by a sober nod and went his way bent shouldered and with a rolling gait
There was a new patch high on the shoulder of his old waistcoat which corresponded to the renewing of the Mirandas mainsail down the bay and I wondered if his own fingers clumsy with much deepsea fishing had set it in
Was there a good catch today
I asked stopping a moment
I didnt happen to be on the shore when the boats came in
No all come in pretty light answered Mr Tilley
Addicks an Bowden they done the best Abel an me we had but a slim fare
We went out arly but not so arly as sometimes looked like a poor mornin
I got nine haddick all small and seven fish the rest on em got more fish than haddick
Well I dont expect they feel like bitin every day we larn to humor em a little an let em have their way bout it
These plaguey dogfish kind of worry em
Mr Tilley pronounced the last sentence with much sympathy as if he looked upon himself as a true friend of all the haddock and codfish that lived on the fishing grounds and so we parted
Later in the afternoon I went along the beach again until I came to the foot of Mr Tilleys land and found his rough track across the cobblestones and rocks to the field edge where there was a heavy piece of old wreck timber like a ships bone full of treenails
From this a little footpath narrow with one mans treading led up across the small green field that made Mr Tilleys whole estate except a straggling pasture that tilted on edge up the steep hillside beyond the house and road
I could hear the tinkletankle of a cowbell somewhere among the spruces by which the pasture was being walked over and forested from every side it was likely to be called the wood lot before long but the field was unmolested
I could not see a bush or a brier anywhere within its walls and hardly a stray pebble showed itself
This was most surprising in that country of firm ledges and scattered stones which all the walls that industry could devise had hardly begun to clear away off the land
In the narrow field I noticed some stout stakes apparently planted at random in the grass and among the hills of potatoes but carefully painted yellow and white to match the house a neat sharpedged little dwelling which looked strangely modern for its owner
I should have much sooner believed that the smart young wholesale egg merchant of the Landing was its occupant than Mr Tilley since a mans house is really but his larger body and expresses in a way his nature and character
I went up the field following the smooth little path to the side door
As for using the front door that was a matter of great ceremony the long grass grew close against the high stone step and a snowberry bush leaned over it topheavy with the weight of a morningglory vine that had managed to take what the fishermen might call a half hitch about the doorknob
Elijah Tilley came to the side door to receive me he was knitting a blue yarn stocking without looking on and was warmly dressed for the season in a thick blue flannel shirt with white crockery buttons a faded waistcoat and trousers heavily patched at the knees
These were not his fishing clothes
There was something delightful in the grasp of his hand warm and clean as if it never touched anything but the comfortable woolen yarn instead of cold sea water and slippery fish
What are the painted stakes for down in the field
I hastened to ask and he came out a step or two along the path to see and looked at the stakes as if his attention were called to them for the first time
Folks laughed at me when I first bought this place an come here to live he explained
They said twant no kind of a field privilege at all no place to raise anything all full o stones
I was aware twas good land an I worked some on itodd times when I didnt have nothin else on handtill I cleared them loose stones all out
You never see a prettier piece than tis now now did ye
Well as for them painted marks thems my buoys
I struck on to some heavy rocks that didnt show none but a plowd be liable to ground on em an so I ketched holt an buoyed em sames you see
They dont trouble me no moren if they want there
You havent been to sea for nothing I said laughing
One trade helps another said Elijah with an amiable smile
Come right in an set down
Come in an rest ye he exclaimed and led the way into his comfortable kitchen
The sunshine poured in at the two further windows and a cat was curled up sound asleep on the table that stood between them
There was a newlooking light oilcloth of a tiled pattern on the floor and a crockery teapot large for a household of only one person stood on the bright stove
I ventured to say that somebody must be a very good housekeeper
Thats me acknowledged the old fisherman with frankness
There aint nobody here but me
I try to keep things looking right sames poor dear left em
You set down here in this chair then you can look off an see the water
None on em thought I was goin to get along alone no way but I want goin to have my house turned upsi down an all changed about no not to please nobody
I was the only one knew just how she liked to have things set poor dear an I said I was goin to make shift and I have made shift
Id rather tough it out alone
And he sighed heavily as if to sigh were his familiar consolation
We were both silent for a minute the old man looked out the window as if he had forgotten I was there
You must miss her very much
I said at last
I do miss her he answered and sighed again
Folks all kep repeatin that time would ease me but I cant find it does
No I miss her just the same every day
How long is it since she died
I asked
Eight year now come the first of October
It dont seem near so long
Ive got a sister that comes and stops long o me a little spell spring an fall an odd times if I send after her
I aint near so good a hand to sew as I be to knit and shes very quick to set everything to rights
Shes a married woman with a family her sons folks lives at home an I cant make no great claim on her time
But it makes me a kind o good excuse when I do send to help her a little she aint none too well off
Poor dear always liked her and we used to contrive our ways together
Tis full as easy to be alone
I set here an think it all over an think considerable when the weathers bad to go outside
I get so some days it feels as if poor dear might step right back into this kitchen
I keep awatchin them doors as if she might step in to ary one
Yes maam I keep alookin off an droppin o my stitches thats just how it seems
I cant git over losin of her no way nor no how
Yes maam thats just how it seems to me
I did not say anything and he did not look up
I git feelin so sometimes I have to lay everything by an go out door
She was a sweet pretty creatur longs she lived the old man added mournfully
Theres that little rockin chair o hern I set an notice it an think how strange tis a creatur like her should be gone an that chair be here right in its old place
I wish I had known her Mrs Todd told me about your wife one day I said
Youd have liked to come and see her all the folks did said poor Elijah
Shed been so pleased to hear everything and see somebody new that took such an intrest
She had a kind o gift to make it pleasant for folks
I guess likely Almiry Todd told you she was a pretty woman especially in her young days late years too she kep her looks and come to be so pleasant lookin
There taint so much matter I shall be done afore a great while
No I shant trouble the fish a great sight more
The old widower sat with his head bowed over his knitting as if he were hastily shortening the very thread of time
The minutes went slowly by
He stopped his work and clasped his hands firmly together
I saw he had forgotten his guest and I kept the afternoon watch with him
At last he looked up as if but a moment had passed of his continual loneliness
Yes maam Im one that has seen trouble he said and began to knit again
The visible tribute of his careful housekeeping and the clean bright room which had once enshrined his wife and now enshrined her memory was very moving to me he had no thought for any one else or for any other place
I began to see her myself in her homea delicatelooking faded little woman who leaned upon his rough strength and affectionate heart who was always watching for his boat out of this very window and who always opened the door and welcomed him when he came home
I used to laugh at her poor dear said Elijah as if he read my thought
I used to make light of her timid notions
She used to be fearful when I was out in bad weather or baffled about gittin ashore
She used to say the time seemed long to her but Ive found out all about it now
I used to be dreadful thoughtless when I was a young man and the fish was bitin well
Id stay out late some o them days an I expect shed watch an watch an lose heart awaitin
My heart alive
what a supper shed git an be right there watchin from the door with somethin over her head if twas cold waitin to hear all about it as I come up the field
Lord how I think o all them little things
This was what she called the best room in this way he said presently laying his knitting on the table and leading the way across the front entry and unlocking a door which he threw open with an air of pride
The best room seemed to me a much sadder and more empty place than the kitchen its conventionalities lacked the simple perfection of the humbler room and failed on the side of poor ambition it was only when one remembered what patient saving and what high respect for society in the abstract go to such furnishing that the little parlor was interesting at all
I could imagine the great day of certain purchases the bewildering shops of the next large town the aspiring anxious woman the clumsy sea tanned man in his best clothes so eager to be pleased but at ease only when they were safe back in the sailboat again going down the bay with their precious freight the hoarded money all spent and nothing to think of but tiller and sail
I looked at the unworn carpet the glass vases on the mantelpiece with their prim bunches of bleached swamp grass and dusty marsh rosemary and I could read the history of Mrs Tilleys best room from its very beginning
You see for yourself what beautiful rugs she could make now Im going to show you her best tea things she thought so much of said the master of the house opening the door of a shallow cupboard
Thats real chiny all of it on those two shelves he told me proudly
I bought it all myself when we was first married in the port of Bordeaux
There never was one single piece of it broke until Well I used to say long as she lived there never was a piece broke but long at the last I noticed shed look kind o distressed an I thought twas count o me boastin
When they asked if they should use it when the folks was here to supper time o her funeral I knew shed want to have everything nice and I said certain
Some o the women they come runnin to me an called me while they was takin of the chiny down an showed me there was one o the cups broke an the pieces wropped in paper and pushed way back here corner o the shelf
They didnt want me to go an think they done it
Poor dear
I had to put right out o the house when I see that
I knowed in one minute how twas
Wed got so used to sayin twas all there justs I fetched it home an so when she broke that cup somehow or nother she couldnt frame no words to come an tell me
She couldnt think twould vex me twas her own hurt pride
I guess there want no other secret ever lay between us
The French cups with their gay sprigs of pink and blue the best tumblers an old flowered bowl and tea caddy and a japanned waiter or two adorned the shelves
These with a few daguerreotypes in a little square pile had the closet to themselves and I was conscious of much pleasure in seeing them
One is shown over many a house in these days where the interest may be more complex but not more definite
Those were her best things poor dear said Elijah as he locked the door again
She told me that last summer before she was taken away that she couldnt think o anything more she wanted there was everything in the house an all her rooms was furnished pretty
I was goin over to the Port an inquired for errands
I used to ask her to say what she wanted cost or no costshe was a very reasonable woman an twas the place where she done all but her extra shopping
It kind o chilled me up when she spoke so satisfied
You dont go out fishing after Christmas
I asked as we came back to the bright kitchen
No I take stiddy to my knitting after January sets in said the old seafarer
Taint worth while fish make off into deeper water an you cant stand no such perishin for the sake o what you get
I leave out a few traps in sheltered coves an do a little lobsterin on fair days
The young fellows braves it out some on em but for me I lay in my winters yarn an set here where tis warm an knit an take my comfort
Mother learnt me once when I was a lad she was a beautiful knitter herself
I was laid up with a bad knee an she said twould take up my time an help her we was a large family
Theyll buy all the folks can do down here to Addicks store
They say our Dunnet stockins is gettin to be celebrated up to Bostongood quality o wool an even knittin or somethin
Ive always been called a pretty hand to do nettin but seines is master cheap to what they used to be when they was all hand worked
I change off to nettin long towards spring and I piece up my trawls and lines and get my fishin stuff to rights
Lobster pots they require attention but I make em up in spring weather when its warm there in the barn
No I aint one o them that likes to set an do nothin
You see the rugs poor dear did them she want very partial to knittin old Elijah went on after he had counted his stitches
Our rugs is beginnin to show wear but I cant master none o them womanish tricks
My sister she tinkers em up
She said last time she was here that she guessed theyd last my time
The old ones are always the prettiest I said
You aint referrin to the braided ones now
answered Mr Tilley
You see ours is braided for the most part an their good looks is all in the beginnin
Poor dear used to say they made an easier floor
I go shufflin round the house sames if twas a bot and I always used to be stubbin up the corners o the hooked kind
Her an me was always havin our jokes together sames a boy an girl
Outsiders neverd know nothin about it to see us
She had nice manners with all but to me there was nobody so entertainin
Shed take off anybodys natural talk winter evenins when we set here alone so youd think twas them a speakin
There there
I saw that he had dropped a stitch again and was snarling the blue yarn round his clumsy fingers
He handled it and threw it off at arms length as if it were a cod line and frowned impatiently but I saw a tear shining on his cheek
I said that I must be going it was growing late and asked if I might come again and if he would take me out to the fishing grounds someday
Yes come any time you want to said my host taint so pleasant as when poor dear was here
Oh I didnt want to lose her an she didnt want to go but it had to be
Such things aint for us to say theres no yes an no to it
You find Almiry Todd one o the best o women
said Mr Tilley as we parted
He was standing in the doorway and I had started off down the narrow green field
No there aint a better hearted woman in the State o Maine
Ive known her from a girl
Shes had the best o mothers
You tell her Im liable to fetch her up a couple or three nice good mackerel early tomorrow he said
Now dont let it slip your mind
Poor dear she always thought a sight o Almiry and she used to remind me there was nobody to fish for her but I dont reclect it as I ought to
I see you drop a line yourself very handy now an then
We laughed together like the best of friends and I spoke again about the fishing grounds and confessed that I had no fancy for a southerly breeze and a ground swell
Nor me neither said the old fisherman
Nobody likes em say what they may
Poor dear was disobliged by the mere sight of a bot
Almirys got the best o mothers I expect you know Mis Blackett out to Green Island and we was always plannin to go out when summer come but there I couldnt pick no days weather that seemed to suit her just right
I never set out to worry her neither twant no kind o use she was so pleasant we couldnt have no fret nor trouble
Twas never you dear an you darlin afore folks an you divil behind the door
As I looked back from the lower end of the field I saw him still standing a lonely figure in the doorway
Poor dear I repeated to myself half aloud I wonder where she is and what she knows of the little world she left
I wonder what she has been doing these eight years
I gave the message about the mackerel to Mrs Todd
Been visitin with Lijah
she asked with interest
I expect you had kind of a dull session he aint the talkin kind dwellin so much long o fish seems to make em lose the gift o speech
But when I told her that Mr Tilley had been talking to me that day she interrupted me quickly
Then twas all about his wife an he cant say nothin too pleasant neither
She was modest with strangers but there aint one o her old friends can ever make up her loss
For me I dont want to go there no more
Theres some folks you miss and some folks you dont when theyre gone but there aint hardly a day I dont think o dear Sarah Tilley
She was always right there yes you knew just where to find her like a plain flower
Lijahs worthy enough I do esteem Lijah but hes a ploddin man
XXI The Backward View AT LAST IT WAS the time of late summer when the house was cool and damp in the morning and all the light seemed to come through green leaves but at the first step out of doors the sunshine always laid a warm hand on my shoulder and the clear high sky seemed to lift quickly as I looked at it
There was no autumnal mist on the coast nor any August fog instead of these the sea the sky all the long shore line and the inland hills with every bush of bay and every firtop gained a deeper color and a sharper clearness
There was something shining in the air and a kind of lustre on the water and the pasture grassa northern look that except at this moment of the year one must go far to seek
The sunshine of a northern summer was coming to its lovely end
The days were few then at Dunnet Landing and I let each of them slip away unwillingly as a miser spends his coins
I wished to have one of my first weeks back again with those long hours when nothing happened except the growth of herbs and the course of the sun
Once I had not even known where to go for a walk now there were many delightful things to be done and done again as if I were in London
I felt hurried and full of pleasant engagements and the days flew by like a handful of flowers flung to the sea wind
At last I had to say goodby to all my Dunnet Landing friends and my homelike place in the little house and return to the world in which I feared to find myself a foreigner
There may be restrictions to such a summers happiness but the ease that belongs to simplicity is charming enough to make up for whatever a simple life may lack and the gifts of peace are not for those who live in the thick of battle
I was to take the small unpunctual steamer that went down the bay in the afternoon and I sat for a while by my window looking out on the green herb garden with regret for company
Mrs Todd had hardly spoken all day except in the briefest and most disapproving way it was as if we were on the edge of a quarrel
It seemed impossible to take my departure with anything like composure
At last I heard a footstep and looked up to find that Mrs Todd was standing at the door
Ive seen to everything now she told me in an unusually loud and businesslike voice
Your trunks are on the warf by this time
Capn Bowden he come and took em down himself an is going to see that theyre safe aboard
Yes Ive seen to all your rangements she repeated in a gentler tone
These things Ive left on the kitchen table youll want to carry by hand the basket neednt be returned
I guess I shall walk over towards the Port now an inquire how old Mis Edward Caplin is
I glanced at my friends face and saw a look that touched me to the heart
I had been sorry enough before to go away
I guess youll excuse me if I aint down there to stand around on the warf and see you go she said still trying to be gruff
Yes I ought to go over and inquire for Mis Edward Caplin its her third shock and if mother gets in on Sunday shell want to know just how the old lady is
With this last word Mrs Todd turned and left me as if with sudden thought of something she had forgotten so that I felt sure she was coming back but presently I heard her go out of the kitchen door and walk down the path toward the gate
I could not part so I ran after her to say goodby but she shook her head and waved her hand without looking back when she heard my hurrying steps and so went away down the street
When I went in again the little house had suddenly grown lonely and my room looked empty as it had the day I came
I and all my belongings had died out of it and I knew how it would seem when Mrs Todd came back and found her lodger gone
So we die before our own eyes so we see some chapters of our lives come to their natural end
I found the little packages on the kitchen table
There was a quaint West Indian basket which I knew its owner had valued and which I had once admired there was an affecting provision laid beside it for my seafaring supper with a neatly tied bunch of southernwood and a twig of bay and a little old leather box which held the coral pin that Nathan Todd brought home to give to poor Joanna
There was still an hour to wait and I went up the hill just above the schoolhouse and sat there thinking of things and looking off to sea and watching for the boat to come in sight
I could see Green Island small and darkly wooded at that distance below me were the houses of the village with their appletrees and bits of garden ground
Presently as I looked at the pastures beyond I caught a last glimpse of Mrs Todd herself walking slowly in the footpath that led along following the shore toward the Port
At such a distance one can feel the large positive qualities that control a character
Close at hand Mrs Todd seemed able and warmhearted and quite absorbed in her bustling industries but her distant figure looked mateless and appealing with something about it that was strangely selfpossessed and mysterious
Now and then she stooped to pick somethingit might have been her favorite pennyroyaland at last I lost sight of her as she slowly crossed an open space on one of the higher points of land and disappeared again behind a dark clump of juniper and the pointed firs
As I came away on the little coastwise steamer there was an old sea running which made the surf leap high on all the rocky shores
I stood on deck looking back and watched the busy gulls agree and turn and sway together down the long slopes of air then separate hastily and plunge into the waves
The tide was setting in and plenty of small fish were coming with it unconscious of the silver flashing of the great birds overhead and the quickness of their fierce beaks
The sea was full of life and spirit the tops of the waves flew back as if they were winged like the gulls themselves and like them had the freedom of the wind
Out in the main channel we passed a bentshouldered old fisherman bound for the evening round among his lobster traps
He was toiling along with short oars and the dory tossed and sank and tossed again with the steamers waves
I saw that it was old Elijah Tilley and though we had so long been strangers we had come to be warm friends and I wished that he had waited for one of his mates it was such hard work to row along shore through rough seas and tend the traps alone
As we passed I waved my hand and tried to call to him and he looked up and answered my farewells by a solemn nod
The little town with the tall masts of its disabled schooners in the inner bay stood high above the flat sea for a few minutes then it sank back into the uniformity of the coast and became indistinguishable from the other towns that looked as if they were crumbled on the furzygreen stoniness of the shore
The small outer islands of the bay were covered among the ledges with turf that looked as fresh as the early grass there had been some days of rain the week before and the darker green of the sweetfern was scattered on all the pasture heights
It looked like the beginning of summer ashore though the sheep round and warm in their winter wool betrayed the season of the year as they went feeding along the slopes in the low afternoon sunshine
Presently the wind began to blow and we struck out seaward to double the long sheltering headland of the cape and when I looked back again the islands and the headland had run together and Dunnet Landing and all its coasts were lost to sight
