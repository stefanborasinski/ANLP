When the thing was at its hottest I bolted
Tom like the darling he isYes you are old fellow youre as precious to me asas you are to the policeif they could only get their hands on youwell Tom drew off the crowd having passed the old gentlemans watch to me and I made for the womens rooms
The station was crowded as it always is in the afternoon and in a minute I was strolling into the big square room saying slowly to myself to keep me steady Nancy youre a college girljust in from Bryn Mawr to meet your papa
Just see if your hats on straight
I did going up to the big glass and looking beyond my excited face to the room behind me
There sat the woman who can never nurse her baby except where everybody can see her in a railroad station
There was the woman whos always hungry nibbling chocolates out of a box and the woman fallen asleep with her hat on the side and hairpins dropping out of her hair and the woman whos beside herself with fear that shell miss her train and the woman who is taking notes about the other womens rigs
And And I didnt like the look of that man with the cap who opened the swinging door a bit and peeped in
The womens waitingroom is no place for a mannor for a girl whos got somebody elses watch inside her waist
Luckily my back was toward him but just as the door swung back he might have caught the reflection of my face in a mirror hanging opposite to the big one
I retreated going to an inner room where the ladies were having the maid brush their gowns soiled from suburban travel and the dirty station
The deuce is in it the way women stare
I took off my hat and jacket for a reason to stay there and hung them up as leisurely as I could
Nance I said under my breath to the alerteyed pugnosed girl in the mirror who gave a quick glance about the room as I bent to wash my hands women stare cause theyre women
Theres no meaning in their look
If they were men now you might twitter
I smoothed my hair and reached out my hand to get my hat and jacket whenwhen Oh it was long long enough to cover you from your chin to your heels
It was a dark warm red and it had a high collar of chinchilla that was fairly scrumptious
And just above it the hat hung a redcloth toque caught up on the side with some of the same fur
The black maid misunderstood my involuntary gesture
I had all my best duds on and when a lot of women stare it makes the woman they stare at peacock naturally andandwell ask Tom what he thinks of my style when Im on parade
At any rate it was the maids fault
She took down the coat and hat and held them for me as though they were mine
What could I do cept just slip into the silklined beauty and set the toque on my head
The fool girl that owned them was having another maid mend a tear in her skirt over in the corner the little place was crowded
Anyway I had both the coat and hat on and was out into the big anteroom in a jiffy
What nearly wrecked me was the cut of that coat
It positively made me shiver with pleasure when I passed and saw myself in that long mirror
My but I was great
The hang of that coat the long incurving sweep in the back and the high fur collar up to ones noseeven if it is a turnedup noseoh
I stayed and looked a second too long for just as I was pulling the flaring hat a bit over my face the doors swung as an old lady came in and there behind her was that same curious mans face with the cap above it
Trapped
Me
Not much
I didnt wait a minute but threw the doors open with a gesture that might have belonged to the Queen of Spain
I almost ran into his arms
He gave an exclamation
I looked him straight in the eyes as I hooked the collar close to my throat and swept past him
He weakened
That coat was too jolly much for him
It was for me too
As I ran down the stairs its influence so worked on me that I didnt know just which Vanderbilt I was
I got out on the sidewalk all right and was just about to take a car when the turnstile swung round and there was that same man with the cap
His face was a funny mixture of doubt and determination
But it meant the Correction for me
Nance Olden its over I said to myself
But it wasnt
For it was then that I caught sight of the carriage
It was a fat low comfortable elegant sober carriage wide and wellkept with rubbertired wheels
And the two heavy horses were fat and elegant and sober too and wide and wellkept
I didnt know it was the Bishops thenI didnt care whose it was
It was empty and it was mine
Id rather go to the Correctionbeing too young to get to the place youre bound for Tom Dorganin it than in the patrol wagon
At any rate it was all the chance I had
I slipped in closing the door sharply behind me
The man on the boxhe was wide and wellkept toowas tired waiting I suppose for he continued to doze gently his high coachmans collar up over his ears
I cursed that collar which had prevented his hearing the door close for then he might have driven off
But it was great inside soft and warm the cushions of dark plum the seat wide and roomy a church paper some notes for the Bishops next sermon and a copy of Quo Vadis
I just snuggled down trust me
I leaned far back and lay low
When I did peek out the window I saw the man with the brass buttons and the cap turning to go inside again
Victory
He had lost the scent
Who would look for Nancy Olden in the Bishops carriage
Now you know how early I got up yesterday to catch the train sos Tom and I could come in with the people and be naturally mingling with them
And you remember the dance the night before
I hadnt had more than three hours sleep and the snug warmth of that coach was just nuts to me after the freezing ride into town
I didnt dare get out for fear of some other man in a cap and buttons somewhere on the lookout
I knew they couldnt be on to my hidingplace or theyd have nabbed me before this
After a bit I didnt want to get out I was so warm and comfortableand elegant
O Tom you should have seen your Nance in that coat and in the Bishops carriage
First thing I knew I was dreaming you and I were being married and you had brass buttons all over you and I had the cloak all right but it was a weddingdress and the chinchilla was a wormy sort of orange blossoms andand I waked when the handle of the door turned and the Bishop got in
Asleep
Thats what
Id actually been asleep
And what did I do now
Thats easyfell asleep again
There wasnt anything else to do
Not really asleep this time you know just just asleep enough to be wide awake to any chance there was in it
The horses had started and the carriage was halfway across the street before the Bishop noticed me
He was a little Bishop not big and fat and wellkept like the rig but short and lean with a little white beard and the softest eyeand the softest heartand the softest head
Just listen
Lord bless me
he exclaimed hurriedly putting on his spectacles and looking about bewildered
I was slumbering sweetly in the corner but I could see between my lashes that he thought hed jumped into somebody elses carriage
The sight of his book and his papers comforted him though and before he could make a resolution I let the jolting of the carriage as it crossed the cartrack throw me gently against him
Daddy I murmured sleepily letting my head rest on his little prim shoulder
That comforted him too
Hush your laughing Tom Dorgan I mean calling him daddy seemed to kind of take the cuss off the situation
My child he began very gently
Oh daddy I exclaimed snuggling down close to him you kept me waiting so long I went to sleep
I thought youd never come
He put his arm about my shoulders in a fatherly way
You know I found out later the Bishop never had had a daughter
I guess he thought he had one now
Such a simple dear old soul
Just the same Tom Dorgan if he had been my father Id never be doing stunts with tipsy mens watches for you nor if Id had any father
Now dont get mad
Think of the Bishop with his gentle thin old arm about my shoulders holding me for just a second as though I was his daughter
My think of it
And me Nance Olden with that fat mans watch in my waist and some girls beautiful long coat and hat on all covered with chinchilla
Theres some mistake my little girl he said shaking me gently to wake me up for I was going to sleep again he feared
Oh I knew you were kept at the office I interrupted quickly
I preferred to be farther from the station with that girls red coat before I got out
Weve missed our train anyway havent we
After this daddy dear lets not take this route
If wed go straight through on the one road we wouldnt have this drive across town every time
I was wondering before I fell asleep what in the world Id do in this big city if you didnt come
He forgot to withdraw his arm so occupied was he by my predicament
What would you do my child if you hadhad missed youryour father
Wasnt it clumsy of him
He wanted to break it to me gently and this was the best he could do
What would I do
I gasped indignantly
Why daddy imagine me alone andand without money
Whywhy how can you There
there
he said patting me soothingly on the shoulder
That baby of a Bishop
The very thought of Nancy Olden out alone in the streets was too much for him
He had put his free hand into his pocket and had just taken out a bill and was trying to plan a way to offer it to me and reveal the fact to poor modest little Nance Olden that he was not her own daddy when an awful thing happened
We had got up street as far as the operahouse when we were caught in the jam of carriages in front the last afternoon opera of the season was just over
I was so busy thinking what would be my next move that I didnt notice much outsideand I didnt want to move Tom not a bit
Playing the Bishops daughter in a trailing coat of red trimmed with chinchilla is just your Nancys graft
But the dear little Bishop gave a jump that almost knocked the roof off the carriage pulled his arm from behind me and dropped the tendollar bill he held as though it burned him
It fell in my lap
I jammed it into my coat pocket
Where is it now
Just you wait Tom Dorgan and youll find out
I followed the Bishops eyes
His face was scarlet now
Right next to our carriagemine and the Bishopsthere was another not quite so fat and heavy and big but smart I tell you with the silver harness jangling and the horses arching their backs under their bluecloth jackets monogrammed in leather
All the same I couldnt see anything to cause a loving father to let go his onliest daughter in such a hurry till the old lady inside bent forward again and gave us another look
Her face told it then
It was a big smooth face with accordionplaited chins
Her hair was white and her nose was curved and the pearls in her big ears brought out every ugly spot on her face
Her lips were thin and her neck hung with diamonds looked like a bed with bolsters and pillows piled high and her eyesoh Tom her eyes
They were little and very gray and they bored their way straight through the windowshers and oursand hit the Bishop plumb in the face
My if I could only have laughed
The Bishop the dear prim little Bishop in his own carriage with his arm about a young woman in red and chinchilla offering her a banknote and Mrs Dowager Diamonds her eyes popping out of her head at the sight and she one of the lady pillars of his churchoh Tom
it took all of this to make that poor innocent next to me realize how he looked in her eyes
But you see it was over in a minute
The carriage wheels were unlocked and the blue coupe went whirling away and we in the plumcushioned carriage followed slowly
I decided that Id had enough
Now and here in the middle of all these carriages was a bully good time and place for me to get away
I turned to the Bishop
He was blushing like a boy
I blushed too
Yes I did Tom Dorgan but it was because I was bursting with laughter
Oh dear
I exclaimed in sudden dismay
Youre not my father
Nono my dear IIm not he stammered his face purple now with embarrassment
I was just trying to tell you you poor little girl of your mistake and planning a way to help you when He made a gesture of despair toward the side where the coupe had been
I covered my face with my hands and shrinking over into the corner I cried Let me out
let me out
Youre not my father
Oh let me out
Why certainly child
But Im old enough surely to be and I wishI wish I were
You do
The dignity and tenderness and courtesy in his voice sort of sobered me
But all at once I remembered the face of Mrs Dowager Diamonds and I understood
Oh because of her I said smiling and pointing to the side where the coupe had been
My but it was a rotten bad move
I ought to have been strapped for it
Oh Tom Tom it takes moren a red coat with chinchilla to make a blackhearted thing like me into the girl he thought I was
He stiffened and sat up like a prim little schoolboy his soft eyes hurt like a dogs thats been wounded
I wont tell you what I did then
No I wont
And you wont understand but just that minute I cared more for what he thought of me than whether I got to the Correction or anywhere else
It made us friends in a minute and when he stopped the carriage to let me out my hand was still in his
But I wouldnt go
Id made up my mind to see him out of his part of the scrape and first thing you know we were driving up toward the Square if you please to Mrs Dowager Diamonds house
He thought it was his scheme the poor lamb to put me in her charge till my lost daddy could send for me
Hed no more idea that I was steering him toward her that he was doing the only thing possible the only square thing by his reputation than he had that Nance Olden had been raised by the Cruelty and then flung herself away on the first handsome Irish boy she met
Thatll do Tom
Girls if you could have seen Mrs Dowager Diamonds face when she came down the stairs the Bishops card in her hand and into the gorgeous parlor itd have been as good as a front seat at the show
She was mad and she was curious and she was amazed and she was disarmed for the very nerve of his bringing me to her staggered her so that she could hardly believe shed seen what she had
My dear Mrs Ramsay he began confused a bit by his remembrance of how her face had looked fifteen minutes before I bring to you an unfortunate child who mistook my carriage for her fathers this afternoon at the station
She is a college girl a stranger in town and till her father claims her Oh the baby
the baby
She was stiffening like a rod before his very eyes
How did his words explain his having his arm round the unfortunate child
His conscience was so clean that the dear little man actually overlooked the fact that it wasnt my presence in the carriage but his conduct there that had excited Mrs Dowager Diamonds
And didnt the story sound thin
I tell you Tom when it comes to lying to a woman youve got to think up something stronger than it takes to make a man believe in youif you happen to be female yourself
I didnt wait for him to finish but waltzed right in
I danced straight up to that side of beef with the diamonds still on it and flinging my arms about her turned a coy eye on the Bishop
You said your wife was out of town daddy I cried gaily
Have you got another wife besides mummy
The poor Bishop
Do you think he tumbled
Not a bitnot a bit
He sat there gasping like a fish and Mrs Dowager Diamonds surprised by my sudden attack stood bolt upright about as pleasant to hug asas you are Tom when youre jealous
The trouble with the Bishops set is that its deadly slow
Now if I had really been the Bishops daughterall right Ill go on
Oh mummy I went on quickly
You know how I said it Tomthe way I told you after that last row that Dan Christensen wasnt near so goodlooking as youremember
Oh mummy you dont know how good it feels to get home
Out there at that awful college studying and studying and studying sometimes I thought Id lose my senses
Theres a girl out there now suffering from nervous prostration
She worked so hard preparing for the midyears
Whats her name
I cant thinkI cant think my heads so tired
But it sounds like mine a lot like mine
OnceI think it was yesterdayI thought it was mine and I made up my mind suddenly to come right home and bring it with me
But it cant be mine can it
It cant be my name shes got
It cant be mummy say it cant say it cant
Tom I ought to have gone on the stage
Ill go yet when youre sent up some day
Yes I will
Youll be where you cant stop me
I couldnt see the Bishop but the Dowageroh Id got her
Not so bad an old body either if you only take her the right way
First she was suspicious and then she was scared
And then bit by bit the stiffness melted out of her her arms came up about me and there I was lying all comfy with the diamonds on her neck boring rosettes in my cheeks and she asniffling over me and patting me and telling me not to get excited that it was all right and now I was home mummy would take care of me she would that she would
She did
She got me on to a lounge soft asas marshmallows and she piled one silk pillow after another behind my back
Come dear let me help you off with your coat she cooed bending over me
Oh mummy its so cold
Cant I please keep it on
To let that coat off me was to give the whole thing away
My rig underneath though good enough for your girl Tom on a holiday wasnt just what they wear in the Square
And dye know youll say its silly but I had a conviction that with that coat I should say goodby to the nerve Id had since I got into the Bishops carriageand from there into society
I let her take the hat though and I could see by the way she handled it that it was all rightthe thing her kind you know
Oh the girl I got it from had good taste all right
I closed my eyes for a moment as I lay there and she stood stroking my hair
She must have thought Id fallen asleep for she turned to the Bishop and holding out her hand she said softly My dear dear Bishop you are the besthearted the saintliest man on earth
Because you are so beautifully cleansouled yourself you must pardon me
I am ashamed to say it but I shall have no rest till I do
When I saw you in the carriage downtown with that poor demented child I thought for just a momentoh can you forgive me
It shows what an evil mind I have
But you who know so well what Edward is what my life has been with him will see how much reason I have to be suspicious of all men
I shook I laughed so hard
What a corker her Edward must be
See Tom poor old Mrs Dowager up in the Square having the same devils luck with her man as Molly Elliott down in the Alley has with hers
I wonder if youre all alike
No for theres the Bishop
He had taken her hand sympathizingly forgivingly but his silence made me curious
I knew he wouldnt let the old lady believe for a moment I was luny if once he could be sure himself that I wasnt
You lie Tom Dorgan he wouldnt
WellBut the poor baby how could he expect to see through a game that had caught the Dowager herself
Still I could hear him walking softly toward me and I felt him looking keenly down at me long before I opened my eyes
When I did you should have seen him jump
Guilty he felt
I could see the blood rush up under his clear thin old skin soft as a babys to find himself caught trying to spy out my secret
I just looked bigeyed up at him
You know the way Mollys kid does when he wakes
I looked a long long time as though I was puzzled
Daddy I said slowly sitting up
Youyou are my daddy aint you
Yesyes of course
It was the Dowager who got between him and me hinting heavily at him with nods and frowns
But the dear old fellow only got pinker in the effort to look a lie and not say it
Still he looked relieved
Evidently he thought I was luny all right but that I had lucid intervals
I heard him whisper something like this to the Dowager just before the maid came in with tea for me
Yes Tom Dorgan tea for Nancy Olden off a silver salver out of a cup like a painted eggshell
My but that almost floored me
I was afraid Id give myself dead away with all those little jars and jugs
So I said I wasnt hungry though Lord knows I hadnt had anything to eat since early morning
But the Dowager sent the maid away and took the tray herself operating all the jugs and pots for me and then tried to feed me the tea
She was about as handy as Mollys little sister is with the babybut I allowed myself to be coaxed and drank it down
Tea Tom Dorgan
Ever taste tea
If you knew how to behave yourself in polite society Id give you a card to my friend the Dowager up in the Square
How to get away
That was the thing that worried me
Id just made up my mind to have a lucid interval when crcreak the front door opened and in walked Tom youre mighty cuteso cute youll land us both behind bars some daybut you cant guess who came in on our little family party
Yesoh yes youve met him
Well the old duffer whose watch was ticking inside my waist that very minute
Yes sir the same redfaced bignecked fellow wed spied getting full at the little station in the country
Only he was a bit mellower than when you grabbed his chain
Well he was Edward
I almost dropped the cup when I saw him
The Dowager took it from me saying There dear dont be nervous
Its onlyonly She got lost
It couldnt be my daddythe Bishop was that
But it was her husband so who could it be
Evening Bishop
Hello Henrietta back so soon from the opera
roared Edward in a big husky voice
Hed had more since we saw him but he walked straight as the Bishop himself and hes a dear little ramrod
Ah
his eyes lit up at sight of meah MissMissof course Ive met the young lady Henrietta but hang me if I havent forgotten her name
MissMiss Murieson lied the old lady glibly
Aa relative
Why mummy
I said reproachfully
Therethere
Its only a joke
Isnt it a joke Edward
she demanded laughing uneasily
Joke
he repeated with a hearty bellow of laughter
Best kind of a joke I call it to find so pretty a girl right in your own house eh Bishop
Why does he call my father Bishop mummy
I couldnt help it
The fun of hearing the Dowager lie and knowing the Bishop beside himself with the pain of deception was too much for me
I could see she didnt dare trust her Edward with my sad story
Ho
ho
The Bishopthats good
No my dear Miss Murieson if this ladys your mother why I must beat least I ought to be your father
As such Im going to have all the privileges of a parentbless me if Im not
I dont suppose hed have done it if hed been sober but theres no telling when you remember the reputation the Dowager had given him
But hed got no further than to put his arm around me when both the Bishop and the Dowager flew to the rescue
My but they were shocked
I couldnt help wondering what theyd have done if Edward had happened to see the Bishop in the same sort of tableau earlier in the afternoon
But I got a lucid interval just then and distracted their attention
I stood for a moment my head bent as though I was thinking deeply
I think Ill go now I said at length
II dont understand exactly how I got here I went on looking from the Bishop to the Dowager and back again or how I happened to miss my father
Im everso much obliged to you and if you will give me my hat Ill take the next train back to college
Youll do nothing of the sort said the Dowager promptly
My dear youre a sweet girl thats been studying too hard
You must go to my room and rest And stay for dinner
Dont you care
Sometimes I dont know how I get here myself
Edward winked jovially
Well I did
While the Dowagers back was turned I gave him the littlest one in return for his
It made him drunker than ever
I think said the Bishop grimly with a significant glance at the Dowager as he turned just then and saw the old cock ogling me the young lady is wiser than we
Ill take her to the station The station
Ugh
Not Nance Olden with the red coat still on
Impossible my dear Bishop interrupted the Dowager
She cant be permitted to go back on the train alone
Why MissMiss Murieson Ill see you back all the way to the college door
Not at all not at all
Charmed
First well have dinneror first Ill telephone out there and tell em youre with us so that if theres any rule or anything of that sort The telephone
This wretched Edward with half his wits gave me more trouble than the Bishop and the Dowager put together
She jumped at the idea and left the room only to come back again to whisper to me What name my dear
What name
what name
I repeated blankly
What name indeed
I wonder how Nance Olden would have done
Dont hurry dear dont perplex yourself she whispered anxiously noting my bewilderment
Theres plenty of time and it makes no differencenot a particle really
I put my hand to my head
I cant thinkI cant think
Theres one girl has nervous prostration and her names got mixed with mine and I cant Hush hush
Never mind
You shall come and lie down in my room
Youll stay with us tonight anyway and well have a doctor in Bishop
Thats right assented the Bishop
Ill go get him myself
Youyoure not going
I cried in dismay
It was real
I hated to see him go
Nonsensephone
It was Edward who went himself to telephone for the doctor and I saw my time getting short
But the Bishop had to go anyway
He looked out at his horses shivering in front of the house and the sight hurried him
My child he said taking my hand just let Mrs Ramsay take care of you tonight
Dont bother about anything but just rest
Ill see you in the morning he went on noticing that I kind of clung to him
Well I did
Cant you remember what I said to you in the carriagethat I wished you were my daughter
I wish you were indeed I do and that I could take you home with me and keep you child
Thentonightifwhen you praywill you pray for me as if I wasyour own daughter
Tom Dorgan you think no prayers but a priests are any good you bigoted snickering Catholic
I tell you if some day I cut loose from you and start in over again itll be the Bishops prayers thatll do it
The Dowager and I passed Edward in the ball
He gave me a look behind her back and I gave him one to match it
Just practice you know Tom
A girl can never know when shell want to be expert in these things
She made me lie down on a couch while she turned the lamp low and then left me alone in a big palace of a bedroom filled with things
And I wanted everything I saw
If I could Id have lifted everything in sight
But every minute brought that doctor nearer
Soon as I could be really sure she was gone I got up and hurrying to the long French windows that opened on the great stone piazza I unfastened them quietly and inch by inch I pushed them open
There within ten feet of me stood Edward
No escape that way
He saw me and was tiptoeing heavily toward me when I heard the door click behind me and in walked the Dowager back again
I flew to her
I thought I heard some one out there I said
It frightened me so that I got up to look
Nobody could be out there could they
She walked to the window and put her head out
Her lips tightened grimly
No nobody could be out there she said breathing hard but you might get nervous just thinking there might be
Well go to a room upstairs
And go we did in spite of all I could plead about feeling well enough now to go alone and all the rest of it
How was I to get out of a second or thirdstory window
I began to think about the Correction again as I followed her upstairs and after shed left me I just sat waiting for the doctor to come and send me there
I didnt much care till I remembered the Bishop
I could almost see his face as it would look when hed be called to testify against me and Id be standing in that railedin prisoners pen in the middle of the courtroom where Dan Christensen stood when they tried him
No I couldnt bear that not without a fight anyway
It was for the Bishop Id got into this part of the scrape
Id get out of it sos he shouldnt know how bad a thing a girl can be
While I lay thinking it over the same maid that had brought me the tea came in
She was an ugly thin little thing
If shes a sample of the maids in that house the lot of them would take the kink out of your pretty hair Thomas J Dorgan Esquire late of the House of Refuge and soon of Moyamensing
Dont throw things
People in my set mine and the Dowagers dont
She had been sent to help me undress she said and make me comfortable
The doctor lived just around the corner and would be in in a minute
Phew
She wasnt very promising but she was my only chance
I took her
I really dont need any help thank you Nora I said chipper as a sparrow and remembering the name the Dowager had called her by
Aunt Henrietta is too fussy dont you think
Oh of course you wont say a word against her
She told me the other day that shed never had a maid so sensible and quickwitted too as her Nora
Do you know Ive a mind to play a joke on the doctor when he comes
Youll help me wont you
Oh I know you will
Suddenly I remembered the Bishops bill
I took it out of my pocket
Yep Tom thats where it went
I had to choose between giving that skinny maid the biggest tip she ever got in her lifeor Nance Olden to the Correction
You neednt swear Tom Dorgan
I fancy if Id got there youd got worse
No you bully you know I wouldnt tell but the police sort of know how to pair our kind
In her cap and apron I let the doctor in and myself out
And I dont regret a thing up there in the Square except that lovely red coat with the high collar and the hat with the fur on it
Id giveTom get me a coat like that and Ill marry you for life
No theres one thing I could do better if it was to be done over again
I could make that dear little old Bishop wish harder Id been his daughter
What am I mooning about
Ohnothing
Theres the watchEdwards watch
Take it
II
Yes emptyhanded Tom Dorgan
And I cant honestly say I didnt have the chance butif my hands are empty my head is full
Listen
Theres a girl I know with short brown hair a turnedup nose and gray eyes rather far apart
You know her too
Well she cant help that
But this girloh she makes such a pretty boy
And the ladies at the hotel over in Brooklyn they just dote on her when shes not only a boy but a bellboy
Her name may be Nancy when shes in petticoats but in trousers shes Nathanielin short Nat
Now Nat in blue and buttons with his nails kept better than most boys with his curly hair parted in the middle and with a gentle tang to his voice that makes him almost girlishwho would suspect Nat of having a stolen passkey in his pocket and a pretty fair knowledge of the contents of almost every top bureaudrawer in the hotel
Not Mrs Sarah Kingdon a widow just arrived from Philadelphia and desperately gone on young Mr George Moriway also fresh from Philadelphia and desperately gone on Mrs Kingdons money
The tips that lady gave the bad boy Nat
I knew I couldnt make you believe it any other way thats why I passed em on to you Tommyboy
The hotel woman you know girls is a hotel woman because she isnt fit to be anything else
Shes lazy and selfish and little and shes shifted all her legitimate cares on to the proprietors shoulders
She actuallyyou can understand and share my indignation cant you Tom as youve shared other thingsshe even gives over her black tin box full of valuables to the hotel clerk to put in the safe the coward
But her vanityah theres where we get her such speculators as you and myself
Shes got to outshine the woman who sits at the next table and so she borrows her diamonds from the clerk wears em like the peacock she is and trembles till theyre back in the safe again
In the meantime she locks them up in the tin box which she puts in her top bureaudrawer hides the key forgets where she hid it andO Tom
after searching for it for hours and making herself sick with anxiety she ties up her head in a wet handkerchief with vinegar on it andrings the bell for the bellboy
He comes
As I said hes a prompt gentle little bellboy slight looks rather young for his job but that very youth and innocence of his make him such a fellow to trust
Nat says Mrs Kingdon tearfully pressing half a dollar into the nice lads hand IIve lost something and I want you toto help me find it
Yesm says Nat
Hes the soul of politeness
It must be hereit must be in this room says the lady getting wild with the terror of losing
Im surepositivethat I went straight to the shoebag and slipped it in there
And now I cant find it and I must have it before I go out this afternoon forfor a very special reason
My daughter Evelyn will be home tomorrow andwhy dont you look for it
What is it maam
I told you once
My keya little flat key that locksa box Ive got she finishes distrustfully
Have you looked in the shoebag maam
Why of course I have you little stupid
I want you to hunt other places where I cant easily get
There are other places I might have put it but Im positive it was in the shoebag
Well I looked for that key
Where
Where not
I looked under the rubbish in the wastepaper basket Mrs Kingdon often fooled thieves by dropping it there
I pulled up the corner of the carpet and looked thereit was loose it had often been used for a hidingplace
I looked in Miss Evelyns boot and in her ribbon box
I emptied Mrs Kingdons full powder box
I climbed ladders and felt along cornices
I looked through the pockets of Mrs Kingdons gownsa clever bellboy it takes to find a womans pocket but even the real masculine ones among em are half feminine theyve had so much to do with women
I rummaged through her writingdesk and in searching a goldcornered pad found a note from Moriway hidden under the corner
I hid it again carefullyin my coat pocket
A loveletter from Moriway to a woman twenty years older than himselftaint a bad lay Tom Dorgan but you neednt try it
At first she watched every move I made but later as her headache grew worse she got desperate
So then I put my hand down into the shoebag and found the key where it had slipped under a fold of cloth
Do you suppose that woman was grateful
She snatched it from me
I knew it was there
I told you it was there
If youd had any sense youd have looked there first
The boys in this hotel are so stupid
Thats all maam
She nodded
She was fitting the key into the black box shed taken from the top drawer
Nat had got to the outside door when he heard her come shrieking after him
NatNatcome back
My diamondstheyre not here
I know I put them back last nightIm positive
I could swear to it
I can see myself putting them in the chamois bag andO my God where can they be
This time theyre gone
Nat could have told herbut whats the use
He felt shed only lose em again if she had em
So he let them lie snug in his trousers pocketwhere he had put the chamois bag when his eyes lit on it under the corner of the carpet
He might have passed it over to her then but you see Tom she hadnt told him to look for a bag it was a key she wanted
Bellboys are so stupid
This time she followed his every step
He could not put his hand on the smallest thing without rousing her suspicion
If he hesitated she scolded
If he hurried she fumed
Most unjust I call it because he had no thought of stealingjust then
Come she said at last well go down and report it at the desk
Hadnt I better wait here maam and look again
She looked sharply at him
No youd better do just as I tell you
So down we went
And we met Mr Moriway there
Shed telephoned him
The chambermaid was called the housekeeper the electrical engineer whod been fixing bells that morning and as I said a bellboy named Nat who told how hed just come on duty when Mrs Kingdons bell rang found her key and returned it to her and was out of the room when she unlocked the box
That was all he knew
Is he telling the truth
Moriway asked Mrs Kingdon
Yees I guess he is but where are the diamonds
We must have themyou knowtoday George she whispered
And then she turned and went upstairs leaving Moriway to do the rest
Theres only one thing to do Major he said to the proprietor
Search em all and then Search me
Its an outrage
cried the housekeeper
Search me if ye loike growled McCarthy resentfully
Oi wasnt there but a minute the lady herself can tell ye that
Katie the chambermaid flushed painfully and there were indignant tears in her eyes which Ill tell you in confidence made a girl named Nancy uncomfortable
But the boy Nat knowing that bellboys have no rights said nothing
But he thought
He thought Tom Dorgan a lot of things and a long way ahead
The peppery old Major marched us all off to his private office
Not much girls it hadnt come
For suddenly the annunciator rang out
Out of the corner of his eye Nat looked at the bellboys bench
It was empty
There was to be a ball that night and the bells were going it over all the place
Number Twentyone
shouted the clerk at the desk
But Number Twentyone didnt budge
His heart was beating like a hammer and the tingngng of that bell calling him rang in his head like a song
Number Twentyone
yelled the clerk
Oh hes got a devil of a temper has that clerk
Some day Tom when you love me very much go up to the hotel and break his face for me
Youboyconfound you cant you hear
he shouted
That time he caught the Majors earthe one that wasnt deaf
He looked from Powers black face to the bench and then to me
And all the time the bell kept ringing like mad
Git
he said to the boy
And come back in a hurry
Number Twentyone gotbut leisurely
It wouldnt do for a bellboy to hurry particularly when he had such good cause
Oh girls those stone stairs the servants stairs at the St James
Theyre fierce
I tell you Mag scrubbing the floors at the Cruelty aint so bad
But this time I was jolly glad bellboys werent allowed in the elevator
For there were those diamonds in my pants pocket and I must get rid of em before I got down to the office again
So I climbed those stairs and every step I took my eye was searching for a hidingplace
I could have pitched the little bag out of a window but Nancy Olden wasnt throwing diamonds to the birds any more than Mag here is likely to cut off the braids of red hair we used to play horse with when we drove her about the Cruelty yard
One flight
No chance
Another
Everything bare as stone and soap could keep it
The third flightmy knees began to tremble and not with climbing
The call came from this floor
But I ran up a fourth just on the chance and there in a corner was a fire hatchet strapped to the wall
Behind that hatchet Mrs Kingdons diamonds might lie snug till evening
I put the ends of my fingers first in the little crack to make sure the little bag wouldnt drop to the floor and then dived into my pocket and And there behind me stealthily coming up the last turn of the stairs was Mr George Moriway
Dont you hate a softwalking man Mag
That cute fellow was cuter than the old Major himself and had followed me every inch of the way
Theres something loose with this hatchet sir I said innocently looking down at him
Oh there is
What an observing little fellow you are
Never mind the hatchet just tell me what number you were sent to answer
Number
I repeated as though I couldnt see why he wanted to know
Why431
Not much my boy331
Scuse me sir aint you mistaken
He looked at me for full a minute
I stared him straight in the eye
A nasty eye hes gotblack and bloodshot and cold and full of suspicion
But it wavered a bit at the end
I may be he said slowly but not about the number
Just you turn around and get down to 331
All right sir
Thank you very much
It might have got me in trouble
The ladies are so particular about having the bells answered quick I guess youll get in trouble all right he said and stood watchingfrom where he stood he could watch me every inch of the waytill I got to 331 at the end of the hall Mrs Kingdons door
And the goods still on me Tom mind that
My but Mrs Kingdon was wrathy when she saw me
Why did they send you
she cried
Why did you keep me waiting so long
I want a chambermaid
Ive rung a dozen times
The whole place is crazy about that old ball tonight and no one can get decent attention
Cant I do what you want maam
I just yearned to get inside that door
No she snapped
I dont want a boy to fasten my dress in the back We often do maam I said softly
You do
Well Yesm
I breathed again
Wellits indecent
Go down and send me a maid
She was just closing the door in my faceand Moriway waiting for me to watch me down again
Mrs Kingdon Well what do you want
I want to tell you that when I get down to the office theyll search me
She looked at me amazed
Andand theres something in my pocket Iyou wouldnt like them to find
What in the worldmy diamonds
You did take them you little wretch
She caught hold of my coat
But Lordy
I didnt want to get away a little bit
I let her pull me in and then I backed up against the door and shut it
Diamonds
Oh no maam
I hope Im not a thief
Butbut it was something you droppedthis
I fished Moriways letter out of my pocket and handed it to her
The poor old lady
Being a bellboy you know just how old ladies really are
This one at evening after her face had been massaged for an hour and the manicure girl and the hairdresser had gone wasnt so bad
But today with the marks of the mornings tears on her agitated face with the blood pounding up to her temples where the hair was thin and grayTom Dorgan if Im a vain old fool like that when Im three times as old as I am just tie a stone around my neck and take me down and drop me into the nearest water wont you
You abominable little wretch
she sobbed
I suppose youve told everybody in the office
How could I maam
How could you
She looked up the tears on her flabby flushed cheek
I didnt know myself
I cant read writing It was thin but she wanted to believe it
She could have taken me in her arms she was so happy
There
there
she patted my shoulder and gave me a dollar bill
I was a bit hasty Nat
Its only aa little business matter that Mr Moriways attending to for me
Wewell finish it up this afternoon
I shouldnt like Miss Kingdon to know of it becausebecause Inever like to worry her about business you know
So dont mention it when she comes tomorrow
Nom
Shall I fasten your dress
I simply had to stay in that room till I could get rid of those diamonds
With a faded old blushthe nicest thing about her Id ever seenshe turned her back
Its dark today maam I coaxed
Would you mind coming nearer the window
No she wouldnt mind
She backed up to the corner like a gentle little lamb
While I hooked with one hand I dropped the little bag where the carpet was still turned up and with the toe of my shoe spread it flat again
Youre real handy for a boy she said pleased
Thank you maam I answered pleased myself
Moriway was still watching me of course when I came out but I ran downstairs he following close and when the Major got hold of me I pulled my pockets inside out like a little man
Moriway was there at the time
I knew he wasnt convinced
But he couldnt watch a bellboy all day long and the moment I was sure his eyes were off me I was ready to get those diamonds back again
But not a call came all that afternoon from the west side of the house except the call of those pretty precious things snug under the carpet calling calling to me to come and get them and drop bellboying for good
At last I couldnt stand it any longer
Theres only one thing to do when your chance wont come to you that is to go to it
At about four oclock I lit out climbed to the second story and thereMag I always was the luckiest girl at the Cruelty wasnt I
Well there was suite 231 all torn up plumbers and painters in there and nothing in the world to prevent a boys skinning through when no one was watching out of the window and up the fireescape
Just outside of Mrs Kingdons window I lay still a minute
I had seen her and Moriway go out togethershe all gay with finery he carrying her bag
The lace curtains in 331 were blowing in the breeze
Cautiously I parted them and looked in
Everything was lovely
From where I lay I reached down and turned back the flap of the carpet
It was too easy
Those darling diamonds seemed just to leap up into my hand
In a moment I had them tucked away in my pants pocket
Then down the fireescape and out through 231 where I told the painter Id been to get a toy the boy in 441 had dropped out of the window
But he paid no attention to me
No one did though I felt those diamonds shining like an Xray through my very body
I got downstairs and was actually outside the door almost in the street and off to you when a girl called me
Here boy carry this case she said
Do you know who it was
Oh yes you do a dear old friend of mine from Philadelphia a young lady whose tastewell all right Ill tell you it was the girl with the red coat and the hat with the chinchilla fur
How did they look
Oh fairly well on a blonde
But to my taste the last girl Id seen in the coat and hat was handsomer
Well I carried her suitcase and followed her back into the hotel
I didnt want to a bit though that coat stillwonder how she got it back
She sailed up the hall and into the elevator and I had to follow
We got of at the third story and she brought me right to the door of 331
And then I knew this must be Evelyn
Mrs Kingdons out Miss
She didnt expect you till tomorrow
Did she tell you that
Too bad she isnt at home
She said shed be kept busy all day today with a business matter and that Id better not get here till tomorrow
But I Wanted to get here in time for the wedding
I suggested softly
You should have seen her jump
Wedding
Not Mrs Kingdon and Mr
Moriway
She turned white
Has that man followed her here
Quick tell me
Has she actually married him
Nonot yet
Its for five oclock at the church on the corner
How do you know
She turned on me suddenly suspicious
WellI do know
And Im the only person in the house that does
I dont believe you
She took out her key and opened the door and I followed her in with the suitcase
But before I could get it set down on the floor she had swooped on a letter that was lying in the middle of the table had torn it open and then with a cry had come whirling toward me
Where is this church
Come help me to get to it before five and Illoh you shall have anything in the world you want
She flew out into the hall I after her
And first thing you know we were down in the street around the corner and there in front of the church was a carriage with Moriway just helping Mrs Kingdon out
Mother
At that cry the old ladys knees seemed to crumble under her
Her poor old painted face looked out ghastly and ashamed from her wedding finery
But Evelyn in her red coat flew to her and took her in her arms as though she was a child
And like a child Mrs Kingdon sobbed and made excuses and begged to be forgiven
I looked at Moriway
It was all the pay I wantedparticularly as I had those little diamonds
Youre just in time Miss Kingdon he said uneasily to make your mother happy by your presence at her wedding
Im just in time Mr Moriway to see that my mothers not made unhappy by your presence
Evelyn
Mrs Kingdon remonstrated
Come Sarah
Moriway offered his arm
The bride shook her head
Tomorrow she said feebly
Moriway breathed a swear
Miss Kingdon laughed
Ive come to take care of you you silly little mother dear 



It wont be tomorrow Mr
Moriway
Nonot tomorrownext week sighed Mrs Kingdon
In fact mothers changed her mind Mr Moriway
She thinks it ungenerous to accept such a sacrifice from a man who might be her sondont you mother
Well perhaps George She looked up from her daughters shouldershe was crying all over that precious red coat of mineand her eyes lit on me
Ohyou wicked boy you told a lie
she gasped
You did read my letter
I laughed laughed out loud it was such a bully thing to watch Moriways face
But that was an unlucky laugh of mine it turned his wrath on me
He made a dive toward me
I ducked and ran
Oh how I ran
But if he hadnt slipped on the curb hed have had me
As he fell though he let out a yell
Stop thief
stop thief
Thief
Thief
Thief
May you never hear it Mag behind you when youve somebody elses diamonds in your pocket
It soundsit sounds the way the bay of the hounds must sound to the hare
It seems to fly along with the air at the same time to be behind you at your side even in front of you
I heard it bellowed in a dozen different voices and every now and then I could hear Moriway as I pelted onthat brassy cruel bellow of his that made my heart sick
And then all at once I heard a policemans whistle
That whistle was like a signalI saw the gates of the Correction open before me
I saw your Nance Tom in a neat striped dress and she was behind barsbarsbars
There were bars everywhere before me
In fact I felt them against my very hands for in my mad race I had shot up a blind alleya street that ended in a garden behind an iron fence
I grabbed the diamonds to throw them from me but I couldntI just couldnt
I jumped the fence where the gate was low and with that whistle flying shrill and shriller after me I ran to the house
I might have jumped from the fryingpan
Of course I might
But it was all fire to me
To be caught at the end is at least no worse than to be caught at the beginning
Anyhow it was my one chance and I took it as unhesitatingly as a rat takes a leap into a trap to escape a terrier
Onlyonly it was my luck that the trap wasnt set
The room was empty
I pushed open a glass door and fell over an open trunk that stood beside it
It bruised my knee and tore my hand but ohit was nuts to me
For it was a womans trunk filled with womens things
A skirt
A blessed skirt
And not a striped one
I threw off the bellboys jacket and I got into that dear dress so quick it made my head swim
The jacket was a bit tight but I didnt button it and Id just got a stiff little hat perched on my head when I heard the tramp of men on the sidewalk and in the dusk saw the cops buttons at the gate
Caught
Not much
Not yet
I threw open the glass doors and walked out into the garden
MissOmarI wonder if it would be Miss Omar
You bet I didnt take time to see who it was talking before I answered
Of course I was Miss Omar
I was Miss Anybody that had a right to wear skirts and be inside those blessed gates
Ahh
I fancied you might be
Ive been expecting you
It was a lazy low voice with a laugh in it and it came from a wheeled chair where a young man lay
Sallow he was and slim and long and helplessyou could see that by his white hanging hands
But his voiceit was what a womans voice would be if she were a man
It made you perk up and pretend to be somewhere near its level
It fitted his soft black clothes and his fine clean face
It meant silks and velvets and Oh all right Tommy Dorgan if youre going to get jealous of a voice
Excuse me Mr
Latimer
The cop came in as he spoke Moriway following the rest of the hounds hung about
Theres a thieving bellboy from the hotel thats somewhere in your grounds
Can I come in and get him
In here Sergeant
Arent you mistaken
No Mr Moriway here saw him jump the gate not five minutes since
Strange and I here all the time
I may have dozed of though
Certainlycertainly
Look for the little rascal
Whats he stolen
Diamonds
Tut
tut
Enterprising isnt he



Miss Omar wont you kindly reach the bell yonderno on the table thats itand ring for some one to take the officer about
I rang
Do you know what happened
An electric light strung on the tree above the table shone out and there I stood under it with Moriways eyes full upon me
Great
he began
Just ring again Mr Latimers voice came soft as silk
My fingers trembled so the bell clattered out of them and fell jangling to the ground
But it rang
And the light above me went out like magic
I fell back into a garden chair
I beg your pardon Mrwas Moriway the nameI must have interrupted you but my eyes are troubling me this evening and I cant bear the light
Miss Omar I thought the housekeeper had instructed you one ring means lights two mean I want Burnett
Here he comes


Burnett take Sergeant Mulhill through the place
Hes looking for a thief
You will accompany the Sergeant MrMoriway
Thank youno
If you dont mind Ill wait out here
That meant me
I moved toward the gate
Not at all
Have a seat
Miss Omar sit down wont you
I sat down
Miss Omar reads to me Mr Moriway
Im an invalid as you see dependent on the good offices of my man
I find a womans voice a soothing change
It must be
Particularly if the voice is pleasing
Miss OmarI didnt quite catch the name He waited
But Miss Omar had nothing to say that minute
Yes thats the name
Youve got it all right said Latimer
An uncommon name isnt it
I dont think I ever heard it before
Do you know Miss Omar as I heard your voice just before we got to the gate it sounded singularly boyish to me
Mr Latimer does not find it sodo you
I said as sweetas sweet as I could coax
How sweets that Tom Dorgan
Not at all
A little laugh came from Latimer as though he was enjoying a joke all by himself
But Moriway jumped with satisfaction
He knew the voice all right
Have you a brother may I ask
He leaned over and looked keenly at me
I am an orphan I said sadly with no relatives
A pitiful position sneered Moriway
You look so much like a boy I know that Do you really think so
So awfully polite was Latimer to such a rat as Moriway
Why
Well wait
I cant agree with you
Do you know I find Miss Omar very feminine
Of course short hair Her hair is short then
Typhoid I murmured
Too bad
Moriway sneered
Yes I snapped
I thought it was at the time
My hair was very heavy and long and I had a chance to sit in a window at Troyons where they were advertising a hair tonic and Rotten
Of course it was
Id no business to gabble and just because you and your new job Mag came to my mind at that minute there I went putting my foot in it
Moriway laughed
I didnt like the sound of his laugh
Your reader is versatile Mr Latimer he said
Yes
Latimer smoothed the soft silk rug that lay over him
Poverty and that sort of versatility are often bedfellows eh



Tell me Mr Moriway these lost diamonds are yours
No
They belong to aa friend of mine Mrs
Kingdon
Oh
the old lady who was married this afternoon to a young fortunehunter
I couldnt resist it
Moriway jumped out of his seat
She was not married he stuttered
She Changed her mind
How sensible of her
Did she find out what a crook the fellow was
What was his nameMorrison
NoMiddlewayI have heard it
May I ask Miss OmarI didnt have to see his face his voice told how mad with rage he washow you come to be acquainted with a matter that only the contracting parties could possibly know of
Why they cant have kept it very secret the old lady and the young rascal who was after her money for you see we both knew of it and I wasnt the bride and you certainly werent the groom were you
An exclamation burst from him
Mr Latimer he stormed may I see you a moment alone
Phew
That meant me
But I got up just the same
Just keep your seat Miss Omar
Oh that silken voice of Latimers
Mr Moriway I have absolutely no acquaintance with you
I never saw you till tonight
I cant imagine what you may have to say to me that my secretaryMiss Omar acts in that capacitymay not hear
I want to say burst from Moriway that she looks the image of the boy Nat who stole Mrs Kingdons diamonds that the voice is exactly the same that But you have said it Mr Moriwayquite successfully intimated it I assure you
She knows of myof Mrs Kingdons marriage that that boy Nat found out about
And you yourself also as Miss Omar mentioned
Myself
Damn it Im Moriway the man she was going to marry
Why shouldnt I Ahh
Latimers shoulders shook with a gentle laugh
Well Mr Moriway gentlemen dont swear in my garden
Particularly when ladies are present
Shall we say good evening
Here comes Mulhill now



Nothing Sergeant
Too bad the rogue escaped but youll catch him
They may get away from you but they never stay long do they
Good eveninggood evening Mr
Moriway
They tramped on and out Moriways very back showing his rage
He whispered something to the Sergeant who turned to look at me but shook his head and the gate clanged after them
A long sigh escaped me
Warm isnt it
Latimer leaned forward
Now would you mind ringing again Miss Omar
I bent and groped for the bell and rang it twice
How quick you are to learn
he said
But I really wanted the light this time



Just light up Burnett he called to the man who had come out on the porch
The electric bulb flashed out again just over my head
Latimer turned and looked at me
When I couldnt bear it any longer I looked defiantly up at him
Pardon he said smiling nice teeth he has and clear eyes
I was just looking for that boyish resemblance Mr Moriway spoke of
I hold to my first opinionyoure very feminine Miss Omar
Will you read to me now if you please
He pointed to a big open book on the table beside his couch
I thinkif you dont mind Mr Latimer Ill begin the reading tomorrow
I got up to go
I was through with that garden now
But I do mind
Silken voice
Not a bit of it
I turned on him so furious I thought I didnt care what came of itwhen over by the great gatepost I saw a man crouchingMoriway
I sat down again and pulled the book farther toward the light
We didnt learn much poetry at the Cruelty did we Mag
But I know some now just the same
When I began to read I heard only one wordMoriwayMoriwayMoriway
But I must haveforgotten him after a time and the dark garden with the light on only one spot and the roses smelling and Latimer lying perfectly still his face turned toward me for I was readinglisten I bet I can remember that part of it if I say it slow Oh Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make And evn with Paradise devise the Snake For all the sin wherewith the Face of Man Is blackendMans forgiveness giveand take
when all at once Mr Latimer put his hand on the book
I looked up with a start
The shadow by the gate was gone
Yon rising Moon that looks for us again How oft hereafter will she wax and wane How oft hereafter rising look for us Through this same Gardenand for ONE in vain
Latimer was saying it without the book and with a queer smile that made me feel I hadnt quite caught on
Thank you that will do he went on
That is enough Miss He stopped
I waited
He did not say Omar
I looked him square in the eyeand then I had enough
But what in the devil did you make believe for
I asked
He smiled
If ever you come to lie on your back day and night year in and year out and know that never in your life will it be any different you may take pleasure in a bit of excitement andand learn to pity the under dog who in this case happened to be a boy that leaped over the gate as though his heart was in his mouth
Just as you would admire the nerve of the young lady that came out of the house a few minutes after in your housekeepers Sunday gown
Yes grin Torn Dorgan
You wont grin long
I put down the book and got up to go
Good night then and thank you Mr
Latimer
Good night



Oh Miss He didnt say Omarthere is a favor you might do me
Sure
I wondered what it could be
Those diamonds
Ive got to have them you know to send them back to their owner
I dont mind helping aa person who helps himself to other peoples things but I cant let him get away with his plunder without being that kind of person myself
So Why didnt I lie
Because there are some people you dont lie to Tom Dorgan
Dont talk to me you bully Im savage enough
To have rings and pins and earrings a whole bagful of diamonds and to haul em out of your pocket and lay em on the table there before him
I wonder he said slowly as he put them away in his own pocket what a man like me could do for a girl like you
Reform her
I snarled
Show her how to get diamonds honestly
Say Tom lets go in for bigger game
III
Oh Mag Mag for heavens sake let me talk to you
No dont say anything
You must let me tell you
Nodont call the other girls
I cant bear to tell this to anybody but you
You know how I kicked when Tom hit on Latimers as the place we were to scuttle
And the harder I kicked the stubborner he got till he swore hed do the job without me if I wouldnt come along
Wellthis is the rest of it
The house you know stands at the end of the street
If you could walk through the garden with the iron fence youd come right down the bluff on to the docks and out into East River
Tom and I came up to it from the docks last night
It was dark and wet you remember
The mud was thick on my trousersNance Oldens a boy every time when it comes to doing business
Well blow it all in Tom I said as we climbed
Well spend a week at the Waldorf and then Tom Dorgan well go to Paris
I want a red coat and hat with chinchilla like that dear one I lost and a lowneck satin gown and a silk petticoat with lace and a chain with rhinestones and Just wait Sis till you get out of this
And keep still
I cant
Im so fidgety I must talk or Ill shriek
Well youll shut up just the same
Do you hear me
I shut up but my teeth chattered so that Tom stopped at the gate
Look here Nance are you going to flunk
Say it nowyes or no
That made me mad
Tom Dorgan I said Ill bet your own teeth chattered the first time you went in for a thing like this
Im all right
Youll squeal before I do
Thats more like
Heres the gate
Its locked
Come Nance
With a good strong swing he boosted me over handed me the bag of tools and sprang over himself



He looked kind o handsome and fine my Tom as he lit square and light on his feet beside me
And because he did I put my arm in his and gave it a squeeze
Oh Mag it was so funny going through Latimers garden
There was the garden table where I had sat reading and thinking he took me for Miss Omar
There was the bench where that beast Moriway sat sneering at me
The wheeled chair was gone
And it was so late everything looked asleep
But something was left behind that made me think I heard Latimers slow silken voice and made me feel cheapturned inside out like an empty pocketa dirty ragged pocket with a seam in it
Youll stay here Nancy and watch Tom whispered
Youll whistle once if a cop comes inside the gate but not before hes inside the gate
Dont whistle too soonmind thatnor too loud
Ill hear ye all right
And Ill whistle just once ifanything happens
Then you runhear me
Run like the devil Tommy Well what
Nothingall right
I wanted to say goodbybut you know Tom
Mag were you ever where you oughtnt to be at midnightalone
No I know you werent
Twas your ugly little face and your hair that saved youthe red hair we used to guy so at the Cruelty
I can see you nowa frecklefaced thin little devil with the tangled hair to the very edge of your ragged skirt yanked in that first day to the Cruelty when the neighbors complained your crying wouldnt let em sleep nights
The old woman had just locked you in there hadnt she to starve when she lit out
Mothers are queer aint they when they are queer
I never remember mine
Yes Ill go on
I stood it all right for a time out there alone in the night
But I never was one to wait patiently
I cant waitit isnt in me
But there I had to stand and justGodjust wait
If I hadnt waited so hard at the very first I wouldnt a given out so soon
But I stood so still and listened so terribly hard that the trees began to whisper and the bushes to crack and creep
I heard things in my head and ears that werent sounding anywhere else
And all of a suddentramp tramp trampI heard the cops footsteps
He stopped over there by the swinging electric light above the gate
I crouched down behind the iron bench
And my coat caught a twig on a bush and its crackck was like a yell
I thought Id die
I thought Id scream
I thought Id run
I thought Id faint
But I didntfor there asleep on a rug that some one had forgotten to take in was the house cat
I gave her a quick slap and she flew out and across the path like a flash
The cop watched her his hand on the gate and passed on
Mag Monahan if Tom had come out that minute without a bean and gone home with me Id been so relieved Id never have tried again
But he didnt come
Nothing happened
Nights and nights and nights went by and the stillness began to sound again
My throat went choking mad
I began to shiver and I reached for the rug the cat had lain on
Funny how some things strike you
This was Latimers rug
I had noticed it that eveninga warm soft mottled green that looked like silk and fur mixed
I could see the way his long white hands looked on it and as I touched it I could hear his voice Oh Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make And evn with Paradise devise the Snake For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man Is blackendMans forgiveness giveand take
Ever hear a man like that say a thing like that
No
Well itsits different
Its as if the river had spokenor a treeits soits so different
That saved methat verse that I remembered
I said it over and over and over again to myself
I fitted it to the ferry whistles on the bayto the cops steps as they passed againto the roar of the Ltrain and the jangling of the surface cars
And right in the middle of itevery drop of blood in my body seemed to leak out of me and then come rushing back to my headI heard Toms whistle
Oh its easy to say run and I really meant it when I promised Tom
But you see I hadnt heard that whistle then
When it came it changed everything
It set the devil in me loose
I felt as if the world was tearing something of mine away from me
Stand for it
Not Nance Olden
I did runbut it was toward the house
That whistle may have meant Go
To me it yelled Come
I got in through the window Tom had left open
The place was still quiet
Nobody inside had heard that whistle so far as I could tell
I crept alongthe carpets were thick and soft and silky as the rug Id had my hands buried in to keep em warm
Along a long hall and through a great room whose walls were thick with books I was making for a light I could see at the back of the house
Thats where Tom Dorgan must be and where I must be to find outto know
With my hands out in front of me I hurried but softly and just as I had reached the portieres below which the light streamed my arms closed about a thingcold as marble nakedI thought it was a dead body upright there and with a cry I pitched forward through the curtains into the lighted room
Nanceyou devil
You recognize it
Yep it was Tom
Big Tom Dorgan at the foot of Latimers bed his hands above his head and Latimers gun aimed right at his heart
Think of the pluck of that cripple will you
His eyes turned on me for just a second and then fixed themselves again on Tom
But his voice went straight at me all right
You are something of a thankless devil I must admit MissOmar he said
I didnt say anything
You dont say things in answer to things like that
You feel em
Ashamed
What do I care for a man with a voice like that



But you should have heard how Toms growl sounded after it
Why the hell didnt you light out
I couldnt Tom
I justcouldnt I sobbed
There seems invariably to be a misunderstanding of signals where Miss Omar is concerned
Also a disposition to use strong language in the ladys presence
Dont you young man
Dont you call me Miss Omar
I blazed stamping my foot
He laughed a contemptuous laugh
I could have killed him then I hated him so
At least I thought I could but just then Tom sent a spark out of the corner of his eye to me that meantit meant You know Mag what it would have meant to Latimer if I had done what Toms eye said
I thought at first I had done itit passed through my mind so quick the sweet words Id saythe move Id makethe quick knockingup of the pistol and then It was thatthat sight of Tom big Tom Dorgan with rage in his heart and death in his hand leaping on that cripples bodyit made me sick
I stood there gaspingstood a moment too long
For the curtains were pushed aside and Burnett Latimers servant and the cop came in
Tom didnt fight hes no fool to waste himself
But Iwell never mind about me
I caught a glimpse of a crazy white face on a boys body in the great glass opposite and heard my own voice break into something Id never heard before
Tom stood at last with the handcuffs on
Its your own fault you damned little chump
he said to me as they went out
You lie Mag Monahan hes no such thing
He may be a hard man to live with but hes minemy Tommy Tom
What
Latimer
Well do you know its funny about him
Hed told the cop that Id peachedpeached on Tom
So they went off without me
Why
Thats what he said himself when we were alone
In order to insure for myself another of your most interesting visits I suppose Missnot Omar
All right



Tell me can I do nothing for you
Arent you sick of this sort of life
Get Tom out of jail
He shook his head
Im too good a friend of yours to do you such a turn
I dont want any friend that isnt Toms
He threw the pistol from him and pulled himself up till he sat looking at me
In heavens name what can you see in a fellow like that
Whats that to you
I turned to go
To me
Things of that sort are nothing of course to meme that luckless Pot He marrd in making
But tell mecan a girl like you tell the truth
What made you hesitate when that fellow told you with his eyes to murder me
How did you know
How
The glass
See over yonder
I could watch every expression on both your faces
What was itwhat was it child that made youoh if you owe me a single heartbeat of gratitude tell me the truth
Youve said it yourself
What
That line we read the other night about the luckless Pot
His face went gray and he fell back on his pillows
The strenuous life wed been leading him Tom and I was too much for him I guess
Do you know I really felt sorry Id said it
But he is a cripple
Did he expect me to say he was big and strong and dashinglike Tom
I left him there and got out and away
But do you know what I saw Mag beside his bed just as Burnett came to put me out
My old blue coat with the buttonsthe bellboys coat Id left in the housekeepers room when I borrowed her Sunday rig
The coat was hanging over a chair and right by it on a table was that big book with a picture covering every page still open at that verse about Through this same Gardenand for ONE in vain
IV
Nonono
No more whining from Nance Olden
Listen to what Ive got to tell you Mag listen
You know where I was coming from yesterday when I passed Troyons window and grinned up at you sitting there framed in bottles of hair tonic with all that red wig of yours streaming about you
Yep from that little rateyed lawyers office
I was glum as mud
I felt as though Tom and myself were both flies caught by the leghe by the law and I by the lawyerin a sticky mess and the more we flapped our wings and struggled and pulled the more we hurt and tore ourselves and the sooner wed have to give it up
Oh that wizenfaced little lawyer that lives on the Tom Dorgans and the Nance Oldens who dont know which way to turn to get the money
He looks at me out of his red little eyes and measures in dollars what Id do for Tom
And then he sets his price a notch higher than that
When I passed the big department store next to Troyons I was thinking of this and I turned in there just aching for some of the boodle that flaunts itself in a poor girls face when shes desperate from every silk and satin rag from every lace and jewel in the place
The funny part of it is that I didnt want it for myself but for Tom
Pon my soul Mag though I would have filled my arms with everything I saw I wouldnt have put on one thing of all the duds just hiked off to soak em and pay the lawyer
I might have been as old and ugly and rich as the yellowskinned woman opposite me who was turning over laces on the middle counter for all these things meant to mewith Tom in jail
I was thinking this as I looked at her when all at once I saw You know it takes a pretty quick touch sharp eyes and good nerve to get away with the goods in a big shop like that
Or it takes something altogether different
It was the different way she did it
She took up the piece of laceit was a big collar fine like a cobweb picture in threadsyou can guess what it must have been worth if that old sinner Mother Douty gave me fifteen dollars for it
She took it up in a quick eager way as though shed found just what she wanted
Then she took out a lace sample from her goldlinked purse and held them both up close to her blinky little eyes looking at it through a gold lorgnette with emeralds in the handle pulling it and feeling it with the air of one who knows a fine thing when she sees it and just what makes it fine
Then she rustled off to the door to examine it closely in the light andMag Monahan she walked right out with it
At least shed got beyond the inner doors when I tapped her on the shoulder
I beg pardon madam
My best style Mag
She pulled herself up haughtily and blinked at me
She was a little thin mummy of a woman just wrapped away in silks and velvets but on the inside of that nervous little old body of hers there must have been some spring of good material that wasnt all unwound yet
She stood blinking at me without a word
That lace
You havent paid for it I said
Her shortsighted eyes fell from my face to the collar she held in her hand
Her yellow face grew ghastly
Oh mercy
Youyou dont I am a detective for the store and But Sh
We dont like any noise made about these things and you yourself wouldnt enjoy Do you know who I am young woman
She fumbled in her satchel and passed a card to me
Glory be
Guess Mag
Oh youd never guess you dear old Mag
Besides you havent got the acquaintance in high society that Nance Olden can boast
   Mrs MILLS D VAN WAGENEN    OhMag
Shame on you not to know the name even of the Bishop of the great state ofyes the lean short little Bishop with a little white beard and the softest eye and the softest heart and my very own Bishop Nancy Oldens Bishop
And this was his wife
Tuttut Mag
Of course not
A bishops wife may be a kleptomaniac its only Cruelty girls that really steal from stores
Ive met the Bishop Mrs Van Wagenen
I didnt say how she wouldnt appreciate that story
And he was once very kind to me
But he would be the first to tell me to do my duty now
Ill do it as quietly as I can for his sake
But you must come with me or I must arrest She put up a shaking hand
Dear little old guy
Dontdont say it
Its all a mistake which can be rectified in a moment
Ive been trying to match this piece of lace for years
I got it at Malta whenwhen Mills and Ion our honeymoon
When I saw it there on the counter I was so delightedI never thoughtI intended taking it to the light to be sure the pattern was the same my eyesight is so wretchedand when you spoke to me it was the first inkling I had that I had really taken it without paying
You certainly understand she pleaded in agitation
I have no need to stealyou must know thatoh that I wouldntthatI couldntIf you will just let me pay you Here now Mag Monahan dont you get to sneering
She was straightright on the level all right
You couldnt listen to that cracked little voice of hers a minute without being sure of it
I was just about to permit her graciously to pay me the moneyfor my friend
the dear Bishops sake of coursewhen a big floorwalker happened to catch sight of us
If youll come with me Mrs Van Wagenen to a dressingroom Ill arrange your collar for you I said very loud
And then in a whisper Of course I understand but the thing may look different to other people
And that big floorwalker there gets a commission from the newspapers every time he tells them She gave a squawk for all the world like a driedup little hen scuttling out of a yellow dogs way and we took the elevator to the second floor
The minute I closed the door of the little fittingroom she held out the lace to me
I have changed my mind she said and shall give you the lace back
I will not keep it
I can notI can not bear the sight of it
It terrifies me and shocks me
I can take no pleasure in it
Besidesbesides it will be discipline for me to do without it now that I have found it after all these years
Every day I shall look at the place in my collection which it would have occupied and I shall say to myself Maria Van Wagenen take warning
See to what terrible straits a worldly passion may bring one what unconscious greed may do
I shall give the money to Mills for charity and I will nevernever fill that place in my collection
What good will that do
I asked puzzled while I folded the collar up into a very small package
You mean that I ought to submit to the exposurethat I deserve the lesson and the punishmentnot for stealing but for being absorbed in worldly things
Perhaps you are right
It certainly shows that you have at some time been under Mills spiritual care my dear
I wonder if he would insistwhether I oughtyes I suppose he would
Oh
A saleswomans head was thrust in the door
Excuse me she said I thought the room was empty
Weve just finished trying on I said sweetly
Dont go
The Bishops wife turned to her her little fluttering hands held out appealingly
And do not misunderstand me
The thing may seem wrong in your eyes as this young woman says but if you will listen patiently to my explanations I am sure you will see that it was a mere eager oversightthe fault of absentmindedness hardly the sin of covetousness and surely not a crime
I am making this confession The tender conscience of the dear blameless little soul
She was actually giving herself away
Worseshe was giving me away too
But I couldnt stand that
I saw the saleswomans puzzled faceshe was a tall woman with a big bust big hips and the big head all right and she wore her longtrain black rig for all the world like a Cruelty girl who had stolen the matrons skirt to play lady in
I got behind little Mrs Bishop and looking out over her head I tapped my forehead significantly
The saleswoman tumbled
That was all right
But so did the Bishops wife for she turned and caught me at it
You shall not save me from myself and what I deserve she cried
I am perfectly sane and you know it and you are doing me no favor in trying to create the contrary impression
I demand an An interview with the manager I interrupted
Im sure Mrs Van Wagenen can see the manager
Just go with the lady Mrs Van Wagenen and Ill follow with the goods
She did it meek as a lamb talking all the time but never beginning at the beginningluckily for me
So that I had time to slip from one dressingroom to the next with the lace up my sleeve out to the elevator and down into the street
Dye know what heaven must be Mag
A place where you always get away with the swag and where its always just the minute after youve made a killing
Cocky
Well I should say I was
I was drunk enough with success to take big chances
And just while I was wishing for something really big to tackle it came along in the shape of that big floorwalker
He was without a hat and his eyes looked fifty ways at once
But youve got to look fiftyone if you want to catch Nance Olden
I ran up the stairs of the first flathouse and rang the bell
And as I sailed up in the elevator I saw the big floorwalker hurry past hed lost the scent
The boy let me off at the top floor and after the elevator had gone down I walked up to the roof
It was fine way up there so still and high with the lights coming out down in the town
And I took out my pretty lace collar and put it around my neck wishing I could keep it and wishing that I had at least a glass to see myself in it just once when my eye caught the window of the next house
It would do for a mirror all right for the dark green shade was down
But at sight of the shade blowing in the wind I forgot all about the collar
Its this way Mag when they press you too far and that little rat of a lawyer had got me most to the wall
I looked at the window measuring the little climb it would be for me to get to itthe house next door was just one story higher than the one where I was so its top story was on a level with the roof nearly where I stood
And I made up mymind to get what would let Tom off easy or break into jail myself
And so I didnt care much what I might fall into through that window
And perhaps because I didnt care I slipped into a dark hall and not a thing stirred not a footstep creaked
I felt like the PrincessPrincess Nancy Oldencome to wake the Sleeping Beauty some dude itd be that would have curly hair like Tom Dorgans and would wear clothes like my friend Latimers over in Brooklyn
Can you see me there standing on one leg like a stork ready to lie or to fly at the first sound
Well the first sound didnt come
Neither did the second
In fact none of em came unless I made em myself
Softly as Molly goes when the babys just dropped off to sleep I walked toward an open door
It was a parlor smelly with tobacco and with lots of papers and books around
And nary a hebeautynor any other kind
I tried the door of a room next to it
A bedroom
But no Beauty
Silly
Dont you tumble yet
It was a bachelors apartment and the Bachelor Beauty was out and Princess Nancy had the place all to herself
I suppose I really ought to have left my cardor he wouldnt know who had waked himbut I hadnt intended to go calling when I left home
So I thought Id look for one of his as a souvenirand anything else of his I could make use of
There were shirts Id liked for Tom dandy colored ones and suits with checks in em and without
But I wanted something easy and small and flat made of crackly printed yellow or green paper with numbers on it
How did I know he had anything like that
Why Mag Mag Monahan one would think you belonged to the Bishops set youre so simple
I had to turn on the electric light after a bitit got so dark
And I dont like light in other peoples houses when theyre not at home and neither am I
But there was nothing in the bedroom except some pearl studs
I got those and then went back to the parlor
The desk caught my eye
Oh Mag it had the loveliest pictures on itpictures of swell actresses and dancers
It was mahogany with lots of little drawers and two curvy side boxes
I pulled open all the drawers
They were full of papers all right but they were printed cut from newspapers and all about theaters
You cant feed things like this Nance to that shark of a lawyer I said to myself pushing the box on the side impatiently
And then I giggled outright
Why
Just causeI had pushed that side box till it swung aside on hinges I didnt know about and there in a little secret nest was a pile of those same crisp crinkly paper things Id been looking for
204060110160210260310
Three hundred and ten dollars Mag Monahan
Three hundred and ten and Nance Olden
Glory be
I whispered
Glory be damned
I heard behind me
I turned
The bills just leaked out of my hand on to the floor
The Bachelor Beauty had come home Mag and nabbed the poor Princess instead of her catching him napping
He wasnt a beauty eithera big stout fellow with a black mustache
His hand on my shoulder held me tight but the look in his eyes behind his glasses held me tighter
I threw out my arms over the desk and hid my face
Caught
Nancy Olden with her hands dripping and not a lie in her smart mouth
He picked up the bills I had dropped counted them and put them in his pocket
Then he unhooked a telephone and lifted the stand from his desk
Hello
Spring 3100please
Hello
Chiefs office
This is Obermuller Standard Theater
I want an officer to take charge of a thief Ive caught in my apartments here at the Bronsonia
Yes right on the corner
Hold him till you come
Wellrather
He put down the phone
I pulled the pearl studs out of my pocket
You might as well take these too I said
So thoughtful of you seeing that youd be searched
But Ill take em anyway
You intended them forHim
You didnt get anything else
I shook my head as I lay there
Hum
It was half a laugh and half a sneer
I hated him for it as he sat leaning back on the back legs of his chair his thumbs in his armholes
I felt his eyesthose smart keen eyes burning into my miserable head
I thought of the lawyer and the deal hed give poor Tom and all at once Youd have sniffled yourself Mag Monahan
There I wascaught
The copd be after me in five minutes
With Tom jugged and me in stripesit wasnt very jolly and I lost my nerve
Ashamedhuh
he said lightly
I nodded
I was ashamed
Pity you didnt get ashamed before you broke in here
What the devil was there to be ashamed of
The sting in his voice had cured me
I never was a weeper
I sat up my face blazing and stared at him
Hed got me to hand over to the cop but he hadnt got me to sneer at
I saw by the look he gave me that he hadnt really seen me till then
Well he answered what the devil is there to be ashamed of now
Of being caughtthats what
Oh
He tilted back again on his chair and laughed softly
Then youre not ashamed of your profession
Are you of yours
Welltheres a slight difference
Not much whatever it may be
Its your graftits everybodysto take all he can get and keep out of jail
Thats mine too
But you see I keep out of jail
I see youre not thereyet
Oh I think you neednt worry about that
Ill keep out thank you imprisonment for debt dont go nowadays
Debt
Im a theatrical manager my girl and Im not on the inside which is another way of saying that a man who cant swim has fallen overboard
And when you do go down A little less exultation my dear or I might suppose youd be glad when I do
Well when you know yourself going down for the last time do you mean to tell me you wont grasp at a straw likelike this
I nodded toward the open window and the desk with all its papers tumbling out
Not much
He shook his head and bit the end of a cigar with sharp white teeth
Its a fool graft
Im selfrespecting
And I dont admire fools
He lit his cigar and puffed a minute taking out his watch to look at it as coldbloodedly as though we were waiting he and I to go to supper together
Oh how I hated him
Honesty isnt the best policy he went on its the only one
The vain fool that gets it into his heador shall I say her head
No
Well no offense I assure youhis head then that hes smarter than a world full of experience ought to be put in jailfor his own protection hes too big a jay to be left out of doors
For five thousand years more or less the world has been putting people like him behind bars where they cant make asses of themselves
Yet each year and every day and every hour a new ninny is born who fancies hes cleverer than all his predecessors put together
Talk about suckers
Why theyre giants of intellect compared to the mentally lopsided that five thousand years of experience cant teach
When the criminalclowns turn comes he hops skips and jumps into the ring with the old old gag
He thinks its new because he himself is so fresh and green
Here I am again he yells the fellow thatll do you up
Others have tried it
Theyre dead in jail or under jailyards
But mejust watch me
We do and after a little we put him with his mates and a keeper in a barred kindergarten where fools that cant learn little moral cripples of both sexes my dear belong
Bah
He puffed out the smoke throwing his head back in a cloud toward the ceiling
I sprang from my seat and faced him
I was tingling all through
I didnt care a rap what became of me for just that minute
I forgot about Tom
I prayed that the cop wouldnt come for a minute yetbut only that I might answer him
Youre mighty smart aint you
You can sit back here and sneer at me cant you
And feel so big and smart and triumphant
Whatve you done but catch a girl at her first bungling job
It makes you feel awfully cocky dont it
What a big man am I
Bah
I blew the smoke up toward the ceiling from my mouth with just that satisfied gall that he had had or rather I pretended to
He let down the front legs of his chair and began to stare at me
And you dont know it all Mr
Manager not you
Your clowncriminal dont jump into the ring because hes so full of fun he cant stay out
He goes in for the same reason the real clown doesbecause he gets hungry and thirsty and sleepy and tired like other men and hes got to fill his stomach and cover his back and get a place to sleep
And its because your kind gets too much that my kind gets so little it has to piece it out with this sort of thing
No you dont know it quite all
Theres a girl named Nancy Olden that could tell you a lot smart as you are
She could show you the inside of the Cruelty where she was put so young she never knew that children had mothers and fathers till a redhaired girl named Mag Monahan told her and then she was mighty glad she hadnt any
She thought that all little girls were bloodless and dirty and all little boys were filthy and had black purple marks where their fathers had tried to gouge out their eyes
She thought all women were like the matron who came with a visitor up to the bare room where we played without toysthe new dirty newlybruised ones of us and the old clean healing ones of usand said Here chicks is a lady whos come to see you
Tell her how happy you are here
Then Mags freckled little face her finger in her mouth looked up like this
She was always afraid it might be her mother come for her
And the crippled boy jerked himself this wayI used to mimic him and hed laugh with the rest of themover the bare floor
He always hoped for a penny
Sometimes he even got it
And the boy with the gouged eyehe would hold his pants up like this
He had just come in and there was nothing to fit him
And hed put his other hand over his bad eye and blink up at her like this
And the littlest boyoh ha
ha
hayou ought have seen that littlest boy
He was in skirts an old dress theyd given me to wear the first day I came there were no pants small enough for him
Hed back up into the corner and hide his facelike thisand peep over his shoulder he had a squint that way that made his face so funny
See it makes you laugh yourself
But his bodymy Godit was blue with welts
And meId put the baby down thatd been left on the doorsteps of the Cruelty and Id waltz up to the lady the nice patronizing rich lady with her handkerchief to her nose and her lorgnette to her eyessee like this
I knew just what graft would work her
I knew what she wanted there
Id learned
So Id make her a curtsy like this and in the piousest singsong Id There was a heavy step out in the hallit was the policeman
Id forgot while I was talking
I was backback in the empty garret at the top of the Cruelty
I could smell the smell of the poor the dirty weak sick poor
I could taste the porridge in the thick little bowls like those in the bear story Molly tells her kid
I could hear the stifled sobs that wise poor children givequiet ones so theyll not be beaten again
I could feel the night when strange deserted tortured babies lie for the first time each in his small white cot the new ones waking the old with their cries in a nightmare of what had happened before they got to the Cruelty
I could see the world barred over as I saw it first through the Crueltys barred windows and as I must see it again now that You see you dont know it quite allyet Mr
Manager
I spat it out at him and then walked to the cop my hands ready for the bracelets
But theres one thing I do know
Hes a big fellow but quick on his feet and in a minute he was up and between me and the cop
And there isnt a theatrical man in all America that knows it quicker than Fred Obermuller that can detect it sooner and develop it better
And youve got it girl youve got it



Officer take this for your trouble
I couldnt hold the fellow after all
Never mind which way he went Ill call up the office and explain
He shut the door after the cop and came back to me
I had fallen into a chair
My knees were weak and I was trembling all over
Have you seen the playlet Charity at the Vaudeville
he roared at me
I shook my head
Well its a scene in a foundling asylum
Heres a pass
Go up now and see it
If you hurry youll get there just in time for that act
Then if you come to me at the office in the morning at ten Ill give you a chance as one of the Charity girls
Do you want it
God Mag
Do I want it
V Do you remember Lady Patronesses Day at the Cruelty Mag
Remember how the place smelt of cleaning ammonia on the bare floors
Remember the black dresses we all wore and the white aprons with the little bibs and the oily sweetness of the matron and how our faces shone and tingled from the soap and the rubbing
Remember it all
Well whod a thought then that Nance Olden ever would make use of iton the level too
Drop the Cruelty and tell you about the stage
Why its bare boards back there bare as the Cruelty but oh theres something that you dont see but you feel itsomething magic that makes you want to pinch yourself to be sure youre awake
I go round there just doped with it my face if you could see it must look like Mollys kids when she is telling him fairy stories
I love it Mag
I love it
And what do I do
Thats what I was trying to tell you about the Cruelty for
Its in a little act that was made for Lady Gray that there are four Charity girls on the stage and Im one of em
Lady Gray
Why Mag how can you ever hope to get on if you dont know whos who
How can you expect me to associate with you if youre so ignorant
Yesa real Lady as real as the wife of a Lord can be
Lord Harold Grays a sure enough Lord and shes his wife butbut a chippy just the same thats what she is in spite of the Gray emeralds and that great Gray rose diamond she wears on the tiniest chain around her scraggy neck
Do you know Mag Monahan that this Lady Harold Gray was just a chorus girland a sweet chorus it must have been if she sang therewhen she nabbed Lord Harold
Youd better keep your eye on Nancy Olden or first thing you know shell marry the Czar of Russiaor Tom Dorgan poor fellow when he gets out



Well just the same Mag if that whitefaced scrawny little creature can be a Lady a girl with ten times her brains and at least half a dozen times her good looksoh were not shy on the stage Mag about throwing bouquets at ourselves
Can she act
Dont be silly Mag
Cant you see that Obermullers just hiring her title and playing it in big letters on the bills for all its worth
She acts the Lady Patroness come to look at us Charity girls
She comes on though looking like a fairy princess
Her dress is just blazing with diamonds
Theres the Ladys coronet in her hair
Her thin little arms are banded with gold and diamonds and on her neckO Mag Mag that rose diamond is the color of roseleaves in a fountains jet through which the sun is shining
Its longlong as my thumbI swear it is Magnearly and it blazes oh it blazes Well it blazes dollars into Obermullers box all right for the Gray jewels are advertised in the bill with this one at the head of the list the star of them all
You see its this way Lord Harold Grays bankrupt
Hes poor asas Nance Olden
Isnt that funny
But hes got the family jewels all right to have as long as he lives
Nary a one can he sell though for after his death they go to the next Lord Gray
So he makes em make a living for him and as they cant go on and exhibit themselves Lady Gray sports emand draws down two hundred dollars a week
Yeptwo hundred
But do you know it isnt the two hundred dollars a week that makes me envy her till Im sick its that rose diamond
If you could only see it Mag youd sympathize with me and understand why my fingers just itched for it the first night I saw her come on
Pon my soul Mag the sight of it blazing on her neck dazzled me so that it shut out all the staring audience that first night and I even forgot to have stage fright
Whats doped you Olden
Obermuller asked when the curtain went down and we all hurried to the wings
I was in the black dress with the whitebibbed apron and I looked up at him still dazed by the shine of that diamond and my longing for it
Youd almost kill with your own hands for a diamond like that Mag
Doped
Whywhat didnt I do
I asked him
Thats just it he said looking at me curiously but I could feel his disappointment in me
You didnt do anythingnot a blasted thing more than you were told to do
The worlds full of supers that can do that
For just a minute I forgot the diamond
Thenits a mistake
You were wrong andand I cant be an actress
He threw back his head before he answered puffing a mouthful of smoke up at the ceiling as he did the night he caught me
The gesture itself seemed to remind him of what had made him think in the first place he could make an actress of me
For he laughed down at me and I saw he remembered
Well he said well wait and see


I was mistaken though sure enough about one thing that night
I looked up at him
Youre a darn sight prettier than I thought you were
The gold brick you sold me isnt all He put out his hand to touch my chin
I sidestepped and he turned laughing to the stage
But he called after me
Is a beauty success going to content you Olden
Well well wait and see I drawled back at him in his own throaty bass
Oh I was drunk Mag drunk with thinking about that diamond
I didnt care even to please Obermuller
I just wanted the feel of that diamond in my hand
I wanted it lying on my own neckthe lovely cool shining rosy thing
Its like the sunrise Mag that beauty stone
Its just a tiny pool of water blushing
Its How to get it
How to get away with it
On what wed get for that diamond Tom and Iwhen his time is upcould live for all our lives and whoop it up besides
We could live in Paris where great grafters live and grafting payswhere if youve got wit and fifty thousand dollars and happen to be a darn sight prettier you can just spin the world around your little finger
But do you know even then I couldnt bear to think of selling the pretty thing
It hurt me to think of anybody having it but just Nance Olden
But I hadnt got it yet
Gray has a dressingroom to herself
And on her tablewhich is a big box open end downjust where the threesided big mirror can multiply the jewels and make you want em three times as bad her big russialeather silvermounted box lies open while shes dressing and undressing
Other times its locked tight and his Lordship himself has it tight in his own right hand or his Lordships man Topham has it just as tight
How to get that diamond
There was a hard nut for Nance Oldens sharp teeth to crack
I only wanted thatnever say Im greedy MagGray could keep all the rest of the thingsthe pigeon in rubies and pearls the tiara all in diamonds the chain of pearls and the blazing rings and the waisttrimming all of emeralds and diamond stars
But that diamond that huge rose diamond I couldnt I just couldnt let her have it
And yet I didnt know the first step to take toward getting it till Beryl Blackburn helped me out
Shes one of the Charities like mea tall bleached blonde with a pretty pale face and goldgray eyes
And if youd believe her theres not a man in the audience afternoon or evening that isnt deadgone on her
Guess whos my latest she said to me this afternoon while we four Charities stood in the wings waiting
Tophamold Topham
It all got clear to me then in a minute
Tophamnothing
I sneered
Beryl Bighead Topham thinks of only one thingMiladys jewelbox
Dont you fool yourself
Oh does he Miss
Well just to prove it he let me try on the rose diamond last night
There
Its easy to say so but I dont see the proof
Hed lose his job so quick itd make his head spin if he did it
Not if he did but if they knew he did
Youll not tell
Not me
Why would I
I dont believe it and I wouldnt expect anybody else to
I dont believe you could get Topham to budge from his chair in Grays dressingroom if youd Whatll you bet
Ill bet you the biggest box of chocolate creams at Huylers
Done
Ill send for him tonight just before Gray and her Lord come and you see Howll I see
Wherell I be
Well you be waiting in the little hall right of Grays dressingroom at seventhirty tonight andyou might as well bring the creams with you
Catch on Mag
At seventhirty in the evening I was waiting but not in the little hall of Grays dressingroom
I hadnt gone home at all after the afternoon performanceyou know we play at three and again at eightthirty
I had just hidden me away till the rest were gone and as soon as the coast was clear I got into Grays dressingroom pushed aside the chintz curtains of the big box that makes her dressingtableand waited
Lord how the hours dragged
I hadnt had anything to eat since lunch and it got darker and darker in there and hot and close and cramped
I put in the time much as I could thinking of Tom
The very first thing Id do after cashing in would be to get up to Sing Sing to see him
Im crazy to see him
Id tell him the news and see if he couldnt bribe a guard or plan some scheme with me to get out soon
Afraidme
What of
If they found me under that box Id just give em the Beryl story about the bet
How do you know they wouldnt believe it



Oh I dont care youve got to take chances Mag Monahan if you go in for big things
And this was bighuge
Do you know how much that diamonds worth
And do you know how to spend fifty thousand
I spent it all therein the boxevery penny of it
When I got tired spending money I dozed a bit and in my dream spent it over again
And then I waked and tried to fancy new ways of getting rid of it but my head ached and my back ached and my whole body was so strained and cramped that I was on the point of giving it all up whenthat blessed old Topham came in
He set the big box down with a bang that nearly cracked my head
He turned on the lights and stood whistling Tommy Atkins
And then suddenly there came a soft call Topham
Topham
I leaned back and bit my fingers till I knew I wouldnt shriek
The Englishman listened a minute
Then the call came again and Topham creaked to the door and out
In a twinkling I was out too you bet
Mag
He hadnt opened the box at all
There it stood in the middle of the space framed by the three glasses
I pulled at the lid
Locked
I could have screamed with rage
But the sound of his step outside the door sobered me
He was coming back
In a frantic hurry I turned toward the window which I had unlocked when I came in four hours ago
But I hadnt time to make it
I heard the old fellows hand on the door and I tumbled back into the box in such a rush that the curtains were still waving when he came in
Slowly he began to place the jewels one by one in the order her Ladyship puts them on
We Charity girls had often watched him from the doorhe never let one of us put a foot inside
He was method and order itself
He never changed the order in which he lifted the glittering things out nor the places he put them back in
I put my hand up against the top of the box tracing the spot where each piece would be lying
Think Mag just half an inch between me and quarter of a million
Oh I was sore as I lay there
And I wasnt so cocksure either that Id get out of it straight
I tried the Beryl story lots of ways on myself but somehow every time I fancied myself telling it to Obermuller it got tangled up and lay dumb and heavy inside of me
But at least it would be better to appear of my own will before the old Englishman than be discovered by Lord Gray and his Lady
I had my fingers on the curtains and in another second Id been out when Miss Beryl Blackburns compliments Mr Topham and would you step to the door as theres something most important she wants to tell you
Oh I loved every syllable that callboy spoke
There was a giggle behind his voice too old Topham was the butt of every joke
The first call which had fooled me must have been from some giddy girl who wanted to guy the old fellow
She had fooled me all right
But thisthis one was the real article
There was a pauseTopham must be looking about to be sure things were safe
Then he creaked to the door and shut it carefully behind him
It only took a minute but in that minutein that minute Mag I had the rose diamond clutched safe in my fingers I was on the top of the big trunk and out of the window
Oh the feel of that beautiful thing in my hand
Id a loved it if it hadnt been worth a penny but as it was I adored it
I slipped the chain under my collar and the diamond slid down my neck and I felt its kiss on my skin
I flew down the black corridor bumping into scenery and nearly tripping two stage carpenters
I heard Ginger the callboy ahead of me and dodged behind some properties just in time
He went whistling past and I got to the stage door
I pulled it open tenderly cautiously and turned to shut it after me
And And something held it open in spite of me
Nono Mag it wasnt a man
It was a memory
It rose up there and hit me right over the heartthe memory of Nancy Oldens happiness the first time shed come in this very door feeling that she actually had a right to use a stage entrance feeling that she belonged sheNancyto this wonderland of the stage
You must never tell Tom Mag promise
He wouldnt see
He couldnt understand
I couldnt make him know what I felt any more than Id dare tell him what I did
I shut the door
But not behind me
I shut it on the street andMag I shut for ever another door too the old door that opens out on Crooked Street
With my hand on my heart that was beating as though it would burst I flew back again through the black corridor through the wings and out to Obermullers office
With both my hands I ripped open the neck of my dress and pulling the chain with that great diamond hanging to it I broke it with a tug and threw the whole thing down on the desk in front of him
For Gods sake
I yelled
Dont make it so easy for me to steal
I dont know what happened for a minute
I could see his face change half a dozen ways in as many seconds
He took it up in his fingers at last
It swung there at the end of the slender little broken chain like a great drop of shining water blushing and sparkling and trembling
His hands trembled too and he looked up at last from the diamond to my face
Its worth at least fifty thousand you knowvalued at that
I didnt answer
He got up and came over to where I had thrown myself on a bench
Whats the matter Olden
Dont I pay you enough
I want to see Tom I begged
Its so long since heHes up atatin the country
Sing Sing
I nodded
You poor little devil
That finished me
Im not used to being pitied
I sobbed and sobbed as though some dam had broken inside of me
You see Mag I knew in that minute that Id been afraid deathly afraid of Fred Obermullers face when its scornful and sarcastic and of his voice when it cuts the flesh of selfconceit off your very bones
And the contrastwell it was too much for me
But something came quick to sober me
It was Gray
She stormed in followed by Lord Harold and Topham and half the company
The diamond the rose diamond
she shrieked
Its gone
And the carpenters say that new girl Olden came flying from the direction of my dressingroom
Ill hold you responsible Hushsh
Obermuller lifted his hands and nodded over toward me
Olden
she squealed
Grab her Topham
Ill bet she stole that diamond and she cant have got rid of it yet
Topham jumped toward me but Obermuller stopped him
Youd win only half your bet my Lady Obermuller said softly
She did get hold of the Gray rose worth fifty thousand dollars in spite of all your precautions The world seemed to fall away from me
I looked up at him
I couldnt believe hed go back on me 
And she brought it straight to me as I had asked her to and promised to raise her salary if shed win out
For I knew that unless I proved to you it could be stolen youd never agree to hire a detective to watch those things which will get us all into trouble some day
Here
Scoot out o this
Its nearly time for your number
He passed the diamond over to her and they all left the office
So did I but he held out his hand as I passed
It goesthat about a raise for you Olden
Now earn it
Isnt he white Magwhite clean through that big fellow Obermuller
VI
I got into the train Mag the happiest girl in all the country
Id a big basket of things for Tom
I was got up in my Sunday best for I wanted to make a hit with some fellow with a key up there whod make things soft and easy for my Tommy
I had so much to tell him
I knew just how Id take off every member of the company to amuse him
I had memorized every joke Id heard since Id got behind the curtainnot very hard for me things always had a way of sticking in my mind
I knew the newest songs in town and the choruses of all the old ones
I could show him the latest tricks with cardsId got those at first hand from Professor Haughwout
You know how great Tom is on tricks
I could explain the disappearing woman mystery and the mirror cabinet
I knew the clog dance that Dewitt and Daniels do
I had pictures of the trained seals the great elephant act Mademoiselle Picotte doing her great tightrope dance and the Brothers Borodini in their pyramid tumbling
Yes it was a whole vaudeville show with refreshments between the acts that I was taking up to Tom Dorgan
I dont care much for a lot of that truckfunny isnt it how you get to turn up your nose at the things youd have given a finger for once upon a time
But Tomoh Id got everything pat for himmy big handsome Tom Dorgan in stripeswith his curls all shaved offugh
Id got just so far in my thoughts sitting there in the train when I gave a shiver
I thought for a minute it was at the idea of my Tom with one of those bare round convictheads on him that look like fat skeleton faces
But it wasnt
It was Guess Mag
Moriway
Both of us thought the same thing of each other for the first second that our eyes met
I could see that
He thought I was caught at last
And I thought hed been sharp once too often
And Mag it would be hard to say which of us would have been happier if it had been the truth
Oh to meet Moriway bound sure enough for Sing Sing
He got up and came over to me smiling wickedly
Se took the seat behind me and leaning forward said softly Is Miss Omar engaged to read to some invalid up at Sing Sing
And for how long a termI should say engagement
Id got through shivering by then
I was ready for him
I turned and looked at him in that very polite distant sort o way Gray uses in her act when the Charity superintendent speaks to her
Its the only decent thing she does chances are that thats how Lord Grays mother looks at her
You know my sister MrMr I asked humbly
He looked at me perplexed for just a second
Sister be hanged
he said at last
I know you Nat and Im glad to my fingertips that youve got it in the neck in spite of all your smartness
Youre altogether wrong sir I said very stately but hurt a bit you know
Ive often been taken for my sister but gentlemen usually apologize when I explain to them
Its hard enough to have a sister who I looked up at him tearfully with my chin awabble with sorrow
He grinned
Liars should have good memories he sneered
Miss Omar said she was an orphan you remember and had not a relative in the world
Did she say that
Did Nora say that
I exclaimed piteously
Oh what a little liar she is
I suppose she thought it made her more interesting to be so alone more appealing to kindhearted gentlemen like yourself
I hope she wasnt ungrateful to you too as she was to that kind Mr Latimer before he found her out
And she had such a good position there too
I wanted to look at him oh I wanted to
But it was my role to sit there with downcast eyes justthe picture of holy grief
I was the good onethe good shocked sister and though I wasnt a bit afraid of anything he could do to me or any game he could put up I yearned to make him believe mejust because he was so suspicious so wickedly smart so sure he was on
But his very silence sort of told me he almost believed or that he was laying a trap
Will you tell me he said how youyour sister got Latimer to lie for her
Mr Latimerlie
Oh you dont know him
He expected a lady to read to him that very evening
He had never seen her and when Nora walked into the garden After getting a skirt somewhere
Yesthe housekeepers it happened to be her evening outwhy he just naturally supposed Nora was Miss Omar
Ah
then her name isnt Omar
What might it be
Id rather not tellif you dont mind
But when Latimer found out she had the diamondshe did find out
She confessed to him
Noras not really so bad a girl as Very interesting
But it doesnt happen to be Latimers version
And you say Latimer wouldnt lie
I got palebut the paleness was on the inside of me
Think I was going to flinch before a chump like Moriway even if I had walked straight into his trap
It isnt
I exclaimed
No
Latimers note to Mrs Kingdon said the diamonds were found in the bellboys jacket the thief had left behind him
Well
It only shows what a bad habit lying is
Nora must have fibbed to me for the pure pleasure of fibbing
Ill never dare to trust her again
Do you believe then that she didnt have anything to do with the hotel robbery
I do hope so
Its one less sin on her wicked head
Its hard having such a girl in the family
Oh wasnt I grieved
He looked me straight in the eye
I looked at him
I was unutterably sad about that tough sister of mine and I vow I looked holy then though I never did before and may never again
Well I only saw her in the twilight he said slowly watching my face all the time
You two sisters are certainly miraculously alike
The train was slowing down and I got up with my basket
I stood right before him my full face turned toward him
Are we
I asked simply
Dont you think its more the expression than anything else and the voice
Noras really much fairer than I am
Goodby
He watched me as I went out
I felt his eyes on the back of my jacket and I was tempted to turn at the door and make a face at him
But I knew something better and safer than that
I waited till the train was just pulling out and then standing below his window I motioned to him to raise it
He did
I thought you were going to get out here I called
Are you sure you dont belong in Sing Sing Mr
Moriway
I can see his face yet Mag and every time I think of it it makes me nearly die of laughing
He had actually been fooled another time
It was worth the trip up there to make a guy of him once more
And whether it was or not Mag it was all I got after all
Forwould you believe Tom Dorgan would turn out such a sorehead
Hes kicked up such a row ever since he got there that its the dark cell for him and solitary confinement
Think of itfor Tom
I begged I bluffed I cried I coaxed but manys the Nance Olden that has played her game against the rules of Sing Sing and lost
They wouldnt even let me leave the things for him or give him a message from me
And back to the station I had to carry the basket and all the schemes I had to make old Tom Dorgan grin
All the way back I had him in my mind
Hes a tigerTomwhen hes roused
I could see him shut up there by himself with not a soul to talk to with not a human eye to look into with not a thing on earth to doTom whos action itself
He never was much of a thinker and I never saw him read even a newspaper
What would he do to kill the time
Cant you see him there at bay back on his haunches cursing and cursed alone in the everlasting black silence
I saw nothing else
Wherever I turned my eyes that terrible picture was before me
And always it was just on the verge of becoming something elsesomething worse
He could throttle the world with his bare hands if it had but one neck in the mood he must be in now
It was when I couldnt bear it a moment longer that I set my mind to find something else to think of
I found it Mag
Do you know what it was
It was just three wordsof Obermullers Earn it now
After all Miss Monahan this graft of honesty they all preach so much about hasnt anything mysterious in it
All it is is putting your wits to work according to the rules of the game and not against them
I was driven to itthe thought of big Tom crouching for a spring in the dark cell up yonder sent me whirling out into the thinking place like the picture of the soul in the big book at Latimers I read out of
And first thing you know pon honor Mag it was as much fun planning how to earn it now as any lifting I ever schemed
Its getting the best of people that always charmed meand here was a way to fool em according to law
So busy I was making it all up that the train pulled into the station before I knew it
I gave a last thought to that poor old hyena of a Tom and then put him out of my mind
I had other fish to fry
Straight down to Mother Douty I went with my basket
A fool girl mother on her way up to Sing Sing lost her basket and Nance Olden found it it ought to be worth a good deal
She grinned
You couldnt make old Douty believe that the Lord himself wouldnt steal if He got a chance
And she knows the chances that come butting up against Nancy Olden
Why did I lie to her
Not for practice I assure you
Shed have beaten me down to the last cent if she thought it was mine but she always thinks therell be a find for her in something thats stolen
So I let her think Id stolen it in the railway station and we came to terms
With what she gave me I bought a wig
Mag I want you some day when you can get off to come and see that wig
I shouldnt wonder but youd recognize it
Its red of very coarse hair but a wonderful color and so long ityes it might be your own Mag Monahan its so much like it
I went to the theater and got my Charity rig took it home and sat for hours there just looking at em both
When evening came I was ready to earn it now
You see Obermuller had given me the whole day to be away and neither Gray nor the other three Charities expected me back
I had to do it on the sly you sassy Mag
Yes it was partly because I love to cheat but more because I was bound to have my chance once whether anybody else enjoyed it or not
I came to the theater in my Charity rig and the wig
It looked as if Id slept in it and it came down to the draggled hem of the skirt
All the way there I walked like you Mag
Once when a newsboy grinned at me and shouted Carrots
I grinned backyour own old Cruelty grin Mag
I vow I felt so much like youas you used to bethat when I lurched out on the stage at last stumbling over my shoe laces and trying to push the hair out of my eyes youd have sworn it was little Mag Monahan I making her debut in the Cruelty room
Oh Mag Mag you darling Mag
Did you ever hear a whole house a great big theater full of a peevish vaudeville audience just rise at you give one roar of laughter they hadnt expected at all to give and then settle down to giggle at every move you made
Girl alive I just had em
They couldnt take their eyes off me
If I squirmed they howled
If I stood on one foot scratching the torn leg of my stocking with the otheryou know Magthey yelled
If I grinned they just roared
Oh Mag cant you see
Dont you understand
I was It
The center of the stage I carried round with meit was just Nancy Olden
And for ten minutes Nancy had nothing to do but to play with em
Pon my life Mag its just like stealing the old graft exactly its so fascinating so busy and risky except that they play the game with you and pay you and love you to fool em
When the curtain fell it was different
Grays followed by the Charities all clean and spickandspan andnot in it not even on the edge of itstormed up to Obermuller standing at the wings
Ill quit the show here and now she squawked
Its a shame a beastly shame
How dare you play me such a trick Fred Obermuller
I never was treated so in my lifeto have that dirty little wretch come tumbling on like that without even so much as your telling me youd made up all this new business for her
Its indecent anyway
Why I lost my cue
There was a gap for a full minute
The whole act was such a ghastly failure that I That youd better go out now and make your prettiest bow Gray
Phew
Listen to the house roar
Thats what I call applause
Go on now
She went
Me
I didnt say a word
I looked at Obermuller andand I just did like this
Yes winked Mag Monahan
I was so crazily happy I had to didnt I
But do you know what he did
Do you know what he did
Well I suppose I am screaming and the Troyons will put me out buthe justwinkedback
And then Gray came trailing back into the wings and the shrieking and thumping and whistling out in front just went onand onand onand on
Um
I just listened and loved itevery thump of it
And I stood there like a demure little kitten or more like Mag Monahan after shed had a good licking and was good and quiet
And I never so much as budged till Obermuller said Well Nance you have earned it
The gall of you
But it only proves that Fred Obermuller never yet bought a gold brick
Only let me in on your racket next time
There go ontake it
Its yours
Oh to have Fred Obermuller say things like that to you
He gave me a bit of a push
Twas just a lovepat
I stumbled out on to the stage
VII
And thats why Marguerite de Monahan I want you to buy in with the madam here
Let em keep on calling it Troyons as much as they want but youre to be a partner on the money Ill give you
If this fairy story lasts itll be your own Maga sort of commission you get on my takeoff of you
But if anything happens to the worldif it should go crazy or get sane and not love Nancy Olden any more why herell be a place for me too
Does it look that way
Divil a bit you croaker
It looksit lookslisten and Ill tell you how it looks
It looks as though Gray and the great Gray rose diamond and the three Charities had all become a bit of background for Nance Olden to play upon
It looks as though the audience likes the sound of my voice as much almost as I do myself anyway as much as it does the sight of me
It looks as though the press if you please had discovered a new stage star for down comes a little reporter to interview meme Nancy Olden
Think of that Mag
I receive him all in my Charity rig and in Obermullers office and he asks me silly questions and I tell him a lot of nonsense but some truths too about the Cruelty
Fancy he didnt know what the Cruelty was
S P C C he calls it
And all the time we talked a longhaired German artist he had brought with him was sketching Nance Olden in different poses
Isnt that the limit
What dye think Tom Dorgand say to see half a page of Nancy Olden in the XRay
Wouldnt his eyes pop
Poor old Tom



No dangerthey wont let him have the papers



My old Tommy
What is it Mag
Oh what was I saying
Yesyes how it looks
Well it looks as though the Trustyes the big and mighty T Tshort for Theatrical Trust you innocenthad heard of that same Nance Olden you read about in the papers
For one night last week when Id just come of and the house was yelling and shouting behind me Obermuller meets me in the wings and trots me of to his private office
What for
I asked him on the way
Youll find out in a minute
Come on
I pulled up my stocking and followed
You know I wear it in that act without a garter and its always coming down the way yours used to Mag
Even when it doesnt come down I pull it up Im so in the habit of doing it
A little bit of a man baldheaded with a dyspeptic little black mustache turned down at the corners watched me come in
He grinned at my makeup and then at me
Clever little girl he says through his nose
How much do you stick Obermuller for
Clever little man say I bold as brass and through my own nose none of your business
Hiyou Olden
roared Obermuller as though Id run away and he was trying to get the bit from between my teeth
Answer the gentleman prettily
Dont you know a representative of the mighty T T when you see him
Cant you see the Syndicate aureole about his noble brow
This gentleman Nance is the great and only Max Tausig
He humbleth the exalted and uplifteth the lowlyor if theres more money in it he gives to him that hath and steals from him that hasnt but would mighty well like to have
He has no conscience no bowels no heart
But he has got tin and nerve and power to beat the band
In short and for all practical purposes for one in your profession Nancy Olden hes just God
Down on your knees and lick his bootsTrust gods wear boots patent leathersand thank him for permitting it you lucky baggage
I looked at the little man the angry red was just fading from the top of his cocoanutshaped bald head
You always were a fool Obermuller he said cordially
And you were always overfond of your lowcomedian jokes
If you hadnt been so smart with your tongue youd had more friends and not so many enemies in In the heavenly Syndicate eh
Well I have lived without You have lived but But where do I expect to go when I die
Good theatrical managers Nance when they die as individuals go to Heaventhey get into the Trust
After that they just touch buttons the Trust does the rest
Bad onesthe kickersthe Fred Obermullers go toa place where salaries cease from troubling and royalties are at rest
Its a slow place wherewhere in short theres nothing doing
And only one things donethe kicker
Its that place Mr Tausig thinks Im bound for
And its that place hes come to rescue you from from sheer goodness of heart and a wary eye for all theres in it
Cinch him Olden for all the traffic will bear
I looked from one to the otherObermuller big and savage underneath all his gay talk I knew him well enough to see that the little man his mouth turned down at the corners and a sneer in his eye for the fellow that wasnt clever enough to get in with the push
You must not give the young woman the big head Obermuller
Her own is big enough Ill bet as it is
I aint prepared to make any startling offer to a little girl thats just barely got her nose above the wall
The slightest shake might knock her off altogether or she mightnt have strength enough in herself to hold on
But well give her a chance
And because of what it may lead to if she works hard because of the opportunities we can give her there aint so much in it in a money way as you might imagine
Obermuller didnt say anything
His own lips and his own eyes sneered now and he winked openly at me which made the little man hot
Blast it
he twanged
I mean it
If youve got any notion through my coming down to your dirty little joint that weve set our hearts on having the girl just get busy thinking something else
She may be worth something to youmeasured up against the dubs youve got but to us To you its not so much your not having her as my having her that Exactly
It aint our policy to leave any doubtful cards in the enemys hands
He can have the bad ones
He couldnt get the good ones
And the doubtful ones like this girl Olden Well thats just where youre mistaken
Obermuller thrust his hands deep in his pockets and put out that square chin of his like the fighter he is 
This girl Olden is anything but doubtful
Shes a big card right now if she could be well handled
And the time isnt so far off when if you get her you people will be Just how much is your interest in her worth
the little man sneered
Obermuller glared at him and in the pause I murmured demurely Only a sixyear contract
Mag you should have seen em jumpboth of em the little man with vexation the big one with surprise
A contract
MeNance Olden
Why Mag you innocent of course I hadnt
Managers dont give sixyear contracts to girlburglars whove never set foot on the stage
When the little man was gone Obermuller cornered me
Whats your game Olden
he cried
Youre too deep for me I throw up my hands
Come whatve you got in that smart little head of yours
Are you holding out for higher stakes
Do you expect him to buy that great sixyear contract and divvy the proceeds with me
Because he willwhen once they get their eye on you theyll have you and to turn up your nose at their offer if in just the way to make them itch for you
But how the deuce did you find it out
And where do you get your nerve from anyway
A little beggar like you to refuse an offer from the T T and sit hatching your schemes on your little old steen dollars a week



Itll have to be twice steen now I suppose
All right just as you say I laughed
But why arent you in the Trust Fred Obermuller
Why arent you in society Nance
Umwell because societys prejudiced against lifting but the Trust isnt
Do you know thats a great graft Mr Obermullerlifting wholesale
Why dont you get in
Because a Trust is a lot of sailors on a raft who keep their places by kicking off the drowning hands that clutch at it
Can you fancy a fellow like Tausig stooping down to help me tenderly on board to divide the pickings
No but I can fancy you grappling with him till hed be glad to take you on rather than be pulled off himself
Youd be in with the push would you Olden if you were managing
he asked with a grin
Id be at the top wherever that was
Then why the deuce didnt you jump at Tausigs offer
Were you really crafty enough I am artiste Monsieur Obermuller I gutturaled like Mademoiselle Picotte who dances on the wire
I moost have about me those who arrewho arre congeniale You monkey
he laughed
Then when Tausig comes to buy your contract Well tell him to go to thunder
He laughed
Say Mag that big fellow is like a boy when hes pleased
I guess thats what makes it such fun to please him
And I who admired your business sagacity in holding off Nance
he said
I thought you admired my takeoff
of Mademoiselle Picotte
Well
Well why dont you make use of it
Take me round to the theaters and let me mimic all the swell actors and actresses
Ive got more chance with you than with that Trust gang
They wouldnt give me room to do my own stunt theyd make me fit into theirs
But you But me
You think you can wind me round your finger
Notyet
He chuckled
I thought I had him going
I saw Nance Olden spending her evenings at the big Broadway theaters when just at that minute Ginger the callboy burst in with a note
Say Mag I wouldnt like to get that man Obermuller hopping mad at me and Nancy Oldens no coward either
But the way he gritted his teeth at that note and the devil in his eyes when he lifted them from it made me wonder how Id ever dared be facetious with him
I got up to go
Hed forgotten me but he looked up then
That was a great suggestion of yours Olden to put Lord Gray on to act himselfgreat
His voice shook he was so angry
Well
I snapped
I wasnt going to let him see that a big man raging could bluff Nance Olden
What did he mean
Whyjust this there was Lord Harold Gray the real Lord behind the scenes bringing the Lady who was really only a chorus girl to the show in his automobile helping her dress like a maid holding her box of jewels as he tagged after her like a big Newfoundland smoking his one cigarette solemnly and admiringly while she was on the stage poking after her like a tame bear
Hes a funny fellow that Lord Harold
Hes a Tom Dorgan with the brains and the graft andand the brute too Mag washed out of him a Tom Dorgan thats been kept dressed in swagger clothes all his life and living at topnotcha big clean handsome stupid goodnatured overgrown boy
Yes Im coming to it
When Id seen him go tagging after her chippy Ladyship behind the scenes long enough I told Obermuller one day that it was absurd to send the mock Lady out on the boards and keep the live Lord hidden behind
He jumped at the idea and they rigged up a little act for the twothe Lord and the Lady
Gray was furious when she heard of ittheir making use of her Lord in such a waybut Lord Harold just swallowed his big Adams apple with a gulp or two and said Pon honor its a blawsted scheme you know but Im jolly sure Id make a bleddy ass of myself
I cawnt act you know
The ninny
You know he thinks Gray really can
But Obermuller explained to him that he neednt actjust be himself out behind the wings and lo
Lord Harold was chawmed
And Gray
Why she gave in at last pretended to anywaysliding out of the Charity sketch and rehearsing the thing with him and all that
Andand do you know what she did Mag
Nance Olden may be pretty mean but she wouldnt do a trick like that
She waited till ten minutes before time for the thing to be put on and then threw a fit
Shes so ill her delicate Ladyship
So ill she just cant go on this evening
Wonder how long she thinks such an excuse will keep Lord Harold off when I want him on
growled Obermuller throwing her note over to me
Hed have liked to throw it at me if itd been heavy enough to hurt he was so thumping mad
You see there it was on the program THE CLEVER SKETCH ENTITLED THEATRICAL ARISTOCRACY
The Duke of Portmanteau 



Lord Harold Gray
The Duchess 













Lady Gray
The celebrated Gray jewels including the great Rose Diamond will be worn by Lady Gray in this number
          No wonder Obermuller was raging
I looked at him
You dont like to tackle a fellow like that when hes dancing hot
And yet you ache to help him andyes yourself
Lord Harolds here yet and the jewels
I asked
He gave a short nod
He was thinking
But so was I
Then all he wants is a Lady
Thats all he said sarcastically
Well whats the matter with me
He gasped
Theres nothing the matter with your nerve Olden
Thank you so much
It was the way Gray says it when she tries to have an English accent
Dress me up Fred Obermuller in Grays new silk gown and the Gray jewels and youd never Id never set eyes on you again
Youd never know if you were in the audience that it wasnt Gray herself
I can take her off to the life and if the prompterll stand by He looked at me for a full minute
Try it Olden he said
I did
I flew to Grays dressingroom
Shed gone home deathly ill of course
They gave me the best seamstress in the place
She let out the waist a bit and pulled over the lace to cover it
I got into that mass of silk and laceoh silk on silk and Nance Olden inside
Beryl Blackburn did my hair and Grace Weston put on my slippers
Topham himself hung me with those gorgeous shining diamonds and pearls and emeralds till I felt like an idol loaded with booty
There were so many standing round me rigging me up that I didnt get a glimpse of the mirror till the second before Ginger called me
But in that secondin that second Mag Monahan I saw a fairy with blazing cheeks and shining eyes with a diamond coronet in her brown hair puffed high and pearls on her bare neck and arms and emeralds over the waist and rubies and pearls on her fingers and sprays of diamonds like frost on the lace of her skirt and diamond buckles on her very slippers and the rose diamond like a sun outshining all the rest andand Mag it was me
How did it go
Well wouldnt it make you think you were a Lady sure enough if you couldnt move without that lace train billowing after you without being dazzled with diamondshine without a truly Lord tagging after you
He kept his head Lord Harold dideven if it is a muttonhead
That helped me at first
He was so cold so stupid so slow so goodtemperedso just himself
And after the first plunge I tell you Mag Monahan theres one thing thats stronger than wine to a womanits being beautiful
Oh
And I was beautiful
I knew it before I got that quick hush with the full applause after it
And because I was beautiful I got saucy and then calm and then I caught Fred Obermullers voicehe had taken the book from the prompter and stood there himselfand after that it was easy sailing
He was there yet when the act was over and I trailed out followed by my Lord
He let the promptbook fall from his hands and reached them both out to me
I flirted my jeweled fan at him and swept him a courtesy
Cool
No I wasnt
Not a bit of it
He was daffy with the sight of me in all that glory and I knew it
Nance he whispered you wonderful girl if I didnt know about that little thief up at the Bronsonia IdId marry you alive just for the fun of piling pretty things on you
The deuce you would
I sailed past him with Topham and my Lord in my wake
They didnt leave me till theyd stripped me clean
I felt like a Christmas tree the day after
But somehow I didnt care
VIII
Is that you Mag
Well its about time you came home to look after me
Fine chaperon you make Miss Monahan
Why didnt I tell you the very day we took this flat what a chaperon was and that youd have to be mine
Imagine Nancy Olden without a chaperonShocking
No tisnt late
Sit down Maggie there and let me get the stool and talk to you
Think of us twoCruelty girls both of ustwo mangy kittens deserted by the old cats in a citys alleys and left mewing with cold and hunger and dirt out in the wetthink of us two in our own flat Mag
I say it makes me proud of us
There are times when I look at every stick of furniture we own and I try to pretend to it all that Im used to a decent roof over my head and a diningroom kitchen parlor bedroom and bath
Oh and I forgot the telephone the other tenant left here till its lease is up
But at other times I stand here in the middle of it and cry out to it in my heart Look at me Nancy Olden a householder a rentpayer the head of the family even if its only a family of two and the other one Mag
Look at me with my name in the directory apaying milk bills and meat bills and bread bills
Look at me with a place of my own where nobodys rights greater than my own where no one has a right but me and Mag a place wherewhere theres nothing to hide from the police
Theres the rub Mag as Hamlet saysI went to see it the other night so that I could take off the Opheliashe used to be a good mimic herself before she tried to be a leading lady
It spoils you this sense of safeness that goes with the honesty graft
You lose the quickness of the hunter and the nerve of the hunted
Andworseyou lose your taste for the old risky life
You grow proud and fat and you love every stick in the dear quiet little place thats your homeyour own home
You love it so that youd be ashamed to sneak round where it could see youyou whod always walked upright before it with the step of the mistress with nothing in the world to be ashamed of nothing to prevent your staring each honest dishpan in the face
1 And Mag you tryif youre meto fit Tom Dorgan in hereTom Dorgan in stripes and savage sulks stillall these monthskept away from the world even the world behind bars
Maggie dont you wish Tom was a ventriloquist oror an acrobat orbut this isnt what I had to tell you
Do you know what a society entertainer is Miss Monahan
No
Well look at me
Yes Im one
Miss Nance Olden whose services are worth fifty dollars a nightat least they were one night
Ginger brought me the note that made me a society entertainer
It was from a Mrs Paul B
Gates who had been charmed by your clever impersonations Miss Olden and write to know if you have the leisure to entertain some friends at my house on Thursday of this week
Had I the leisurewell rather
I showed the note to Gray just to make her jealous
Oh yes she goes on all right in the act with Lord Harold every night
Catch her letting me wear those things of hers twice
Well she just turned up her nose
Of course you wont accept
she said
Of course I will
Oh
I only thought youd feel as I should about appearing before a lot of snobs wholl treat you like a servant and Wholl do nothing of the sort and wholl pay you well for it put in Obermuller
He had come up and was reading the note I had handed to him
You just say yes Nance he went on after Gray had bounced of to her dressingroom
It isnt such a bad graft andand this is just between us two mindthat little beggar Tausig has begun his tricks since you turned his offer down
They can make things hot for me and if they do it wont be so bad for you to go in for this sort of thingunless you go over to the Trust I shook my head
Well this thing will be an ad for you besidesif the papers can be got to notice it
Theyre coy with their notices confound them since Tausig let them know that big Trust ads dont appear in the same papers that boom antiTrust shows
How long are you going to stand it Mr
O
Just as long as I cant help myself not a minute longer
There ought to be a waysome way Yes there ought but there isnt
Theyve got things down to a fine point and the fellow they dont fear has got to fear them



Ill put your number early tonight so that you can get off by nine
Good luck Nance
At nine then behold Nancy Olden in her white muslin dress longsleeved and highnecked and just to her shoetops with a big white muslin sash around her waist
Oh shes no baby is Nance but she looks like one in this rig with her short hairor rather like a schoolgirl which makes the stunts she does in mimicking the corkers of the profession all the more surprising
Were just a little party said Mrs Paul Gates coming into the bedroom where I was taking of my wraps
And Im so glad you could come for my principal guest Mr Latimer is an invalid who used to love the theaters but hasnt been to one since his attack many years ago
I count on your giving him in a way a condensed history in action of what is going on on the stage
I told her I would
But I didnt just know what I was saying
Think of Latimer there Maggie and think of our last meeting
It made me tremble
Not that I fancied for a moment hed betray me
The man that helps you twice dont hurt you the third time
No it wasnt that it was only that I longed to do wellwell before him so that And then I found myself in an alcove off the parlors separated from them by heavy curtains
It was such a pretty little red bower
Right behind me was the red of the Turkish drapery of a cozy corner and just as I took my place under the great chandelier the servants pulled the curtains apart and the lights went out in the parlors
In that minute I got it Magyes stage fright
Got it bad
I suppose it was coming to me but Lordy
I hadnt ever known before what it was
I could see the black of the mens clothes in the long parlors in front of me and the white of the womens necks and arms
There were soft ends of talk trailing after the first silence and everything was so strange that I seemed to hear two mens voices which sounded familiarLatimers silken voice and another a heavy coarse bass that was the last to be quieted
I fancied that when that last voice should stop I could begin but all at once my mind seemed to turn a somersault and instead of looking out upon them I seemed to be looking in on myselfto see a whitefaced little girl in a white dress standing alone under a blaze of light in a glare of red gazing fearfully at this queer new audience
Fail
Me
Not Nancy Maggie
I just took me by the shoulders
Nancy Olden you little thief
I cried to me inside of me
How dare you
Id rather youd steal the silver on this womans dressingtable than cheat her out of what she expects and whats coming to her
Nance really didnt dare
So she began
The first one was bad
I gave em Duses Francesca
Youve never heard the wailing music in that womans voice when she says There is no escape Smaragdi
You have said it The shadow is a glass to me and God Lets me be lost
I gave them Duse just to show them how swell I was myself which shows what a ninny I was
The thing the world loves is the opposite of what it is
The patpatpat of their gloves came in to me when I got through
They were too polite to hiss
But it wasnt necessary
I was hissing myself
Inside of me there was a long nasty hissssss
I couldnt bear it
I couldnt bear to be a failure with Latimer listening though out there in that queer halflight I couldnt see him at all but could only make out the couch where I knew he must be lying
I just jumped into something else to retrieve myself
I can do Carters Du Barry to the Queens taste Maggie
That rotten voice of hers like Mother Doutys but stronger and surer that rocky old face pretending to look young and beautiful inside that talented red hair of hers that whining Denny
Denny
she squawks out every other minute
Oh I can do Du Barry all right
They thought I could too those black and white shadows out there on the other side of the velvet curtains
But I cared less for what they thought than for the fact that I had drowned that sputtering hissssss inside of me and that Latimer was among them
I gave them Warfield then I was always good at taking off the sheenies in the alley behind the Crueltyremember
I gave them that little pinchnosed Maude Adams and dry corking little Mrs Fiske and Henry Miller when he smooths down his white breeches lovingly and sings Sally in our Alley and strutting old Mansfield and Say isnt it funny Mag that Ive seen em all and know all they can do
Theyve been my college education that crowd
Not a bad one either when you come to think of what I wanted from it
They pulled the curtains down at the end and I went back to the bedroom
I had my hat and jacket on when Mrs Gates and some of the younger ladies came to see me there but I caught no glimpse of Latimer
Youd thinkwouldnt youthat hed have made an opportunity to say just one nice word to me in that easy soft voice of his
I tried to believe that perhaps he hadnt really seen me lying down as he must have been or that he hadnt recognized me but I knew that I couldnt make myself believe that and the lack of just that word from him spoiled all my satisfaction with myself and I walked out with Mrs Gates through the hall and past the diningroom feeling as hurt as though Id deserved that a man like Latimer should notice me
The diningroom was all lighted but emptythe colored shaded candlesticks glowing down on the cut glass and silver on delicate china and flowers
The ladies and gentlemen hadnt come out to supper yet at least only one was there
He was standing with his back to me before the sideboard pouring out a glass of something from a decanter
He turned at the rustle of my starched skirt and as I passed the door he saw me
I saw him too and hurried away
Yes I knew him
Just you wait
I got home here earlier than Id expected and Id just got off my hat and jacket and put away that snug little check when there came a ring at the bell
I thought it was you Magthat youd forgotten your key
I was so sure of it that I pulled the door open wide with a flourish and And admittedEdward
Yes Edward husband of the Dowager
The same redfaced bignecked old fellow huskyvoiced with whisky now just as he was before
He must have been keeping it up steadily ever since the day out in the country when Tom lifted his watch
Itll take more than one lost watch to cure Edward
Ifollowed you home Miss Murieson he said grabbing me by the hand and pushing the door closed behind him
Or is it Miss Murieson
Which is your stage name and which your real one
And have you really learned to remember it
For my part any old name will smell as sweet now that Im close to the rose
I jerked my hand away from him
I didnt ask you to call I said haughty as the Dowager herself was when first I saw her in her gorgeous parlor the Bishops card in her hand
No I noticed that he roared jovially
You skinned out the front door the moment you saw me
All that was left to me was to skin after
Why
Why
He slapped his leg as though hed heard the best joke in the world
To renew our acquaintance of course
To ask you if you wouldnt like me to buy you a red coat and hat like the one you left behind you that day over in Philadelphia when you cut your visit so short
To insist upon my privilege of relationship
To call that wink you gave me in the hall that day you little devil
Now dont look at me like that
I say lets be friends wont you
Not for a red coat trimmed with chinchilla I cried
He got between me and the door
Prices gone up
he inquired pleasantly
Whos bulling the stock
Never you mind so long as his name isnt Ramsay
But why shouldnt his name be Ramsay
he cooed
Just because it isnt
Im expecting a friend
Hadnt you better go home to Mrs Dowager Diamonds
Bully
Is that what you call her
No Ill stay and meet your friend
Better not
Oh Im not afraid
Does he know as much about you as I do
More
About your weakness for other girls coats
Yes
You do know it all dont you
And yet you care for me Maggie Monahan
I retreated before him into the diningroom
What in the world to do to get rid of him
I think youd better go home Mr Ramsay I said again decidedly
If you dont Ill have to call the janitor to put you out
Call sweetheart
Hell put you out with me for Ill tell him a thing or two about you and well go and find a better place than this
Stock cant be quoted so high after all if this is the best prospectus your friend can put up



Why dont you call
I looked at him
I was thinking
Well
he demanded
Ive changed my mind
Oh Mag Mag did you ever see the manugly as a cannibal he may be and old as the cannibals greatgrandfatherthat couldnt be persuaded he was a ladykiller
His manner changed altogether
He plumped down on the lounge and patted the place beside him invitingly giving me a wink that was deadly
But Mrs
Dowager
I exclaimed coquettishly
Oh thats all right little one
She hasnt even missed me yet
When shes playing Bridge she forgets even to be jealous
Playing Bridge I murmured sweetly way off in Philadelphia while you you naughty man Oh he loved that
Not so naughty asas Id like to be he belllowed heavily witty
And she isnt way off in Philadelphia either
Shes just round the corner at Mrs Gates andwhats the matter
Nothingnothing
Did she recognize me
Oh thats what scared you is it
She didnt recognize you
Neither did I till I got that second glimpse of you with your hat and jacket on
But even if she hadho
ho
ho
I say do you know you couldnt convince the Bishop and Henrietta if youd talk till doomsday that that red coat and hat we advertised werent taken by a little girl that was daffy
Fact I swear it
They admit you took the coat you little witch but it was when you were out of your mindof courseof course
The very fact that she left the coat behind her and took nothing else from the house shows a mind diseased insisted Henrietta
Of courseof course
And her coming for no reason at all to your house adds the Bishop



Say what was the reason
Maggie Ill tell you a hard thing it isnt when people think worse of you than you are but better that you feel most uncomfortable
I got pale and sick inside of me at the thought of my poor little Bishop
I loved him for believing me straight and Ive been dying of curiosity to know what was in your wise little head that day he went on
Oh it was wise all right that wink you gave me was perfectly sane there was method in that madness of yours
I will tell you Mr Ramsay I said sweetly at supper
Supper
Yes the supper youre going to get for me
His bellowing laughter filled the place
Maggie our little flat and our few things dont go well with sounds like that
Oh youre all alike you women
he roared
All right supper it is
Where shall we goRectors
I pouted
Its so much more cozy right here I said
Ill telephone
Theres Brophys just round the corner and they send in the loveliest things
Oh they do
Well tell em to begin sending
I thought hed follow me out in the hall to the phone but he was having some trouble in pulling out his purseto count out his money I suppose
I got Central and asked for the number
Oh yes I knew it all right I had called up that same number once already today
Brophys
Why Maggie Monahan you ought to know theres no Brophys
At least none that I ever heard about
With my hand over the mouthpiece so that nobody heard but Edward I ordered a supper fit for a kingor a chorus girl
What didnt I order
Champagne broiled lobster crab meat stuffed pimentoes kirschkaffeeeverything Id ever heard Beryl Blackburn tell about
Say say interrupted Edward coming out after me
Thats enough of that stuff
Tell him to send in a Scotch and soda andwhat For at that moment the connection was made and I cut in sweetly with Mrs Edward Ramsayjust a minute
Mag you should have seen the mans face
It was red it was white it was furious it was frightened
I put my hand a moment over the mouthpiece and turned on him then
Ive got her on the phone at Mrs Gates house
Shall I tell your wife where you are Edward



Just a moment Mrs Ramsay hold the wire some one wants to speak with you
You little devil
His voice was thick with rage
Yes you called me that some time ago but not in that tone
Quick nowthe door or 


Waiting Mrs
Ramsay
He moved toward the door
Howll I know you wont tell her when Im gone
he growled
Merely by my saying that I wont I answered curtly
Youre in no position to dictate terms I am
But I could without leaving the phone latch the chain on the door behind him leaving it half open
So he must have heard the rest
Yes Mrs Ramsay waiting
I croaked like the driest kind of hellogirl
I was mistaken
It was a message left to be delivered to younot some one wanting to speak with you
Who am I
Why this is Central
Here is the message Will be with you in half an hour
Signed Edward



Yes thats right
Thank you
Good night
I hung up gave the door a touch that shut it in his face and went back into the diningroom to throw open the windows
The place smelled of alcohol the moral atmosphere left behind by that bad old man sickened me
I leaned out and looked at the stars and tried to think of something sweet and wholesome and strengthening
Ah Nance I cried to myself with a sobI had pretended to take it lightly enough when he was here but nowif you had heard of a girl who like yourself this evening unexpectedly met two men she had known and the good man ignored her and the bad one followed heroh Nancywhat sort of girl would you think she was at heart
What sort of hope could you imagine her treasuring for her own future
And what sort of significance would you attach to And just then the bell rang again
This time I was sure it was you
And O Maggie I ran to the door eager for the touch of your hand and the look in your eyes
I was afraid to be alone with my own thoughts
I was afraid of the conclusion to which they were leading me
Maggie if ever a girl needed comfort and encouragement and heartening I did then
And I got it dear
For there was a man at the door with a great basket of azaleaspale pink earthstars they are the sweet innocent thingsand a letter for me
Here it is
Let me read it to you
My dear Miss Omar Once on a time there was a Luckless Pot marred in the making that had the luck to be of service to a Pipkin
It was a saucy Pipkin though a very winning one and it had all the health and strength the poor Pot lackedphysically
Morallymorally that young Pipkin was in a most unwholesome condition
Already its fair smooth surface was scratched and fouled
It was unmindful of the treasure of good it contained and its responsibility to keep that good intact
And it seemed destined to crash itself to pieces among pots of baser metal
What the Luckless Pot did was littlebeing ignorant of the art by which diamonds may be attained easily and honestlybut it gave the little Pipkin a chance
What the Pipkin did with that chance the Pot learned tonight with such pleasure and satisfaction as made it impossible for him not to share it with her
So while he sent Burnett out to the conservatory to cut azaleas he wrote her a note to try to convey to her what he felt when in that nicely polished neatly decorated and selfrespecting Vessel on exhibition in Mrs Gates red room he recognized the poor little Pipkin of other days
The Pot as you know was a sort of stranded bit of clay that had never filled the use for which pots are created
He had little human to interest him
The fate of the Pipkin therefore he had often pondered on and in spite of improbabilities had had faith in a certain quality of brave sincerity the little thing showed a quality that shone through acquired faults like a star in a murky sky
This justification of his faith in the Pipkin may seem a small matter to make so much of
And yet the Potthat sleeps not well o nights as is the case with damaged potswill take to bed with him tonight a pretty pleasant thought due just to this
But do not think the Pot an idealist
If he were he might have been tempted to mistake the Pipkin for a statelier more pretentious Vessela Vase say all graceful curves and embossed sides but shallow perhaps possibly lacking breadth
No the Pipkin is a pipkin made of common clayeven though it has the uncommon sweetness and strength to overcome the tendencies of clayand fashioned for those common uses of life deprivation of which to anything that comes from the Potters hands is the most enduring the most uncommon sorrow
O pretty little Pipkin thank the Potter who made you as you are as you will bea thing that can cheer and stay mens souls by ministering to the human needs of them
For you be sure the Potters a good fellow and twill all be well
For the Pothe sails shortly or rather he is to be carted abroad by some optimistic friends whose hopes he does not shareto a celebrated repair shop for damaged pots
Whether he shall return patched and mended into temporary semblance of a useful Vessel whether he shall continue to be merely the same old Luckless Pot or whether he shall return at all O Pipkin does not matter much
But it has been well that before we two behind the veil had passed we met again and you left me such a fragrant memory
LATIMER
          O Maggie Maggie some day I hope to see that man and tell him how sorely the Pipkin needed the Pots letter
IX
Its all come so quick Maggie and it was over so soon that I hardly remember the beginning
Nobody on earth could have expected it less than I when I came off in the afternoon
I dont know what I was thinking of as I came into my dressingroom that used to be Graysthe sight of him seemed to cut me off from myself as with a knifebut it wasnt of him
It may have been that I was chuckling to myself at the thought of Nancy Olden with a dressingroom all to herself
I cant ever quite get used to that you know though I sail around there with all the airs of the leading lady
Sometimes I see a twinkle in Fred Obermullers eye when I catch him watching me and goodness knows hes been glum enough of late but it wasnt Yes Im going to tell you butits rattled me a bit Maggie
Im soso sorry and a littleoh just a little little bit glad
Id slammed the door behind methe old place is out of repair and the door wont shut except with a bangand I had just squatted down on the floor to unbutton my high shoes when I noticed the chintz curtains in front of the high dressingbox waver
They must have moved just like that when I was behind them monthsit seems yearsago
But you see Topham had never served an apprenticeship behind curtains so he didnt suspect
Lordy Nancy I laughed to myself some one thinks youve got a rose diamond and nd at that moment he parted the curtains and came out
YesTomTom Dorgan
My heart came beating up to my throat and then just as I thought I should choke it slid down to my boots sickening me
I didnt say a word
I sat there my foot in my lap staring at him
Oh Maggiegirl it isnt good to get your first glimpse after all these months of the man you love crouched like a big bull in a small space poking his closecropped black head out like a turtle thats not sure something wont be thrown at it and then dragging his big bulk out and standing over you
He used to be trimTomand taut but in those shapeless things the old trousers the dirty white shirt and the vest too big for him Well he said why dont you say something
Toms voiceMag do you remember the merry Irish boys voice with its chuckles like a brook gurgling as it runs
Notisnt the same voice
Itsits changed Maggie
Its heavy andand coarseandbrutal
Thats what it is
It sounds likelike the knout like Nancewhat in hells I think Imfrightened Tom
Oh the ladyfied airs of her
Aint you going to faint Miss Olden
I got up
Nono
Sit down Tom
Tell me about it
Howhow did you get here
He went to the door opened it a bit and looked out cautiously
MagMagit hurt methat
Why do you suppose
Youre sure nobodyll come in
he asked
I turned the key in the lock forgetting that it didnt really lock
Oh yes Im sure I said
Why
Why
You have got slow
Just because I didnt say goodby to them fellows up at the Pen and Oh
Youve escaped
Thats what
First jailbreak in fifteen years
What dye think of your Tommy old girl eh
Aint he the gamest
Aint you proud of him
My God Mag
Proud of him
He didnt knowhe couldnt seehimself
He shut in like a wild beast couldnt see what this year has done for him
Oh the changethe change in him
My boy Tommy with the gay gallus manner and the pretty jolly brogue and the laughing mouth under his brown mustache
And this manhis face is old Mag oldohand hardandand tough cheap and tough
Theres something in his eyes now and about his shaven mouthoh Maggie Maggie
Look here Nance
He caught me by the shoulders knocking up my chin so that he could look down squarely at me
Whats your graft
Whats it to be between us
Whatve ye been doing all this time
Out with it
I want to know
I shook myself free and faced him
Ive beenTom Dorgan Ive been to hear the greatest actors and actresses in the world say and do the finest things in the world
Ive watched princesses and kingseven if theyre only stage ones
Ive read a new book every nighta great picture book in which the pictures move and speakthats the stage Tom Dorgan
Much of it wasnt true but a girl whos been brought up by the Cruelty doesnt have to be told whats true and whats false
Ive met these people and lived with themas one does who thinks the same thoughts and feels what others feel
I know the world now Tom Dorgan the real world of men and womennot the little world of crooks nor yet the littler one of fairy stories
Ive got a glimpse too of that other world where all the scheming and lying and cheating is changed as if by magic into something that deceives all right but doesnt hurt
Its the world of art and artists Tom Dorgan where people paint their lies or write them or act them where they lift money all right from mens pockets but lift their souls and their lives too away from the things that trouble and bore andand degrade
You neednt sneer its made a different Nance out of me Tom Dorgan
And oh but Im sorry for the pert little beggar we both knew that lied and stole and hid and ran and skulked
She was like a poor little ignorant traveler in a great country where shed sized up the world from the few fool crooks she was thrown in with
She Aw cut it
Tomdoesdoesnt it mean anything to you
Cant it mean lots to both of us now that Cut it I tell you
Think I killed one guard and beat the other till Id broke every bone in his body to come here and listen to such guff
Youve been having a high old time eh and you never give a thought to me up there
I might a rotted in that black hole for all youd care you Dont
I did Tom I did
I was shivering at the name but I couldnt bear his thinking that way of me
I went up once but they wouldnt let me see you
I wrote you but they sent back the letters
Mag went up too but had to come back
And that time I brought you My voice trailed off
In that minute I saw myself on the way up to Sing Sing with the basket and all my hopes and all my schemes for amusing him
And this is what Id have seen if theyd let me inthis big gruff murdering beast
Oh yesyesbeast is what he is and it didnt make him look it less that he believed me andand began to think of me in a different way
I thought you wouldnt go back on a feller Nance
Thats why I come straight to you
It was my game to have you hide me for a day or two till you could make a strike somewhere and wed light out together
Howre ye fixed
Pretty smart eh
You look it my girl you lookMy eye Nance you look good enough to eat and Im hungry for you
Maggie if Id had to die for it I couldnt have moved then
Youd think a man would know when the woman hes holding in his arms is faintingsick at the touch of him
A woman would
It wasnt my Tom that Id known that Id worked with and played with andIt was a great brute whose mouthwho had no eyes no ears no senses butah



He laughed when I broke away from him at last
He laughed
And I knew then Id have to tell him straight in words
Tom I gasped you can have all Ive got and its plenty to get you out of the way
Butbut you cant havemeany more
Thatsdone
Oh the beast in his face
It must have looked like that when the guard got his last glimpse of it
Youre kiddin me
he growled
I shook my head
Then he ripped it out
Said the worst he could and ended with a curse
The blood boiled in me
The old Nance never stood that she used to sneer at other women who did
Get out of here
I cried
Gogo Tom Dorgan
Ill send every cent Ive got to you to Mother Doutys within two hours but dont you dare Dont YOU dare you shedevil
Just make up your mind to drop these newfangled airs and mighty quick
I tell you youll come with me cause I need you and I want you and I want you now
And Ill keep you when once I get you again
Well hang together
No more o this onesided layout for me where you get all the soft and its me for the hard
You belong to me
Yes you do
Just think back a bit Nance Olden and remember the kind of customer I am
If youve forgot just let me remind you that what I know would put you behind bars my lady and it shall I swear if Ive got to go to the Chair for it
Tom
It was Tom talking that way to me
I couldnt bear it
I made a rush for the door
He got there too and catching me by the shoulder he lifted his fist
But it never fell Mag
I think I could kill a man who struck me
But just as I shut my eyes and shivered away from him while I waited for the blow a knock came at the door and Fred Obermuller walked in
Eh
Oh
Excuse me
I didnt know there was anybody else
Nance your face is ghastly
Whats up
he said sharply
He looked from me to TomTom standing off there ready to spring on him to dart past him to fly out of the windowready for anything only waiting to know what the thing was to be
My senses came back to me then
The sight of Obermuller with those keen quick eyes behind his glasses his strong square chin and the whole poise of his head and body that makes men wait to hear what he has to say the knowledge that that man was my friend mineNancy Oldenslifted me out of the mud Id sunk back in and put my feet again on a level with his
Tom I said slowly Mr Obermuller is a friend of mine
Nolisten
What weve been talking about is settled
Dont bring it up again
It doesnt interest him and it cant change me I swear to you it cant nothing can
Im going to ask Mr Obermuller to help you without telling him just what the scrape is andand Im going to be sure that hell do it just because he Because youve taken up with him have you
Tom shouted savagely
Because shes your Tom
I cried
Tomoh yes now I remember
Obermuller got between us as he spoke
Your friend upin the country that you went to see and couldnt
Not a very goodlooker your friend Nance
Butfarming I suppose MrTomplays the deuce with ones looks
And another thing it does it makes a man forget sometimes just how to behave in town
Ill be charmed Mr Tom to oblige a friend of Miss Oldens but I must insist that he does not talk like afarmer
He was quite close to Tom when he finished and Tom was glaring up at him
And Mag I didnt know which one I was most afraid for
Dont you look at me that way Mag Monahan and dont you dare to guess anything
If you think growled Tom that Im going to let you get off with the girl youre mighty Now Ive told you not to say that
The reason Ill do the thing shes going to ask of meif its what I think it isis because this girls a plucky little creature with a soul big enough to lift her out of the muck you probably helped her into
Its because shes got brains talent and a heart
Its becausewell its because I feel like it and she deserves a friend
You dont know what she is
It was a snarl from Tom
You dont Oh yes I do you cur
I know what she was too
And I even know what she will be but that doesnt concern you
The hell it dont
Obermuller turned his back on him
I was dumb and still
Tom Dorgan had struck me after all
What is it you want me to do Nance
Obermuller asked
Get him away on a steamerquick I murmuredI couldnt look him in the facewithout asking why or what his name is
He turned to Tom
Well
I wont gonot without her
Because youre so fond of her eh
So fond your first thought on quitting thecountry was to come here to get her in trouble
If youve been traced Ah
You wouldnt like that eh
sneered Tom
Would you
Well Ive had my share of it
And she aint
StillI 


Just what would it be worth to you to have me out of the way
Oh TomTom I cried
But Obermuller got in front of me
It would be worth exactly one dollar and seventyfive cents
I think it will amount to about that for cabhire
I guess the cars arent any too safe for you or it might be less
It may amount to something more before I get you shipped before the mast on the first foreignbound boat
But whats more important he added bringing his fist down with a mighty thump on the table you have just ten seconds to make up your mind
At the end of that time Ill ring for the police
           I went down to the boat to see it sail Mag at seven this morning
No not to say goodby to him
He didnt know I was there
It was to say goodby to my old Tommy the one I loved
Truly I did love him Mag though he never cared for me
No he didnt
Men dont pull down the women they love I know that now
If Tom Dorgan had ever cared for me he wouldnt have made a thief of me
If hed cared the last place on earth hed have come to when he knew the detectives would be on his track would have been just the first place he made for
If hed cared he But its done Mag
Its all over
Cheapthats what he is this Tom Dorgan
Cheaply bada cheap bully cheapbrained
Remember my wishing hed have been a ventriloquist
Why that man that tried to sell me to Obermuller hasnt sense enough to be a good sceneshifter
Oh The firm of Dorgan  Olden is dissolved Mag
The retiring partner has gone into the theatrical business
As for Dorganthe real one poor fellow
jolly handsome big Tom Dorganhe died
Yes he died Maggie and was buried up there in the prison graveyard
A hard lot for a boy but its not the worst thing that can happen to him
He might become a man such a man as that fellow that sailed away before the mast this morning
X
There I was seated in a box all aloneMiss Nancy Olden by courtesy of the management come to listen to the leading lady sing coonsongs that I might add her to my collection of takeoffs
Shes a fat leading lady very fair and nearly fifty I guess
But shes got a rollicking husky voice in her fat throat thats sung the dollars down deep into her pockets
They say shes planted them deeper stillin the foundations of apartment housesand that now shes the richest rolypoly on the Rialto
Do you know Maggie darlin what I was saying to myself there in the box while I watched the stage and waited for Obermuller
He said hed drop in later perhaps
Nance I said I kind of fancy that apartment sort of idea myself
They tell you Nancy that when youve got the artistic temperament that thats all youll ever have
But theres a chanceone in a hundredfor a body to get that temperament mixed with a business instinct
It doesnt often happen
But when it does the result isdollars
It may be NanceI shrewdly suspect it is a fact that youve got that marvelous mixture
Your early successes Miss Olden in another profession that I neednt name would encourage the idea that youre not all heart and no head
I think Nance I shall have you mimic the artists during working hours and the business men when youre at play
I fancy apartment houses
They appeal to me
Well call one The Nancy and another Olden Hall and another 

 
Whatll I call the third apartment house Mr
O
I asked aloud as I heard the rings on the portiere behind me click
He didnt answer
Without turning my head I repeated the question
And yetsuddenlybefore he could have answered I knew something was wrong
I turned
And in that moment a man took the seat beside me and another stood facing me with his back against the portieres
Miss Olden
the man beside me asked
Yes
Nance Olden the mimic who entertains at private houses
I nodded
Youyou were at Mrs Paul Gates just a week ago and you gave your specialties there
Yesyes what is it you want
He was a little man but very muscular
I could note the play of his muscles even in the slight motion he made as he turned his body so as to get between me and the audience while he leaned toward me watching me intently with his small quick blue eyes
We dont want to make any scene here he said very low
We want to do it up as quietly as we can
There might be some mistake you know and then youd be sorry
So should we
I hope youll be reasonable and itll be all the better for you because What are you talkwhat I looked from him to the other fellow behind us
He leaned a bit farther forward then and pulling his coat partly open he showed me a detectives badge
And the other man quickly did the same
I sat back in my chair
The fat star on the stage with her big mouth and big babyface was doing a cakewalk up and down close to the footlights yelling the chorus of her song
Ill never mimic that song Mag although I can see her and hear it as plain as though Id listened and watched her all my life
But theres no fun in it for me
I hate the very bars the orchestra plays before she begins to sing
I cant bear even to think of the words
The whole of it is full of horrible thingsit smells of the jailit looks like stripesit 


Youre not going to faint
asked the man moving closer to me
Me
I never fainted in my life


Where is he nowTom Dorgan
Tom Dorgan
Yes
I was sure I saw him sail but of course I was mistaken
He has sent you after me has he
I can hardly believe it of Tomeveneven yet
I dont know anything that connects you with Dorgan
If he was in with you on this youd better remember before you say anything more that itll all be used against you
The curtain had gone down and gone up again
I was watching the star
She has such a boyish way of nodding her head instead of bowing after she waddles out to the center and every time she wipes her lips with her lace handkerchief as though shed just taken one of the cocktails she makes in the play with all the skill of a bartender
I found myself doing the same thingwiping my lips with that very same gesture as though I had a fat bare forearm like a rollingpinwhen all at once the thought came to me You neednt bother Nancy
Its all up
You wont have any use for it all
Just what is the charge
I asked turning to the man beside me
Stealing a purse containing three hundred dollars from Mrs Paul Gates house on the night of April twentyseventh
What
It was Obermuller
He had pushed the curtains aside the crashing of the orchestra had prevented our hearing the clatter of the rings
He had pushed by the man standing there had come in andhe had heard
Nance
he cried
I dont believe a word of it
He turned in his quick way to the men
What are your orders
To take her to her flat and search it
Obermuller came over to me then and took my hand for a minute
Its a pity they dont know about the Gray rose diamond he whispered helping me on with my jacket
Theyd see how silly this little threehundred dollar business is



Brace up Nance Olden
Oh Mag Mag to hear a man like that talk to you as though you were his kind when you have the feel of the coarse prison stripes between your dry shaking fingers and the close prison smell is already poisoning your nostrils
I dont see my voice shookhow you can believein me
Dont you
he laughed
Thats easy
Youve got brains Nance and the most imbecile thing you could do just now when your foot is already on the ladder would be just thisto get off in order to pick up a trinket out of the mud when theres a fortune up at the top waiting for you
Clever people dont do asinine things
And other clever people know that they dont
Youre clever but so am Iin my weak small way
Come along little girl
He pulled my hand in his arm and we walked out followed by the two men
Oh no
It was all very quiet and looked just like a little theater party that had an early supper engagement
Obermuller nodded to the manager out in the deserted lobby who stopped us and asked me what I thought of the star
Youll think me mad Mag
Those fellows with the badges were sure I was but Obermullers eyes only twinkled and the managers grin grew broad when catching up the end of my skirt and cakewalking up and down I sang under my breath that coonsong that was trailing over and over through my head
Bravo
bravo
whispered the manager hoarsely clapping his hands softly
I gave one of those quick funny boyish nods the star inside affects and wiped my lips with my handkerchief
That brought down my house
Even the biggest fellow with the badge giggled recognizingly and then put his hand quickly in front of his mouth and tried to look severe and official
The color had come back to Obermullers face it was worth dancing forthat
Be patient Mag let me tell it my way
There wasnt room in the coupe waiting out in front for more than two
So Obermuller couldnt come in it
But he put me inMag dear dear Maghe put me in as if I was a ladynot like Gray a real one
A thing like that counts when two detectives are watching
It counted afterward in the way they treated me
The big man climbed up on the seat with the driver
The blueeyed fellow got in and sat beside me closing the door
Ill be out there almost as soon as you are Obermuller said standing a moment beside the lowered window
You good fellow
I said and then trying to laugh Ill do as much for you some day
He shook his fist laughingly at me and I waved my hand as we drove of
You know Miss there may be some mistake about this said the man next to me and Yes there may be
In fact there is
Im sure Ill be very glad if it is a mistake
They do happenthough not often
You spoke of Dorgan Did I
Yes Tom Dorgan who busted out of Sing Sing the other day
Surely youre mistaken I said smiling right into his blue eyes
The Tom Dorgan I mentioned is a sleightofhand performer at the Vaudeville
Ever see him
Nno
Clever fellow
You ought to
Perhaps you dont recognize him under that name
On the bills hes Professor Haughwout
Stage people have so many names you know
Yes so havesome other people
I laughed and he grinned back at me
Now thats mean of you I said I never had but one
It was all I needed
It flashed through me then what a thing like this might do to a name
You know Mag every bit of recognition an actress steals from the world is so much capital
It isnt like the old graft when you had to begin new every time you took up a piece of work
And your namethe name the world knowsand its knowing it makes it worth having like everythingthat name is the sum of every scheme youve planned of every time youve got away with the goods of every laugh youve lifted of every bit of cleverness youve thought out and embodied of everything thats in you of everything you are
But I didnt dare think long of this
I turned to him
Tell me about this charge I said
Where was the purse
Whose was it
And why havent they missed it till after a week
They missed it all right that night but Mrs Gates wanted it kept quiet till the servants had been shadowed and it was positively proved that they hadnt got away with it
And then she thought of me
And then she thought of you
I wonder why
Because you were the only person in that room except Mrs Gates the lady who lost the purse Mrs Ramsay andeh
Nnothing
Mrs Ramsay you said
Yes
Not Mrs Edward Ramsay of Philadelphia
Oh you know the name
Oh yes I know it
It was printed you know in gold lettering on the inside flap and I dont know
Well it was and it contained three hundred dollars Mrs Ramsay says
She had slipped it under the fold of the spread at the top of the bed in the room where you took off your things in Mrs Gates presence and put them on again when no one else was there
And you mean to tell me that this is all
I raged at him that every bit of evidence you have to warrant your treating an innocent girl like You didnt behave like a very innocent girl if youll remember he said dryly when I first came into the box
In fact if that fellow hadnt just come in then I believe youd a confessed the whole job



Taint too late he added
I didnt answer
I put my head back against the cushions and closed my eyes
I could feel the scrutiny of his blue eyes on my naked faceyour face is so unprotected with the eyes closed like a fort whose battery is withdrawn
But I was tiredit tires you when you care
A year ago Mag this sort of thingthe risk the nearness to danger the chances one way or the otherwould have intoxicated me
I used to feel as though I was dancing on a volcano and daring it to explode
The more twistings and turnings there were to the labyrinth the greater glory it was to get out
Maggie darlin you have before you a mournful spectaclethe degeneration of Nancy Olden
It isnt that shes lost courage
Its only that she used to be able to think of only one thing and nowWhat do you suppose it is Mag
If you know dont you dare to tell me
When we got to the flat Obermuller was already there
At the door I pulled out my key and opened it with a flourish
Wont you come in gentlemen and spend the evening
I asked
They followed me in
First to the parlor
The two fellows threw off their coats and searched that through and throughnot a drawer did they miss not a bit of furniture did they fail to move
Obermuller and I sat there guying them as they pried about in their shirtsleeves
That Trust business has taken the life out of him of late
All their tricks all their squeezings their cheatings their bossing and bragging and bullying have got on to his nerves till he looks like a chained bear getting a drubbing
And he swears that theyre in a conspiracy to freeze him and a few others like him out he believes theres actually a paper in existence that would prove it
But this affair of the purse seemed to excite him till he behaved like a bad schoolboy
And I
Well Nance Olden was never far behind at the Cruelty when there was anything going on
We trailed after them and when theyd finished with the bedroomsyours and mineI asked the big fellow to come into the kitchen with Mr O and me while the blueeyed detective tackled the diningroom and Id get up a lunch for us all
Mag you should have seen Fred Obermuller with a big apron on him dressing the salad while I was making sandwiches
The Cruelty taught me how to cook even if it did teach me other things
You wouldnt have believed that the Trust had got him by the throat and was choking the last breath out of him
You wouldnt have believed that our salaries hadnt been paid for three weeks that our houses were dwindling every night that I was thinking about it all there in the back of my head trying to see a way out of ityou know if there is such an agreement as Obermuller swears there is its against the lawwhile we rattled on the two of us like a couple of children on a picnic when I heard a crash behind me
The salad bowl had slipped from Obermullers fingers
He stood with his back turned to me his eyes fixed upon that searching detective
But he wasnt searching any more Mag
He was standing still as a pointer thats scented game
He had moved the lounge out from the wall and there on the floor spread open where it had fallen lay a handsome elephantskin purse with gold corners
From where I stood Mag I could read the plain gold lettering on the dark leather
I didnt have to move
It was plain enoughquite plain
Mrs EDWARD RAMSAY Hush hush Mag if you take on so how can I tell you the rest
Obermuller got in front of me as I started to walk into the diningroom
I dont know what his idea was
I dont suppose he does exactlyif it wasnt to spare me the sight of that damned thing
Oh how I hated it that purse
I hated it as if it had been something alive that could be glad of what it had done
I wished it was alive that I could tear and rend it and stamp on it and throw it in a fire and drag it out again with burned and bleeding nails to tear it again and again
I wanted to fall on it and hide it to push it far far away out of sight to stamp it downdown into the very bottom of the earth where it could feel the hell it was making for me
But I only stood there stupidly looking at it having pushed past Obermuller as though I never wanted to see anything else
And then I heard that blueeyed fellows words
Well he said pulling on his coat as though hed done a good days work I guess youd just better come along with me
XI
Dont you think youd better get out of this
I asked Obermuller as he came into the station a few minutes after I got there
No
I do
Because
Because it wont do you any good to have your name mixed up with a thing like this
But it might do you some good
I didnt answer for a minute after that
I sat in my chair my eyes bent on the floor
I counted the cracks between the chair and the floor of the office where the Chief was busy with another case
I counted them six times back and forth till my eyes were clear and my voice was steady
Youre awfully good I said looking up at him as he stood by me
Youre the best fellow I ever knew
I didnt know men could be so good to women


But youd better goplease
Itll be bad enough when the papers get hold of this without having them lump you in with a bad lot like me
He put his hand on my shoulder and gave it a quick little shake
Dont say that about yourself
Youre not a bad lot
Butyou saw the purse
Yes I saw it
But it hasnt proved anything to me but this youre innocent Nance or youre crazy
If its the first I want to stand by you little girl
If its the secondgood God
Ive got to stand by you harder than ever
Can you see me sitting there Mag in the bright bare little room with its electric lights still in my white dress and big white hat my pretty jacket fallen on the floor beside me
I could feel the sharp blue eyes of that detective Morris feeding on my miserable face
But I could feel too a warmth like wine poured into me from that big fellows voice
I put my hand up to him and he took it
If Im innocent and can prove it Fred Obermuller Ill get even with you forfor this
Do you want to do something for me now
Do I
Well if you want to help me dont sit there looking like the criminal ghost of the girl I know
The blood rushed to my face
Nance Olden a sniveling coward
Me showing the white featherme whimpering like a whipped puppymeNance Olden
You know I smiled up at him I never did enjoy getting caught
Hush
But thats better



Tell me now A buzzer sounded
The blueeyed detective got up and came over to me
Chiefs ready he said
This way
They stopped Obermuller at the door
But he pushed past them
I want to say just a word to you Chief he said
You remember me
Im Obermuller of the Vaudeville
If youll send those fellows out and let me speak to you just a moment Ill leave you alone with Miss Olden
The Chief nodded to the blueeyed detective and he and the other fellow went out and shut the door behind them
I want simply to call your attention to the absurdity and unreasonableness of this thing Obermuller said leaning up against the Chiefs desk while he threw out his left hand with that big open gesture of his and to ask you to bear in mind no matter what appearances may be that Miss Olden is the most talented girl on the stage today that in a very short time she will be at the top that just now she is not suffering for lack of money that shes not a highroller but a determined hardworking little grind and that if she did feel like taking a plunge she knows that she could get all she wants from me even Even if you cant pay salaries when theyre due Obermuller
The Chief grinned under his white mustache
Even though the Trust is pushing me to the wall going to such lengths that theyre liable criminally as well as civilly if I could only get my hands on proof of their rascality
Its true I cant pay salaries always when theyre due but I can still raise a few hundred to help a friend
And Miss Olden is a friend of mine
If you can prove that she took this money you prove only that shes gone mad but you dont All right Obermuller
Youre not the lawyer for the defense
Thatll come laterif it does come
Ill be glad to bear in mind all youve said and much that you havent
Thank you
Good night



Ill wait for you Nance outside
Im going to ask you a lot of questions Miss Olden the old Chief said when we were alone
Sit here please
Morris tells me youve got more nerve than any woman thats ever come before me so I neednt bother to reassure you
You dont look like a girl thats easily frightened
I have heard how you danced in the lobby of the Manhattan how you guyed him at your flat and were getting lunch and having a regular picnic of a time when When he found that purse
Exactly
Now why did you do all that
Why
Because I felt like it
I felt gay and excited and Not dreaming that that purse was sure to be found
Not dreaming that there was such a purse in existence except from the detectives sayso and never fancying for an instant that it would be found in my flat
Hm
He looked at me from under his heavy wrinkled old lids
You dont get nice eyes from looking on the nasty things in this world Mag
Why I cried what kind of a girl could cut up like that when she was on the very edge of discovery
A very smart girlan actress a good one a clever thief whos used to bluffing
Of course he added softly you wont misunderstand me
Im simply suggesting the different kinds of girl that could have done what you did
But if you dont mind Ill do the questioning
Nance Olden he turned suddenly on me his manner changed and threatening what has become of that three hundred dollars
Mr Chief you know just as much about that as I do
I threw up my head and looked him full in the face
It was over nowall the shivering and trembling and fearing
Nance Oldens not a coward when shes fighting for her freedom and fighting alone without any sympathizing friend to weaken her
He returned the look with interest
I may know more he said insinuatingly
Possibly
I shrugged my shoulders
No it wasnt put on
There never yet was a man who bullied me that didnt rouse the fighter in me
I swore to myself that this old thiefcatcher shouldnt rattle me
Doesnt it occur to you that under the circumstances a full confession might be the very best thing for you
I shouldnt wonder if these people would be inclined to be lenient with you if youd return the money
Doesnt it occur It might occur to me if I had anything to confessabout this purse
How long since youve seen Mrs Edward Ramsay
He rushed the question at me
I jumped
How do you know Ive ever seen her
I do know you have
I dont believe you
Thank you neither do I believe you which is more to the point
Come answer the question how long is it since you have seen the lady
I looked at him
And then I looked at my glove and slowly pulled the fingers inside out and thenthen I giggled
Suddenly it came to methat silly little insane dodge of mine in the Bishops carriage that day the girl who had lost her name and the use all that affair might be to me if ever Ill tell you if youll let me think a minute I said sweetly
Itit must be all of fifteen months
Ah
You see I did know that youve met the lady
If youre wise youll draw deductions as to other things I know that you dont think I do



And where did you see her
In her own home
Called there he sneered alone
No I said very gently
I went there to the best of my recollection with the Bishopyes it was the Bishop Bishop Van Wagenen
Indeed
I could see that he didnt believe a word I was saying which made me happily eager to tell him more
Yes we drove up to the Square one afternoon in the Bishops carriagethe fat plumcolored one you know
We had tea thereat least I did
I was to have spent the night but Thats enough of that
I chuckled
Yes Mag Monahan I was enjoying myself
I was having a run for my money even if it was the last run I was to have
So its fifteen months since youve seen Mrs Ramsay eh
Yes
He turned on me with a roar
And yet its only a week since you saw her at Mrs
Gates
Oh no
No
Take care
That night at Mrs Gates it was dark you know in the front room
I didnt see Mrs Ramsay that night
I didnt know she was there at all till Till
Till later I was told
Who told you
Her husband
He threw down his pencil
Look here this is no lark young woman and you neednt trouble yourself to weave any more fairy tales
Mr Ramsay is in ahes very ill His own wife hasnt seen him since that night so you see youre lying uselessly
Really
So Edward didnt go back to Mrs Gates that night
Tut
tut
After his telephone message too
Now assuming your innocence of the theft Miss Olden what is your theory how do you account for the presence of that purse in your flat
Now youve hit the part of it that really puzzles me
How do you account for it what is your theory
He got to his feet pushing his chair back sharply
My theory if you want to know it is that you stole the purse that your friend Obermuller believes you did that you got away with the three hundred or hid it away and And what a stupid thief I must be then to leave the empty purse under my lounge
How do you know it was empty
he demanded sharply
You said so


Well you gave me to understand that it was then
What difference does it make
It would be a still stupider thief whod leave a full purse instead of an empty one under his own lounge
Yes and youre not stupid Miss Olden
Thank you
Im sorry I cant say as much for you
I couldnt help it
He was such a stupid
The idea of telling me that Fred Obermuller believed me guilty
The idea of thinking me such a fool as to believe that
Such men as that make criminals
Theyre so fatwitted you positively achethey so tempt you to pull the wool over their eyes
O Mag if the Lord had only made men cleverer thered be fewer Nancy Oldens
The Chief blew a blast at his speakingtube that made his purple cheeks seem about to burst
My shoulders shook as I watched him he was so wrathy
And I was still laughing when I followed the detective out into the waitingroom where Obermuller was pacing the floor
At the sight of my smiling face he came rushing to me
Nance
he cried
Orders are Morris came in a bellow from the Chief at his door that no further communication be allowed between the prisoner and Phew
All the pertness leaked out of me
Oh Mag I dont like that word
It stingsit bindsit cuts
I dont know what I looked like then I wasnt thinking of me
I was watching Obermullers face
It seemed to grow old and thin and haggard before my eyes as the blood drained out of it
He turned with an exclamation to the Chief and And just then there came a long ring at the telephone
Why did I stand there
O Mag when youre on your way to the place I was bound for when you know that before youll set foot in this same bright little room again the hounds in half a dozen cities will have scratched clean every hidingplace youve had when your every act will be known andandoh then you wait Mag you wait for anythinganything in the world even a telephone call that may only be bringing in another wretch like yourself bound like yourself for the Tombs
The Chief himself went to answer it
Yeswhat
he growled
Well tell Long Distance to get busy
Whats that
St Francisthats the jag ward isnt it
Who is it
Who
Ramsay
I caught Obermullers hand
I dont hear you the Chief roared
Ohyes
Yes weve got the thief but the moneyno we havent got the money
The deuce you say
Took it yourself
Out of your wifes purseyes



Yes
But weve got theWhat
Dont remember where you Steady Nance whispered Obermuller grabbing my other hand
I tried to stand steady but everything swayed and I couldnt hear the rest of what the Chief was saying though all my life seemed condensed into a listening
But I did hear when he jammed the receiver on the hook and faced us
Well theyve got the money
Ramsay took the purse himself thinking it wasnt safe there under the spread where any servant might be tempted who chanced to uncover it
Youll admit the thing looked shady
The reason Mrs Ramsay didnt know of it is because the old mans just come to his senses in a hospital and been notified that the purse was missing
I want to apologize to you Chief I mumbled
For thinking me stupid
Oh we were both No for thinking me not stupid
I am stupidstupidstupid
The old fellow I told you about Mr O and the way I telephoned him out of the flat that nightit was Ramsay
I nodded and then crumbled to the floor
It was then that they sent for you Mag
Why didnt I tell it straight at the first you dear old Mag
Because I didnt know the straight of it then myself
I was so heavywitted I never once thought of Edward
He must have taken the bills out of the purse and then crammed them in his pocket while he was waiting there on the lounge and I was pretending to telephone and But its best as it isoh so best
Think Mag
Two people who knew herwho knew her mindbelieved in Nancy Olden in spite of appearances Obermuller while we were in the thick of it and you you dear girl while I was telling you of it
XII
When Obermuller sent for me I thought he wanted to see me about that play hes writing in which Im to starwhen the pigs begin to fly
Funniest thing in the world about that man Mag
He knows he cant get bookings for any play on earth that if he did theyd be canceled and any old excuse thrown at him as soon as Tausig heard of it and could put on the screws
He knows that there isnt an unwatched hole in theatrical America through which he can crawl and pull me and the play in after him
And yet he just cant let go working on it
He loves it Mag he loves it as Molly loved that child of hers that kept her nursing it all the years of its life and left her feeling that the world had been robbed of everything there was for a woman to do when it died
Obermuller has told me all the plot
In fact hes worked it out on me
I know it as it is as he wanted it to be and as its going to be
He tells me hes built it up about me that it will fit me as never a comedy fitted a player yet and that well make such a hitthe play and I togetherthat 


And then he remembers that theres no chance not the ghost of one and he falls to swearing at the Trust
Dont you think Mr O I said as he began again when I came into his office that it might be as well to quit cursing the Syndicate till youve got something new to say or something different to rail about
It seems to me a mans likely to get daffy if he keeps harping on Oh Ive got it all right Nance be sure of that
Ive got something different to say of them and something new to swear about
Theyve done me up thats all
Just as theyve fixed Iringer and Gaffney and Howison
Tell me
He threw out his arms and then let them fall to his side
Oh its easy he cried so easy that I never thought of it
Theyve just bought the Vaudeville out of hand and served notice on me that when my lease expires next month theyll not be able to renew it unfortunately
Thats all
No not quite
In order to kill all hope of a new plan in me theyve just let it get to be understood that any man or woman that works for Obermuller neednt come round to them at any future time
Phew
A blacklist
Not anything so tangible
Its just a hint you know but it works all right
It works like What are you going to do what can you do
Shoot Tausig or myself or both of us
Nonsense
Yes of course its nonsense or rather its only what Id like to do



But thats not the question
Never mind about me
Its what are you going to do
He looked straight at me waiting
But I didnt answer
I was thinking
You dont realize Nance what those fellows are capable of
When Gaffney told me before he gave up and went West that there was a genuine signed conspiracy among them to crush out us independents I laughed at him
Its a dream Gaffney I said
Forget it
Its no dream as youll find out when your turn comes in time he shouted
Its a fact and whats more Iringer once taxed Tausig to his face with it told him he knew there was such a document in existence signed by the great Tausig himself by Heffelfinger of the Pacific circuit by Dixon of Chicago and Weinstock of New Orleans binding themselves to force us fellows to the wall and specifying the per cent
of profit each one of em should get on any increase of business to blacklist every man and woman that worked for us to buy up our debts and even bring false attachments when Now werent there enough real debts to satisfy em
Theyre hard to please if you havent creditors enough to suit em
He looked grim but he didnt speak
I dont believe it anyway Mr O and tisnt good for you to keep thinking about just one thing
Youll land where Iringer did if you dont look out
How did he know about it anyway
There was a leak in Tausigs office
Iringer used to be in with them and he had it from a clerk whobut never mind that
Its the blacklisting Im talking about now
Grays just been in to see me to let me know that she quits at the end of the season
And his Lordship too of course
Youre not burdened with a contract Nance
Perhaps youd better think it over seriously for a day or two and decide if it wouldnt be best I dont have to I interrupted then
Nance
he cried jumping up as though hed been relieved of half his troubles
I dont have to think it over I went on slowly not looking at the hand he held out to me
It doesnt take long to know that when youre between the devil and the deep sea youd better trythe devil rather than be forced out into the wet
Whatyou dont mean I knew he was looking at me incredulously but I just wouldnt meet his eye
My staying with you will do you no good was hurrying now to get it over withand it would do me a lot of harm
I think youre right Mr Obermuller Id better just go over to where its warm
Theyll be glad to get me andand to tell the truth Ill be glad to get in with the Syndicate even if I cant make as good terms as I might have by selling that contract whichlike the famous conspiracy youre half mad aboutnever existed
He sat down on the edge of the desk
I caught one glimpse of his face
It was black that was enough for me
I turned to go
Ah but it did Miss Olden it did
he sneered
I wont believe it on the word of a man thats been in the lunatic asylum ever since he lost his theater
Perhaps youll believe it on mine
I jumped
On yours
Didnt that little bully when he lost his temper that day at the Van Twiller when we had our last fightdidnt he pull a paper out of his box and shake it in my face and Butyou could have them arrested for conspiracy and And the proof of it could be destroyed and thenbut I cant see how this interests you
Nono I said thoughtfully
I only happened to lump it in with the contract we haventyou and I
And as theres no contract why theres no need of my waiting till the end of the season
Do you mean to say youdyoud If twere done twere better itd be donequickly I said Macbethically
He looked at me
Sitting there on his desk his clenched fist on his knee he looked for a moment as though he was about to fly at me
Then all of a sudden he slipped into his chair leaned back and laughed
It wasnt a pleasant laugh Mag
Nowait
Let me tell you the rest
You are so shrewd Olden so awfully shrewd
Your eye is so everlastingly out for the main chance and youre still so young that I predict aa great future for you
I might even suggest that by cultivating Tausig personally You neednt
No youre right I neednt
You can discount any suggestion I might make
You just want to be the first to go over eh
To get there before Gray doesto get all there is in it for the first rebel that lays down his arms not to come in late when submission is staleand cheap
Dont worry about terms you poor little babe in the woods
Dont His own words seemed to choke him
Dont you think I began a bit unsteadily
I thinkoh what a fool Ive been
That stiffened me
Of course you have I said cordially
Its silly to fight the push isnt it
Its only the cranks that get cocky and think they can upset the fellows on top
The thing to do is to find out which is the strongerif youre a better man than the other fellow down him
If hes the champion enlist under him
But be in it
Whats the use of being a kicker all your life
You only let some one else come in for the soft things while you stay outside and gnaw your fingernails and plot and plan and starve
You spend your life hoping to live tomorrow while the Tausigs are living high today
The thing to do is to be humble if you cant be arrogant
If theyve got you in the door dont curse but placate them
Think of Gaffney herding sheep out in Nevada of Iringer in the asylum of Howison Admirable
admirable
he interrupted sarcastically
The only fault I have to find with your harangue is that youve misconceived my meaning entirely
But I neednt enlighten you
Good morning Miss Oldengoodby
He turned to his desk and pulled out some papers
I knew he wasnt so desperately absorbed in them as he pretended to be
Wont you shake hands I asked and wish me luck
He put down his pen
His face was white and hard but as he looked at me it gradually softened
I supposeI suppose I am a bit unreasonable just this minute he said slowly
Im hard hit andand I dont just know the way out
Still I havent any right toto expect more of you than there is in you you poor little thing
Its not your fault but mine that Ive expectedOh for Gods sakeNancego and leave me alone
I had to take that with me to the Van Twiller and it wasnt pleasant
But Tausig received me with open arms
Got tired of staying out in the coldeh
he grinned
Im tired of vaudeville I answered
Cant you give me a chance in a comedy
Hm
Ambitious aint you
Obermuller has a play all ready for mewritten for me
Hed star me fast enough if he had the chance
But hell never get the chance
Oh I dont know
But I do
Hes on the toboggan thats where they all get my dear when they get bigheaded enough to fight us
But Obermullers not like the others
Hes not so easy
And he is so clever why the plot of that comedy is the bulliest thing Youve read ityou remember it
Oh I know it by heartmy part of it
You see he wouldnt keep away from me while he was thinking of it
He kept consulting me about everything in it
In a way we worked over it together
The little man looked at me slowly closing one eye
It is a habit of his when hes going to do something particularly nasty
Then in a way as you say it is part yours
Hardly
Imagine Nance Olden writing a line of a play
Still youcollaborated thats the word
I say my dear if I could read that comedy and it washalf what you say it is I mightI dont promise mindbut I might let you have the part that was written for you and put the thing on
Has he drilled you any eh
He was the best stagemanager we ever had before he got the notion of managing for himselfand ruining himself
Well hes all that yet
Of course he has told me and we agreed how the thing should be done
As hed write you know hed read the thing over to me and I Finefine
A reading from that fool Obermuller would be enough to open the eyes of a clever woman
Id like to read that comedyyes
But Obermuller would never But Olden might What
Dictate the plot to my secretary Mason in there he nodded his head back toward the inner room
She could give him the plot and as much of her own part in full as she could remember
You know Mason
Used to be a newspaper man
Smart fellow that when hes sober
He could piece out the holesyes
I looked at him
The little beast sat there slowly closing one eye and opening it again
He looked like an unhealthy little frog with his bald head his thinlipped mouth that laughed while the wrinkles rayed away from his cold sneering eyes that had no smile in them
II wouldnt like to make an enemy of a man like Obermuller Mr
Tausig
Bah
Aint I told you hes on the toboggan
But you never can tell with a man like that
Suppose he got into that combine with Heffelfinger and Dixon and Weinstock
Whatre you talking about
Well its what Ive heard
But Heffelfinger and Dixon and Weinstock are all in with us who told you that fairy story
Obermuller himself
The little fellow laughed
His is a creaky almost silent little laugh if a spider could laugh hed laugh that way
Theyre fooling him a bunch or two
Never you mind Obermuller
Hes a dead one
Oh he said that you thought they were in with you but that nothing but a written agreement would hold men like that
And that you hadnt got
Smart fellow that Obermuller
Hed have been a good man to have in the business if it hadnt been for those independent ideas hes got
Hes right it takes So there is an agreement
I shouted in spite of myself as I leaned forward
He sat back in his chair or rather he let it swallow him again
What business is that of yours
Stick to the business on hand
Get to work on that play with Mason inside
If its good and we decide to put it on well pay you five hundred dollars down in addition to your salary
If its rot youll have your salary weekly all the time youre at it just the same as if you were working till I can place you
In the meantime keep your ears and eyes open and watch things and your mouth shut
Ill speak to Mason and hell be ready for you tomorrow morning
Come round in the morning theres nobody about then and we want to keep this thing dark till its done
Obermuller mustnt get any idea what were up to



He dont love younofor shaking him
Hes furious wouldnt even say goodby
Im done for with him anyway I guess
But what could I do
Nothing my dear nothing
Youre a smart little girl he chuckled
Tata
XIII
Just what Id been hoping for I dont know but I knew that my chance had come that morning
For a week I had been talking Obermullers comedy to Mason the secretary
In the evenings I stood about in the wings and watched the Van Twiller company in Brambles
There was one fat role in it that I just ached for but I lost all that ache and found another when I overheard two of the women talking about Obermuller and me one night
He found her and made her one of em said just dug her out of the ground
See what hes done for her taught her every blessed thing she knows wrote her mimicking monologues for her gave her her chance andand nowWell Tausig dont pay salaries for nothing and she gets hers as regularly as I draw mine
What more I dont know
But she hasnt set foot on the stage yet under Tausig and they say Obermuller I didnt get the rest of it so I dont know what they say about Obermuller
I only know what theyve said to him about me
Tisnt hard to make men believe those things
But I had to stand it
What could I do
I couldnt tell Fred Obermuller that I was making over his play soul and as much body as I could remember to Tausigs secretary
Hed have found that harder to believe than the other thing
It hasnt been a very happy week for me I can tell you Maggie
But I forgot it all every shiver and ache of it when I came into the office that morning as usual and found Mason alone
Not altogether alonehe had his bottle
And he had had it and others of the same family all the night before
The poor drunken wretch hadnt been home at all
He was worse than hed been that morning three days before when I had stood facing him and talking to him while with my hands behind my back I was taking a wax impression of the lock of the desk and he as unconscious of it all as Tausig himself
The last page I had dictated the day before which hed been transcribing from his notes lay in front of him the gas was still burning directly above him and a shade he wore over his weak eyes had been knocked awry as his poor old bald head went bumping down on the typewriter before him
The thing that favored me was Tausigs distrust of everybody connected with him
He hates his partners only a bit less than he hates the men outside the Trust
The bigger and richer the Syndicate grows the more power and prosperity it has the more he begrudges them their share of it the more he wants it all for himself
He is madly suspicious of his clerks and hires others to watch them to spy upon them
He is continually moving his valuables from place to place partly because he trusts no man partly because hes so deathly afraid his right hand will find out what his left is doing
He is a full partner of Braun and Lowenthalwith mental reservations
He has no confidence in either of them
Half his schemes he keeps from them the other half he tells thempart of
Hes for ever afraid that the Syndicate of which hes the head will fall to pieces and become another Syndicate of which he wont be head
It all makes him an unhappy restless little beast but it helped me today
If itd been any question of safe combinations and tangled things like that the game would have been all up for Nancy O
But in his official safe Tausig keeps only such papers as he wants Braun and Lowenthal to see
And in his private desk in his private office he keeps I stole past Mason sleeping with his forehead on the typewriter keyshell be lettered like the obelisk when he wakes upand crept into the next room to see just what Tausig keeps in that private desk of his
Oh yes it was locked
But hadnt I been carrying the key to it every minute for the last fortyeight hours
There must be a mine of stuff in that desk of Tausigs Mag
The touch of every paper in it is slimy with some dirty trick some bad secret some mean action
Its a pity that I hadnt time to go through em all it would have been interesting but under a bundle of womens letters which that old fox keeps for no good reason Ill bet I lit on a paper that made my heart go bumping like a cart over cobbles
Yes there it was just as Obermuller had vowed it was with Tausigs cramped little signature followed by Heffelfingers Dixons and Weinstocks a scheme to crush the business life out of men by the cleverest uptodate Trust deviltry a thing that our Uncle Sammy just wont stand for
And neither will Nancy Olden Miss Monahan
She grabbed that precious paper with a gasp of delight and closed the desk
But she bungled a bit there for Mason lifted his head and blinked dazedly at her for a moment recognized her and shook his head
Nowork today he said
NoI know
Ill just look over what weve done Mr Mason she answered cheerfully
His poor head went down again with a bob and she caught up the typewritten sheets of Obermullers play
She waited a minute longer half because she wanted to make sure Mason was asleep again before she tore the sheets across and crammed them down into the wastebasket half because she pitied the old fellow and was sorry to take advantage of his condition
But she knew a cure for this last sorrya way shed help him later and when she danced out into the hall she was the very happiest burglar in a world chock full of opportunities
Oh she was in such a twitter as she did it
All that old delight in doing somebody else up a vague somebody whose meannesses she didnt know was as nothing to the joy of doing Tausig up
She was dancing on a volcano again that incorrigible Nance
Oh but such a volcano Maggie
It atoned for a year of days when there was nothing doing no excitement no risk nothing to keep a girl interested and alive
And Maggie darlin it was a wonderful volcano that ones that last one for it worked both ways
It paid up for what I havent done this past year and what Ill never do again in the years to come
It made up to me for all Ive missed and all Im going to miss
It was a reward of demerit for not being respectable and a preventive of further sins
Oh it was such a volcano as never was
It was a drink and a blue ribbon in one
It was a bangup end and a bully beginning
It was It was Tausig coming in as I was going out
Suddenly I realized that but I was in such a mad whirl of excitement that I almost ran over the little fellow before I could stop myself
Phew
What a whirlwind you are
he cried
Where are you going
Oh good morning Mr Tausig I said sweetly
I never dreamed youd be down so early in the morning
Whatre you doing with the paper
he demanded suspiciously
My eye followed his
I could have beaten Nancy Olden in that minute for not having sense enough to hide that precious agreement instead of carrying it rolled up in her hand
Just taking it home to go over it I said carelessly trying to pass him
But he barred my way
Wheres Mason
he asked
Poor Mason
I said
Heshes asleep
Drunk again
I nodded
How to get away
That settles his hash
Out he goes today 


It seems to me youre in a deuce of a hurry he added as I tried to get out again
Come in I want to talk something over with you
Not this morning I said saucily
I wanted to cry
Ive got an engagement to lunch and I want to go over this stuff for Mason before one
Hm
An engagement
Who with now
My chin shot up in the air
He laughed that cold noiseless little laugh of his
But suppose I want you to come to lunch with me
Oh thank you Mr Tausig
But how could I break my engagement with With Braun
How did you guess it
I laughed
Theres no keeping anything from you
He was immensely satisfied with his little self
I know himthat old rascal he said slowly
I say Olden just do break that engagement with Braun
I oughtntreally
But doeh
Finish your work here and well go off together us two at twelvethirty and leave him cooling his heels here when he comes
He rubbed his hands gleefully
But Im not dressed
Youll do for me
But not for me
Listen let me hurry home now and Ill throw Braun over and be back here to meet you at twelvethirty
He pursed up his thin little lips and shook his head
But I slipped past him in that minute and got out into the street
At twelvethirty I called back as I hurried off
I got around the corner in a jiffy
Oh I could hardly walk Mag
I wanted to fly and dance and skip
I wanted to kick up my heels as the children were doing in the Square while the organ ground out Aint It a Shame
I actually did a step or two with them to their delight and the first thing I knew I felt a bit of a hand in mine like a cool pink snowflake and Oh a baby Mag
A girlbaby more than a year old and less than two years young too little to talk too big not to walk facing the world with a winning smile and jabbering things in her soft little lingo knowing that every woman she meets will understand
I did all right
She was saying to me as she kicked out her soft heelless little boot Nancy Olden I choose you
Nancy Olden I love you
Nancy Olden I dare you not to love me
Nancy Olden I defy you not to laugh back at me
Where in the world she dropped from heaven knows
The organgrinder picked up the shafts of his wagon and trundled it away
The piccaninnies melted like magic
But that gay little flirt about a year and a half old just held on to my finger and gabbledpoetry
I didnt realize just then that she was a lost strayed or stolen
I expected every moment some nurse or conceited mamma to appear and drag her away from me
And I looked down at heroh she was just a little bunch of soft stuff her face was a giggling dimple framed in a big round hathalo that had fallen from her chickenblond head and her white dress with the blue ribbons at the shoulders was just a little bit dirty
I like em a little bit dirty
Why
Perhaps because I can imagine having a little coquette of my own a bit dirty like that and cant just see Nance Olden with a spickandspan clean baby all feathers and lace like a bored little grownup
Youre a mouse I gurgled down at her
Youre a sweetheart
Youre a And suddenly I heard a cry and rush behind me
It was a false alarm just a longlegged girl of twelve rushing round the corner followed by a lot of others
It hadnt been meant for me of course but in the second when I had remembered that precious paper and Tausigs rage when he should miss it I had pulled my hand away from that bit babys and started to run
The poor little tot
There isnt any reason in the world for the fancies they take any more than for our own eh Mag
Why should she have been attracted to me just because I was so undignified as to dance with the piccaninnies
But do you know what that little thing did
She thought I was playing with her
She gave a crow of delight and came bowling after me
That finished me
I stooped and picked her up in my arms throwing her up in the air to hear her crow and feel her come down again
Mouse I said well just have a little trip together
The nurse thatd lose you deserves to worry till youre found
The mother thats lucky enough to own you will be benefited hereafter by a sharp scare on your account just now
Come on sweetheart
Oh the feel of a baby in your arms Mag
It makes the Cruelty seem a perfectly unreal thing a thing one should be unutterably ashamed of imagining of accusing human nature of a thing only an irredeemably vile thing could imagine
Just the weight of that little body riding like a bonny boat at anchor on your arm just the cocky little way it sits up chirping and confident just the light touch of a bit of a hand on your collar just that is enough to push down brick walls to destroy pictures of bruised and maimed children that endure after the injuries are healed to scatter records that even II Nancy Oldencant believe and believe too that other women have carried their babies as I did some other womans baby across the Square
On the other side I set her down
I didnt want to
I was greedy of every moment that I had her
But I wanted to get some change ready before climbing up the steps to the Lstation
She clutched my dress as we stood there a minute in a perfectly irresistible way
I know now why men marry babywomen its to feel that delicious helpless clutch of weak fingers the clutch of dependence of trust of appeal
I looked down at her with that same silly adoration Ive seen on Mollys face for her poor lacking twisted boy
At least I did in the beginning
But gradually the expression of my face must have changed for all at once I discovered what had been done to me
My purse was gone
Yes Maggie Monahan clean gone
My pocket had been as neatly picked as I myselfwell never mind as what
I threw back my head and laughed aloud
Nance Olden the great doerup had been done up so cleverly so surely so prettily that she hadnt had an inkling of it
I wished I could get a glimpse of the clever girl that did it
A girlof course it was
Do you think any boys fingers could do a job like that and me not even know
But I didnt stop to wish very long
Here was I with the thing I valued most in the world still clutched in my hand and not a nickel to my name to get me the paper and the baby on our way
It was the baby of course that decided me
You cant be very enterprising when youre carrying a pink lump of sweetness thats all asmile at the moment but may get all atear the next
Its you for the nearest police station you young tough
I said squeezing her
I cant take you home now and show you to Mag
But she giggled and gurgled back at me the abandoned thing as though the police station was just the properest place for a young lady of her years
It was not so very near either that station
My arm ached when I got there from carrying her but my heart ached too to leave her
I told the matron how and where the little thing had picked me up
At first she wouldnt leave me butthe fickle little thinga glass of milk transferred all her smiles and wiles to the matron
Then we both went over her clothes to find a name or an initial or a laundry mark
But we found nothing
The matron offered me a glass of milk too but I was in a hurry to be gone
She was a nice matron so nice that I was just about to ask her for the loan of carfare when When I heard a voice Maggie in the office adjoining
I knew that voice all right and I knew that I had to make a decision quick
I did
I threw the whole thing into the lap of Fate
And when I opened the door and faced him I was smiling
Oh yes it was Tausig
XIV
He started as though he couldnt believe his eyes when he saw me
The Lord hath delivered mine enemy into my hand shone in his evil little face
Why Mr Tausig I cried before he could get his breath
How odd to meet you here
Did you find a baby too
Did I find He glared at me
I find you thats enough
Now But the luncheon was to be at twelvethirty I laughed
And I havent changed my dress yet
Youll change it all right for something not so becoming if you dont shell out that paper
Paper
Yes paper
Look here if you give it back to me this minutenowIll not prosecute you forfor For the sake of my reputation
I suggested softly
Yes
He looked doubtfully at me mistrusting the amiable deference of my manner
That would be awfully good of you I murmured
He did not answer but watched me as though he wasnt sure which way Id jump the next moment
I wonder what could induce you to be so forgiving I went on musingly
What sort of paper is this you miss
It must be valuable Yes its valuable all right
Come on now
Quit your fooling and get down to business
Im going to have that paper
Do you know Mr Tausig I said impulsively if I were you and anybody had stolen a valuable paper from me Id have him arrested
I would
I should not care a rap what the public exposure did to his reputation so longso long I grinned right up at him so long as it didnt hurt me myself in the eyes of the law
Mad
Oh he was hopping
A German swearword burst from him
I dont know what it meant but I can imagine
Look here I give you one more chance he squeaked if you dont Whatll you do
I was sure I had him
I was sure from the very whisper in which he had spoken that the last thing in the world he wanted was to have that agreement made public by my arrest
But I tripped up on one thing
I didnt know there was a middle way for a man with money
His manner changed
Nance Olden he said aloud now I charge you with stealing a valuable private paper of mine from my desk
Here Sergeant
I hadnt particularly noticed the Sergeant standing at the other door with his back to us
But from the way he came at Tausigs call I knew hed had a private talk with him and I knew hed found the middle way
This girls taken a paper of mine
I want her searched Tausig cried
Do you mean I said that youll sign your name to such a charge against me
He didnt answer
He had pulled the Sergeant down and was whispering in his ear
I knew what that meant
It meant a special pull and a special way of doing things and Youll do well my girl to give up Mr Tausigs property to him the Sergeant said stiffly
But what have I got that belongs to him
I demanded
He grinned and shrugged his big shoulders
Weve a way of finding out you know here
Give it up or But what does he say Ive taken
What charge is there against me
Have you the right to search any woman who walks in here
And what in the world would I want a paper of Tausigs for
You wont give it up then
He tapped a bell
A woman came in
I had a bad minute there but it didnt last it wasnt the matron Id brought the baby to
Youll take this girl into the other room and search her thoroughly
The thing were looking for The Sergeant turned to Tausig
A small paper he said eagerly
Aa contractjust a single sheet of legal cap paper it was typewritten and signed by myself and some other gentlemen and folded twice
The woman looked at me
She was a bit hardmouthed with irongray hair but her eyes looked as though theyd seen a lot and learned not to flinch though they still felt like it
I knew that kind of lookId seen it at the Cruelty
What an unpleasant job this of yours is I said to her smiling up at her for all the world as that tike of a baby had smiled at me and watching her melt just as I had
Ill not make it a bit harder
This things all a mistake
Which way



Ill come back Mr Tausig to receive your apology but you can hardly expect me to go to lunch after this
He growled a wrathful resenting mouthful
But he looked a bit puzzled just the same
He looked more puzzled yet even bewildered when we came back into the main office a quarter of an hour later the woman and I and she reported that no paper of any kind had she found
Me
Oh I was sweet amiability personified with the woman and with the Sergeant who began to backwater furiously
But with Tausig What
You dont mean to say youre not on Mag
Oh dear dear its well you had that beautiful wig of red hair that puts even Carters in the shade for youd never have been a success inin other businesses I might name
Bamboozled the woman
Not a bit of it you cant deceive women with mouths and eyes like that
It was just that Id had a flash of genius in the minute I heard Tausigs voice and in spite of my being so sure he wouldnt have me arrested Id Guess Mag guess
There was only one way
The baby of course
In the moment I hadit wasnt longId stooped down pretending to kiss that cherub goodby and in a jiffy Id pinned that precious paper with a safetypin to the babys underpetticoat preferring that risk to Risk
I should say it was
And now it was up to Nance to make good
While Tausig insisted and explained and expostulated and at last walked out with the Sergeantgiving me a queer last look that was halfcursing halfplacatingI stood chatting sweetly with the woman who had searched me
I didnt know just how far I might go with her
She knew the paper wasnt on me and I could see she was disposed to believe I was as nice as shed have liked me to be
But shed had a lot of experience and she knew as most women do even without experience that if theres not always fire where there is smoke its because somebodys been clever enough and quick enough to cover the blaze
Well goodby I said putting out my hand
Its been disagreeable but Im obliged to you forwhy wheres my purse
We must have left it And I turned to go back into the room where Id undressed
You didnt have any
The words came clear and cold and positive
Her tone was like an icicle down my back
I didnt have any
I exclaimed
Why I certainly You certainly had no purse for I should have seen it and searched it if you had
Now what do you think of a woman like that
Nancy Olden I said to myself more in sorrow than in anger youve met your match right here
When a woman knows a fact and states it with such quiet conviction without the least unnecessary emphasis and not a superfluous word ware that woman
Theres only one game to play to let you hang round here a bit longer and find out whats become of the baby
Play it
I looked at her with respect it was both real and feigned
Of course you must be right I said humbly
I know you wouldnt be likely to make a mistake but just to convince me do you mind letting me go back to look
Not at all she said placidly
If I go with you theres no reason why you should not look
Oh Mag it was hard lines looking
WhyWhy because the place was so bare and so small
There were so few things to move and it took such a short time in spite of all I could do and pretend to do that I was in despair
You must be right I said at length looking woefully up at her
Yes I knew I was she said steadily
I must have lost it
Yes
There was no hope there
I turned to go
Ill lend you a nickel to get home if youll leave me your address she said after a moment
Oh that admirable woman
She ought to be ruling empires instead of searching thieves
Look at the balance of her Mag
My best acting hadnt shaken her
She hadnt that fatal curiosity to understand motives that wrecks so many who deal withwell call them the temporarily unstraight
She was satisfied just not to let me get ahead of her in the least particular
But she wasnt mean and she would lend me a nickelnot an emotionally extravagant tencent piece but just a nickelon the chance that I was what I seemed to be
Oh I did admire her but Id have been more enthusiastic about it if I could have seen my way clear to the baby and the paper
I took the nickel and thanked her but effusiveness left her unmoved
A wholesome bluegowned rock with a neat fullbibbed white apron thats what she was
And still I lingered
Fancy Nance Olden just heartbroken at being compelled to leave a police station
But there was nothing for it
Go I had to
My head was awhirl with schemes coming forward with suggestions and being dismissed as unsuitable my thoughts were flying about at such a dizzy rate while I stood there in the doorway the womans patient hand on the knob and her watchful eyes on me that I actually Mag I actually didnt hear the matrons voice the first time she spoke
The second time though I turnedso happy I could not keep the tremor out of my voice
I thought you had gone long ago she said
Oh we were friends we two
Wed chummed over a baby which for women is like what taking a drink together is for men
The admirable dragon in the blue dress didnt waver a bit because her superior spoke pleasantly to me
She only watched and listened
Which puts you in a difficult position when your names Nance Oldenyou have to tell the truth
Ive been detained I said with dignity against my wish
But thats all over
Im going now
Goodby
I nodded and caught up my skirt
Oh
I paused just as the admirable dragon was closing the door on me
Is the baby asleep
I wonder if I might see her once more
My heart was beating like an engine gone mad in spite of my careless tone and there was a buzzing in my ears that deafened me
But I managed to stand still and listen and then to walk off as though it didnt matter in the least to me while her words came smashing the hope out of me
Weve sent her with an officer back to the neighborhood where you found her
Hell find out where she belongs no doubt
Good day
IV
Ah me Maggie the miserable Nance that went away from that station
To have had your future in your grasp like that one of the Fates with the string and then to have it snatched from you by an impish breeze and blown away goodness knows where
I dont know just which way I turned after I left that station
I didnt care where I went
Nothing I could think of gave me any comfort
I tried to fancy myself coming home to you
I tried to see myself going down to tell the whole thing to Obermuller
But I couldnt do that
There was only one thing I wanted to say to Fred Obermuller and that thing I couldnt say now
But Nance Oldens not the girl to go round long like a molting hen
There was only one chance in a hundred and that was the one I took of course
Back to the Square where you found the baby Nance
I cried to myself
Theres the chance that that admirable dragon has had her suspicions aroused by your connection with the baby which she hadnt known before and has already dutifully notified the Sergeant
Theres the chance that the baby is home by now and the paper found by her mother will be turned over to her papa and then its goodby to your scheme
Theres the chance that But in the heart of me I didnt believe in any chance but onethe chance that Id find that blessed baby and get my fingers just once more on that precious paper
I blew in the ADs nickel on a crosstown car and got back to the little Square
There was another organgrinder there grinding out coonsongs to which other piccaninnies danced
But nary a little white bundle of fluff caught hold of my hand
I walked that Square till my feet were sore
It was hot
My throat was parched
I was hungry
My head ached
I was hopeless
And yet I just couldnt give it up
I had asked so many children and nursemaids whether theyd heard of the baby lost that morning and brought back by an officer that they began to look at me as though I was not quite right in my mind
The maids grabbed the children if they started to come near me and the children stared at me with big round eyes as though theyd been told I was an ogre who might eat them
I was hungry enough to
The little fruitstand at the entrance had a fascination for me
I found myself there time and again till I got afraid I might actually try to get of with a peach or a bunch of grapes
That thought haunted me
Fancy Nance Olden starved and blundering into the cheapest and most easily detected species of thieving
I suppose great generals in their hour of defeat imagine themselves doing the feeblest foolishest things
As I sat there on the bench gazing before me I saw the whole thingNancy Olden after all her bragging her skirmishing her hairbreadth scapes and successes arrested in broad daylight and before witnesses for having stolen a cool wet bunch of grapes worth a nickel for her hot dry hungering throat
I saw the policeman thatd do it he looked like that Sergeant Mulhill I met way way back in Latimers garden
I saw the officer thatd receive me he had blue eyes like the detective that came for me to the Manhattan
I saw the woman jaileroh she was the AD all right whod receive me without the slightest emotion show me to a cell and lock the door as calm as little triumphant or affected as though I hadnt once outwitted that cleverest of creaturesand outwitted myself in forestalling her
I saw Mag guess what I saw
No truly what I really saw
It made me jump to my feet and grab it with a squeal
I saw my own purse lying on the gravel almost at my feet near the little fruitstand that had tempted me
Blank empty it was stripped clean not a penny left in it not a paper not a stamp not even my key
Just the same I was glad to have it
It linked me in a way to the place
The clever little girl that had stolen it had been here in this park on this very spot
The thought of that cute young Nance Olden distracted my mind a minute from my worryand oh Maggie darlin I was worrying so
I walked up to the fruitstand with the purse in my hand
The old fellow who kept it looked up with an inviting smile
Lord knows he neednt have encouraged me to buy if Id had a penny
I want to ask you I said if you remember selling a lot of good things to a little girl who had a purse thisthis morning
I showed it to him and he turned it over in his crippled old hands
It was full thenor fuller anyway I suggested
You wouldnt want to get her into troublethat little girl
he asked cautiously
I laughed
Not I Imyself I was going to saywell you can imagine what I was going to say and that I didnt say it or anything like it
Wellthere she is Kitty Wilson over yonder he said
I gasped it was so unexpected
And I turned to look
There on one of the benches sat Kitty Wilson
If I hadnt been blind as a bat and full of troubleoh it thickens your wits does trouble and blinds your eyes and muffles your earsId have suspected something at the mere sight of her
For there sat Kitty Wilson enthroned a hatless lank little creature about twelve and near her clustered thick as ants around a lump of sugar was a crowd of children black and white boys and girls
For Kittythat deplorable Kittyhad money to burn or what was even more effective at her age she had goodies to give away
Her lap was full of spoils
She had a sample of every good thing the fruitstand offered
Her cheeks and lips were smeary with candy
Her dress was stained with fruit
The crumbs of cake lingered still on her chin and apron
And KittyI love a generous thiefwas treating the gang
It helped itself from her abundant lap it munched and gobbled and asked for more
It was a riot of a high old time
Even the birds were hopping about as near as they dared picking up the crumbs and the squirrels had peanuts to throw to the birds
And all on Nancy Oldens money
I laughed till I shook
It was good to laugh
Nancy Olden isnt accustomed to a long dose of the doleful and it doesnt agree with her
I strolled over to where my guests were banqueting
You see Mag thats where I shouldnt rank with the AD
Im too inquisitive
I want to know how the other fellow in the case feels and thinks
It isnt enough for me to see him act
Kitty I saidsomehow a twelveyearold makes you feel more of a grownup than a twelvemonthsold doesI hope youre having a goodtime Kitty Wilson buthavent you lost something
She was chewing at the end of a long string of black candyshoestrings all right the stuff looks likeand she was eating just because she didnt want to stop
Goodness knows she was full enough
Her jaws stopped though suddenly as she looked from the empty purse in my outstretched hand to me and took me in
Oh I know that pause intimately
It says Wait a minute till I get my breath and Ill know how much you know and just what lie to tell you
But she changed her mind when she saw my face
You know Mag if theres a thing thats fixed in your memory its the face of the body youve done up
The respectables have their rogues gallery but we that is the lightfingered brigade have got a fools gallery to correspond to it
In which of em is my picture
Now Margaret thats mean
You know my portrait hangs in both
I looked down on the little beggar that had painted me for the second salon and lo in a flash she was on her feet the lapful of good things tumbled to the ground and Kitty was off
I was bitterly disappointed in that girl Mag
I was altogether mistaken in my diagnosis of her
Hers is only a physical cleverness a talented dexterity
She had no resource in time of danger but her legs
And legs will not carry a grafter half so far as a good quick tongue and a steady head
She halted at a safe distance and glared back at me
Her hostility excited the crowd of childrenher pushagainst me and the braver ones jeered the things Kitty only looked while the thrifty ones stooped and gathered up the spoil
Tell her I wouldnt harm her I said to one of her lieutenants
She says she wont hurt ye Kit the child screamed
She dassent yelled back Kitty the valiant
She knows Id peach on her about the kid
Kid
What kid
I cried all afire
The kid ye swiped this mornin
Yah
I told the cop what brought her back how ye took her jest as I Kitty
I cried
You treasure
And with all my might I ran after her
Silly
Of course it was
I might have known what the short skirts above those thin legs meant
I couldnt come within fifty feet of her
I halted panting and she paused too dancing tantalizingly half a block away
What to do
I wished I had another purse to bestow on that sad Kitty but I had nothing absolutely nothing exceptall at once I remembered itthat little pin you gave me for Christmas Mag
I took it off and turned to appeal to the nearest one of the flying bodyguard that had accompanied us
You run on to her and tell her that if shell show me the house where that baby lives Ill give her this pin
He sped on ahead and parleyed with Kit and while they talked I held aloft the little pin so that Kit might see the price
She hesitated so long that I feared shed slip through my hands but a sudden rival voice piping out Ill show ye the house Missus was too much for her
So with Kit at a safe distance in advance to guard against treachery and a large and enthusiastic following I crossed the street turned a corner walked down one block and half up another and halted before a threestory brownstone
I flew up the stairs leaving my escort behind and rang the bell
It wasnt so terribly swagger a place which relieved me some
I want to see the lady whose baby was lost this morning I said to the maid that opened the door
Yesm
Wholl I tell her
Who
That stumped me
Not Nance Olden late of the Vaudeville later of the Van Twiller and latest of the police station
Nonot Nance Olden 


not 


Tell her please I said firmly that Im Miss Murieson of the XRay and that the city editor has sent me here to see her
That did it
Hooray for the power of the press
She showed me into a long parlor and I sat down and waited
It was cool and quiet and softly pretty in that long parlor
The shades were down the piano was open the chairs were low and softly cushioned
I leaned back and closed my eyes exhausted
And suddenlyMagI felt something that was a cross between a roseleaf and a snowflake touch my hand
If it wasnt that delectable baby
I caught her and lifted her to my lap and hugged the chuckling thing as though that was what I came for
Then in a moment I remembered the paper and lifted her little white slip
It was gone Mag
The underpetticoat hadnt a sign of the paper Id pinned to it
My head whirled in that minute
I suppose I was faint with the heat with hunger and fatigue and worry but I felt myself slipping out of things when I heard the rustling of skirts and there before me stood the mother of my baby
The little wretch
She deserted me and flew to that pretty mother of hers in her long cool white trailing things and sat in her arms and mocked at me
It was easy enough to begin talking
I told her a tale about being a newspaper woman out on a story how Id run across the baby and all the rest of it
I must ask your pardon I finished up for disturbing you but two things sent me hereone to know if the baby got home safe and the other I gulped to ask about a paper with some notes that Id pinned to her skirt
She shook her head
It was in that very minute that I noticed the babys ribbons were pink they had been blue in the morning
Of course I suggested youve had her clothes changed and Why yes of course said babys mother
The first thing I did when I got hold of her was to strip her and put her in a tub the second was to discharge that gossiping nurse for letting her out of her sight
And the soiled things she had onthe dress with the blue ribbons
Ill find out she said
She rang for the maid and gave her an order
Was it a valuable paper
she asked
Notvery I stammered
My tongue was thick with hope and dread
Justmy notes you know but I do need them
I couldnt carry the baby easily so I pinned them on her skirt thinkingthinking The maid came in and dumped a little heap of white before me
I fell on my knees
Oh yes I prayed all right but I searched too
And there it was
What I said to that woman I dont know even now
I flew out through the hall and down the steps and And there Kitty Wilson corralled me
Say wheres that stickpin
she cried
Herehere you darling
I said pressing it into her hand
And Kitty whenever you feel like swiping another pursejust dont do it
It doesnt pay
Just you come down to the Vaudeville and ask for Nance Olden some day and Ill tell you why
Gee
said Kitty impressed
Shallshall I call ye a hansom lady
Should she
The blessed inspiration of her
I got into the wagon and we drove down streetto the Vaudeville
I burst in past the stage doorkeeper amazed to see me and rushed into Fred Obermullers office
There
I cried throwing that awful paper on the desk before him
Now cinch em Fred Obermuller as they cinched you
Itll be the holiest blackmail that everoh and will you pay for the hansom
XVI
I dont remember much about the first part of the lunch
I was so hungry I wanted to eat everything in sight and so happy that I couldnt eat a thing
But Mr O kept piling the things on my plate and each time I began to talk hed say Not nowwait till youre rested and not quite so famished
I laughed
Do I eat as though I was starved
Youyou look tired Nance
Well I said slowly its been a hard week
Its been hard for me too harder I think than for you
It wasnt fair to me to let methink what I did and say what I did
Im so sorry Nanceand ashamed
So ashamed
You might have told me
And have you put your foot down on the whole thing not much
He laughed
Hes got such a boyish laugh in spite of his chin and his eyeglasses and the bigness of him
He filled my glass for me and helped me again to the salad
Oh Mag its such fun to be a woman and have a man wait on you like that
Its such fun to be hungry and to sit down to a jolly little table just big enough for two with carnations nodding in the tall slim vase with a fat softfooted quickhanded waiter dancing behind you and something tempting in every dish your eye falls on
Its a gay happy easy world Maggie darlin
I vow I cant find a dark corner in itnot today
None but the swellest place in town was good enough Obermuller had said for us to celebrate in
The waiters looked queerly at us when we came inme in my dusty shoes and mussed hair and old rig and Mr O in his working togs
But do you suppose we cared
He was smoking and I was pretending to eat fruit when at last I got fairly launched on my story
He listened to it all with never a word of interruption
Sometimes I thought he was so interested that he couldnt bear to miss a word I said
And then again I fancied he wasnt listening at all to me only watching me and listening to something inside of himself
Can you see him Mag sitting opposite me there at the pretty little table off in a private room by ourselves
He looked so big and strong and masterful with his eyes half closed watching me that I hugged myself with delight to think that II Nancy Olden had done something for him he couldnt do for himself
It made me so proud so tipsily vain that as I leaned forward eagerly talking I felt that same intoxicating happiness I get on the stage when the audience is all with me and the two of usmyself and the manyhanded goodnatured other fellow over on the other side of the footlightsgo careering off on a jaunt of fun and fancy like two good playmates
He was silent a minute when I got through
Then he laid his cigar aside and stretched out his hand to me
And the reason Nancethe reason for it all
I looked up at him
Id never heard him speak like that
The reason
I repeated
Yes the reason
He had caught my hand
Whyto down that tiger Trustand beat Tausig
He laughed
And that was all
Nonsense Nance Olden there was another reason
There are other tiger trusts
Are you going to set up as a ladyerrant and right all syndicate wrongs
No there was another a bigger reason Nance
Im going to tell it to youwhat
I pulled my hand from his but not before that fat waiter whod come in without our noticing had got something to grin about
Beg pardon sir he said
This message must be for you sir
Its marked immediate and no one else Obermuller took it and tore it open
He smiled the oddest smile as he read it and he threw back his head and laughed a full hearty bellow when he got to the end
Read it Nance he said passing it over to me
They sent it on from the office
I read it
Mr Fred W Obermuller Manager Vaudeville Theater New York City NY Dear ObermullerI have just learned from your little protegee Nance Olden of a comedy youve written
From what Miss Olden tells me of the plot and situations of And the Greatest of Theseyour titles greatI judge the thing to be something altogether out of the common and my secretary and reader Mr Mason agrees with me that properly interpreted and perhaps touched up here and there the comedy ought to make a hit
Would Miss Olden take the leading role I wonder
Cant you drop in this evening and talk the matter over
Theres an opening for a fellow like you with us thats just developed within the past few days andthis is strictly confidentialI have succeeded in convincing Braun and Lowenthal that their enmity is a foolish personal matter which business men shouldnt let stand in the way of business
After all just what is there between you and them
A mere trifle a misunderstanding that half an hours talk over a bottle of wine with a good cigar would drive away
If youre the man I take you for youll drop in this evening at the Van Twiller and bury the hatchet
Theyre good fellows those two and smart men even if they are stubborn as sin
Counting on seeing you tonight my dear fellow I am most cordially I M
TAUSIG
I dropped the letter and looked over at Obermuller
Miss Olden he said severely coming over to my side of the table have you the heart to harm a generous soul like that
Hehes very prompt isnt he and most And then we laughed together
You notice the letter was marked personal
Obermuller said
He was still standing beside me
Nowas it
I got up too and began to pull on my gloves but my fingers shook so I couldnt do a thing with them
Oh yes it was
Thats why I showed it to you
NanceNance dont you see that theres only one way out of this
Theres only one woman in the world that would do this for me and that I could take it from
I clasped my hands helplessly
Oh what could I do Maggie with him there and his arms ready for me
II should think youd be afraid I whispered
I didnt dare look at him
He caught me to him then
Afraid you wouldnt care for an old fellow like me
he laughed
Yes thats the only fear I had
But I lost it Nancy Nancy Obermuller when you flung that paper down before me
Thats quite two hours agohavent I waited long enough
           Oh MagMag how can I tell him
Do you think he knows that I am going to be goodgood
that I can be as good for a good man who loves me as I was bad for a bad man I loved
XVII
PHILADELPHIA January 27
Maggie dear Im writing to you just before dinner while I wait for Fred
Hes down at the boxoffice looking up advance sales
I tell you Maggie Monahan were strictly in itwe Obermullers
That Broadway hit of mine has preceded me here and weve got the town I suspect in advance
But Im not writing to tell you this
Ive got something more interesting to tell you my dear old Cruelty chum
I want you to pretend to yourself that you see me Mag as I came out of the big Chestnut Street store this afternoon my arms full of bundles
I must have on that long coat to my heels of dark warm red silklined with the long incurving back sweep and high chinchilla collar that Fred ordered made for me the very day we were married
I must be wearing that jolly little redcloth toque caught up on the side with some of the fur
Oh yes I knew I was more than a year behind the times when I got them but a successful actress wears what she pleases and the rest of the world wears what pleases her too
Besides fashions dont mean so much to you when your husband tells you how becomingbut this has nothing to do with the Bishop
Yes the Bishop Mag
I had just said Nance Olden To myself I still speak to me as Nancy Olden its good for me Mag keeps me humble and for ever grateful that Im so happy
Nance youll never be able to carry all these things and lift your buful train too
And theres never a hansom round when its snowing and And then I caught sight of the carriage
Yes Maggie the same fat low comfortable elegant sober carriage wide and wellkept with rubbertired wheels
And the two heavy horses fat and elegant and sober too and wide and wellkept
I knew whose it was the minute my eyes lighted on it and I couldntI just couldnt resist it
The man on the boxstill wide and wellkeptwas wideawake this time
I nodded to him as I slipped in and closed the door after me
Ill wait for the Bishop I said with a redcoated assurance that left him no alternative but to accept the situation respectfully
Oh dear dear
It was soft and warm inside as it had been that long longago day
The seat was wide and roomy
The cushions had been done overI resented thatbut though a different material they were a still darker plum
And instead of Quo Vadis the Bishop had been reading Resurrection
I took it up and glanced over it as I sat there but you know Mag the heavyweight plays never appealed to me
I dont go in for the tragicperhaps I saw too much of the real thing when I was little
At any rate it seemed dull to me and I put it aside and sat there absentmindedly dreaming of a little girlthief that I knew once whenwhen the handle of the door turned and the Bishop got in and we were off
Oh the little Bishopthe contrast between him and the fat pompous rig caught me
He seemed littler and leaner than ever his little white beard scantier his soft eye kindlier and his soft heart 
God bless my soul
he exclaimed jumping almost out of his neat little boots while he looked sharply over his spectacles
What did he see
Just a redcoated ghost dreaming in the corner of his carriage
It made him doubt his eyeshis sanity
I dont know what hed have done if that warm red ghost hadnt got tired of dreaming and laughed outright
Daddy I murmured sleepily
Oh that little ramrod of a bishop
The blood rushed up under his clear thin babylike skin and he sat up straight and solemn and awfulawful as such a tiny bishop could be
I fear Miss you have made a mistake he said primly
I looked at him steadily
You know I havent I said gently
That took some of the starch out of him but he eyed me suspiciously
Why dont you ask me where I got the coat Bishop Van Wagenen
I said leaning over to him
He started
I suppose hed just that moment remembered my leaving it behind that day at Mrs Ramsays
Lord bless me
he cried anxiously
You haventyou havent again No I havent
Ah Maggie dear it was worth a lot to me to be able to say that no to him
It was given to me
Guess who gave it to me
He shook his head
My husband
Maggie Monahan he didnt even blink
Perhaps in the Bishops set husbands are not uncommon or very likely they dont know what a husband like Fred Obermuller means
I congratulate you my child oror did itwere you Why Id never seen Fred Obermuller then I cried
Cant you tell a difference Bishop
I pleaded
Dont I look like aan imposing married woman now
Dont I seem a bitoh just a bit nicer
His eyes twinkled as he bent to look more closely at me
You lookyou look my little girl exactly like the pretty bigeyed wheedlingvoiced child I wished to have for my own daughter
I caught his hand in both of mine
Now thats like my own own Bishop
I cried
MagMag he was blushing like a boy a prim rather scared little schoolboy that somehow yetoh I knew he must feel kindly to me
I felt so fond of him
You see Bishop Van Wagenen I began softly I never had a father and Bless me
But you told me that day you had mistaken me forfor him
The baby
I had forgotten what that old Edward told methat this trusting soul actually still believed all Id told him
What was I to do
I tell you Mag its no light thing to get accustomed to telling the truth
You never know where itll lead you
Here was Ijust a clever little lie or two and the dear old Bishop would be happy and contented again
But no that fatal habit that Ive acquired of telling the truth to Fred and you mastered meand I fell
You know Bishop I said shutting my eyes and speaking fast to get it overas I imagine you must Mag when you confess to Father Phelanthat was all aa little farcecomedythe whole businessall of itevery last word of it
A comedy
I opened my eyes to laugh at him he was so bewildered
I mean aa fib in fact many of them
II was justit was long agoand I had to make you believe His soft old eyes looked at me unbelieving
You dont mean to say you deliberately lied
Now that was what I did meanjust what I did meanbut not in that tone of voice
But what could I do
I just looked at him and nodded
Oh Maggie I felt so little and so nasty
I havent felt like that since I left the Cruelty
And Im not nasty Maggie and Im Fred Obermullers wife and And that put a backbone in me again
Fred Obermullers wife just wont let anybody think worse of her than she can helpfrom sheer love and pride in that big clever husband of hers
Now look here Bishop Van Wagenen I broke out if I were the abandoned little wretch your eyes accuse me of being I wouldnt be in your carriage confessing to you this blessed minute when itd be so much easier not to
Surelysurely in your experience you must have met girls that go wrongand then go right for ever and ever Amen
And Im very right now
Butbut it has been hard for me at times
And at those timesah you must know how sincerely I mean itat those times I used to try to recall the sound of your voice when you said youd like to take me home with you and keep me
If I had been your daughter youd have had a heart full of loving care for me
And yet if I had been and had known that benevolent fatherhood I should need it lessso much less than I did the day I begged a prayer from you
Butits all right now
You dont knowdo youIm Nance Olden
That made him sit up and stare I tell you
Even the Bishop had heard of Nancy Olden
But suddenly unaccountably there came a queer sad look over his face and his eyes wouldnt meet mine
I looked at him puzzled
Tell me what it is I said
You evidently forget that you have already told me you are the wife of MrMr Ober Obermuller
Oh thats all right
I laughed aloud
I was so relieved
Of course I am and hes my manager and my playwright and my secretary andmymy dear dear boy
There
I wasnt laughing at the end of it
I never can laugh when I try to tell what Fred is to me
Butfunnythat won him
There
there
he said patting me on the shoulder
Forgive me my dear
I am indeed glad to know that you are living happily
I have often thought of you Oh have you
YesI have even told Mrs Van Wagenen about you and how I was attracted to you and believedahem
Ohoh have you
I gave a wriggle as I remembered that Maltese lace Maria wanted and that Iugh
But luckily he didnt notice
He had taken my hand and was looking at me over his spectacles in his dear fatherly old way
Tell me now my dear is there anything that an old clergyman can do for you
I have an engagement near here and we may not meet again
I cant hope to find you in my carriage many more times
You are happyyou are living worthily child
Pardon me but the stage Oh the gentle courtesy of his manner
I loved his solicitude
Fatherhungry girls like us Maggie know how to value a thing like that
You know I said slowly the thing that keeps a woman straight and a man faithful is not a matter of bricks and mortar nor ways of thinking nor habits of living
Its something finer and stronger than these
Its the magic taboo of her love for him and his for her that makes themsacred
With that to guard themwhy Yes yes he patted my hand softly
Still the old see the dangers of an environment that a young and impulsive woman like you my dear might be blind to
Your associates My associates
Oh youve heard about Beryl Blackburn
Wellshesshes just Beryl you know
She wasnt made to live any different
Some people steal and some drink and some gamble and some 


Well Beryl belongs to the last class
She doesnt pretend to be better than she is
And just between you and me Bishop Ive more respect for a girl of that kind than for Grace Weston whose husband is my leading man you know
Why she pulls the wool over his eyes and makes him the laughingstock of the company
I cant stand her any more than I can Marie Avon whos never without two strings All at once I stopped
But wasnt it like me to spoil it all by bubbling over
I tell you Maggie too much truth isnt good for the Bishops setthey dont know how to digest it
I was afraid that Id lost him for he spoke with a stately little primness as the carriage just then came to a stop I had been so interested talking that I hadnt noticed where we were driving
Ah here we are
he said
I must ask you to excuse me Missah Mrsthat istheres a public meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children this afternoon that I must attend
Goodby then Oh are you bound for the Cruelty too
I asked
Why so am I
Andyesyesthats the Cruelty
The Cruelty stands just where it did Mag when you and I first saw it most things do in Philadelphia you know
Theres the same prim official straight upanddownness about the brick front
The steps dont look so steep now and the buildings not so high perhaps because of a skyscraper or two thatve gone up since
But it chills your blood Maggie darlin just as it always did to think what it stands for
Not mans inhumanity to man but womens cruelty to children
Maggie think of it if you can as though this were the first time youd heard of such a thing
Would you believe it
I waked from that to find myself marching up the stairs behind the Bishops rigid little back
Oh it was stiff and uncompromising
Beryl Blackburn did that for me
Poor pretty pagan Beryl
My coming with the Bishopwe seemed to come together anywaymade the people think hed brought me so I must be just all right
I had the man bring in the toys Id got out in the carriage and I handed them over to the matron saying Theyre for the children
I want them to have them all and now please to do whatever they want with them
Therell always be others
Im going to send them right along if youll let me so that those who leave can take something of their very own with themsomething that never belonged to anybody else but just themselves you understand
Its terrible dont you know to be a deserted child or a tortured child or a crippled child and have nothing to do but sit up in that bare clean little room upstairs with a lot of other strangelingsand just think on the cruelty thats brought you here and the cruelty you may get into when you leave here
If Id had a dollif Mag had only had a set of dishes or a little tin kitchenif the boy with the gouged eye could have had a set of toolsoh cant you understand I became conscious then that the matrona new one Mag ours is gonewas staring at me and that the people stood around listening as though Id gone mad
Who came to my rescue
Why the Bishop like the manly little fellow he is
He forgave me even Beryl in that moment
Its Nance Olden ladies he said with a dignified little wave of his hand that served for an introduction
She begins her Philadelphia engagement tonight in And the Greatest of These
Oh Im used to it now Maggie but I do like it
All the ladyswells buzzed about me and there Nance stood preening herself and crowing softly tilltill from among the bunch of millinery one of them stepped up to me
She had a big smooth face with plenty of chins
Her hair was white and her nose was curved and she rustled in silk and It was Mrs Dowager Diamonds alias Henrietta alias Mrs Edward Ramsay
Clever
My how clever
she exclaimed as though the sob in my voice that I couldnt control had been a bit of acting
She was feeling for her glasses
When she got them and hooked them on her nose and got a good look at mewhy she just dropped them with a smash upon the desk
I looked for a minute from her to the Bishop
I remember you very well Mrs Ramsay
I hope you havent forgotten me
Ive often wanted to thank you for your kindness I said slowly while she as slowly recovered
I think youll be glad to know that I am thoroughly wellcured
Shall I tell Mrs Ramsay how Bishop
I put it square up to him
And he met it like the little man he isperhaps too my bit of charity to the Cruelty children had pleased him
I dont think it will be necessary Miss Olden he said gently
I can do that for you at some future time
And I could have hugged him but I didnt dare
We had tea there in the Board rooms
Oh Mag remember how we used to peep into those awful imposing Board rooms
Remember how strange and resentful you feltlike a poor little redhaired nigger up at the blockwhen you were brought in there to be shown to the woman whod called to adopt you
It was all so strange that I had to keep talking to keep from dreaming
I was talking away to the matron and the Bishop about the playroom Im going to fit up out of that bare little place upstairs
Perhaps the same child doesnt stay there very long but therell always be children to fill itmores the cruel pity
Then the Bishop and I climbed up there to see it and plan about it
But I couldnt really see it Mag nor the poor whitefaced wiseeyed little waifs that have succeeded us for the tears in my eyes and the ache at my heart and the queer trick the place has of being peopled with you and me and the boy with the gouged eye and the cripple and the rest
He put his gentle thin old arm about my shoulders for a moment when he saw what was the matter with me
Oh he understands my Bishop
And then we turned to go downstairs
OhI wantI want to do something for them I cried
I want to do something that counts thats got a heart in it that knows
You knew didnt you it was truewhat I said downstairs
I wasI am a Cruelty girl
Help me to help others like me
My dear he said very stately and sweet Ill be proud to be your assistant
Youve a kind true heart and And just at that minute as I was preceding him down the narrow steps a girl in a red coat trimmed with chinchilla and in a red toque with some of the same fur blocked our way as she was coming up
We looked at each other
Youve seen two peacocks spread their tails and strut as they pass each other
Well the peacock coming up wasnt in it with the one going down
Her coat wasnt so fine nor so heavy nor so newly smartly cut
Her toque wasnt so big nor so saucy and the fur on itnot to mention that the descending peacock was a brunette and 


well Mag I had my day
Miss Evelyn Kingdon paid me back in that minute for all the envy Ive spent on that pretty rig of hers
She didnt recognize me of course even though the two red coats were so near as she stopped to let me pass that they kissed like sisters ere they parted
But Mag Nancy Olden never got haughty that there wasnt a fall waiting for her
Back of Miss Kingdon stood Mrs Kingdonstill Mrs Kingdon thanks to Nance Oldenand behind her at the foot of the steps was a frail little oldfashioned bundle of black satin and old lace
I lost my breath when the Bishop hailed his wife
Maria he saidsome men say their wives first names all the years of their lives as they said them on their weddingdayI want you to meet Miss OldenNance Olden the comedian
Shes the girl I wanted for my daughteryoull remember its more than a year ago now since I began to talk about her
I held my breath while I waited for her answer
But her poor shortsighted eyes rested on my hot face without a sign
Its an old joke among us she said pleasantly about the Bishops daughter
We stood there and chatted and the Bishop turned away to speak to Mrs Kingdon
Then I seized my chance
Ive heard Mrs Van Wagenen I said softly and oh as nicely as I could of your fondness for lace
We are going abroad in the spring my husband and I to Malta among other places
Cant I get you a piece there as a souvenir of the Bishops kindness to me
Her little lacemittened parchmentlike hands clasped and unclasped with an almost childish eagerness
Oh thank you thank you very much but if you would give the same sum to charity I will I laughed
She couldnt guess how glad I was to do this thing
And Ill spend just as much on your lace and be so happy if youll accept it
I promised Henrietta a box for tonight Maggie and one to Mrs Kingdon
The Dowager told me shed love to come though her husband is out of town unfortunately she said
But youll come with me wont you Bishop
she said turning to him
And you Mrs
Van
The Bishop blushed
Was he thinking of Beryl I wonder
But I didnt hear his answer for it was at that moment that I caught Freds voice
He had told me he was going to call for me
I think he fancied that the old Cruelty would depress meas dreams of it have you know and he wanted to come and carry me away from it just as at night when Ive waked shivering and moaning Ive felt his dear arms lifting me out of the black nightmemory of it
But it was anything but a doleful Nance he found and hurried down the snowy steps out to a hansom and off to rehearsal
For the Bishop had said to me God bless you child when he shook hands with both of us at parting and the very Cruelty seemed to smile a grim benediction as we drove off together on Fred and NANCY O
