A FATHER INVITES DISASTER Pauline Gardiner joined us on the day that we the Second Reader class moved from the basement to the top story of the old Central Public School
Her mother brought her and leaving looked round at us meeting for an instant each pair of curious eyes with friendly appeal
We knew well the enchanted house where she livedstately retreated far into large grounds in Jefferson Street a high brick wall all round and on top of the wall broken glass set in cement
Behind that impassable barrier which so teased our young audacity were flowerbeds and shrub bushes whose blossoms were wonderfully sweet if held a while in the closed hand grape arbors and shade and fruit trees haunted by bees winding walks strewn fresh each spring with tanbark that has such a clean strong odor especially just after a rain and that is at once firm and soft beneath the feet
And in the midst stood the only apricot tree in Saint X
As few of us had tasted apricots and as those few pronounced them better far than oranges or even bananas that tree was the climax of tantalization
The place had belonged to a childless old couple who hated childrenor did they bar them out and drive them away because the sight and sound of them quickened the ache of empty old age into a pain too keen to bear
The husband died the widow went away to her old maid sister at Madison and the Gardiners coming from Cincinnati to live in the town where Colonel Gardiner was born and had spent his youth bought the place
On our way to and from school in the first weeks of that term pausing as always to gaze in through the iron gates of the drive we had each day seen Pauline walking alone among the flowers
And she would stop and smile at us but she was apparently too shy to come to the gates and we with the memory of the cross old couple awing us dared not attempt to make friends with her
She was eight years old tall for her age slender but strong naturally graceful
Her hazel eyes were always dancing mischievously
She liked boys games better than girls
In her second week she induced several of the more daring girls to go with her to the pond below town and there engage in a raftrace with the boys
And when John Dumont seeing that the girls raft was about to win thrust the one he was piloting into it and upset it she was the only girl who did not scream at the shock of the sudden tumble into the water or rise in tears from the shallow muddy bottom
She tried going barefooted she was always getting bruised or cut in attemptsusually successful at boys recklessness yet her voice was sweet and her manner toward others gentle
She hid her face when Miss Stone whipped any one more fearful far than the rise and fall of Miss Stones ferule was the soaring and sinking of her broad bristling eyebrows
From the outset John Dumont took especial delight in teasing herJohn Dumont the roughest boy in the school
He was seven years older than she but was only in the Fourth Readera laggard in his studies because his mind was incurious about books and the like was absorbed in games in playing soldier and robber in swimming and sledding in orchardlooting and fighting
He was impudent and domineering a bully but not a coward goodnatured when deferred to the feared leader of a boisterous imitative clique
Until Pauline came he had rarely noticed a girlnever except to play her some prank more or less cruel
After the adventure of the raft he watched Pauline afar off revolving plans for approaching her without impairing his barbaric dignity for subduing her without subduing himself to her
But he knew only one way of making friends the only kind of friends he had or could conceiveloyal subjects ruled through their weaknesses and fears
And as that way was to give the desired addition to his court a sound thrashing he felt it must be modified somewhat to help him in his present conquest
He tied her hair to the back of her desk he snowballed her and his sister Gladys home from school
He raided her playhouse and broke her dishes andshe giving desperate battlefled with only the parents of her doll family
With Gladys shrieking for their mother he shook her out of a tree in their yard and it sprained her ankle so severely that she had to stay away from school for a month
The net result of a years arduous efforts was that she had singled him out for detestationthis when her conquest of him was complete because she had never told on him had never in her worst encounters with him shown the white feather
But he had acted more wisely than he knew for she had at least singled him out from the crowd of boys
And there was a certain frank goodnature about him a fearlessnessand she could not help admiring his strength and leadership
Presently she discovered his secretthat his persecutions were not through hatred of her but through anger at her resistance anger at his own weakness in being fascinated by her
This discovery came while she was shut in the house with her sprained ankle
As she sat at her corner baywindow she saw him hovering in the neighborhood now in the alley at the side of the house now hurrying past whistling loudly as if bent upon some gay and remote errand now skulking along as if he had stolen something again seated on the curbstone at the farthest crossing from which he could see her window out of the corner of his eye
She understoodand forthwith forgave the past
She was immensely flattered that this big audacious creature so arrogant with the boys so contemptuous toward the girls should be her captive
When she was in her first year at the High School and he in his last he walked home with her every day and they regarded themselves as engaged
Her once golden hair had darkened now to a beautiful brown with red flashing from its waves and her skin was a clear olive pallid but healthy
And she had shot up into a tall slender young woman her mother yielded to her pleadings let her put her hair into a long knot at the back of her neck and wear skirts ALMOST to the ground
When he came from Ann Arbor for his first Christmas holidays each found the other grown into a new person
She thought him a marvel of wisdom and worldly experience
He thought her a marvel of ideal womanhoodgay lively not a bit narrow in judging him yet narrow to primness in her ideas of what she herself could do and withal charming physically
He would not have cared to explain how he came by the capacity for such sophisticated judgment of a young woman
They were to be married as soon as he had his degree and he was immediately to be admitted to partnership in his fathers woolen millsthe largest in the state of Indiana
He had been home three weeks of the long vacation between his sophomore and junior years
There appeared on the towns big and busy stream of gossip stories of his life at Ann Arborof drinking and gambling and wild tears in Detroit
And it was noted that the fast young men of Saint Xso every one called Saint Christopherwere going a more rapid gait
Those turbulent fretters against the dam of dullness and stern repression of even normal and harmless gaiety had long caused scandal
But never before had they been so daring so defiant
One night after leaving Pauline he went to play poker in Charley Braddocks rooms
Braddock only son of the richest banker in Saint X had furnished the loft of his fathers stable as bachelor quarters and entertained his friends there without fear that the noise would break the sleep and rouse the suspicions of his father
That night besides Braddock and Dumont there were Jim Cauldwell and his brother Will
As they played they drank and Dumont winning steadily became offensive in his raillery
There was a quarrel a fight Will Cauldwell accidently toppled down a steep stairway by Dumont was picked up with a broken arm and leg
By noon the next day the town was boiling with this outbreak of deviltry in the leading young men the sons and prospective successors of the bulwarks of religion and morality
The Episcopalian and Methodist ministers preached against Dumont that importer of Satans ways into our peaceful midst and against Charley Braddock with his anteroom to Sheolthe Reverend Sweetser had just learned the distinction between Sheol and Hades
The Presbyterian preacher wrestled spiritually with Will Cauldwell and so wrought upon his depression that he gave out a solemn statement of confession remorse and reform
In painting himself in dark colors he painted Jack Dumont jet black
Pauline had known that Dumont was livelyhe was far too proud of his wild oats wholly to conceal them from her
And she had all the tolerance and fascinated admiration of feminine youth for the friskiness of masculine freedom
Thus though she did not precisely approve what he and his friends had done she took no such serious view of it as did her parents and his
The most she could do with her father was to persuade him to suspend sentence pending the conclusion of an investigation into Jacks doings at the University of Michigan and in Detroit
Colonel Gardiner was not so narrow or so severe as Jack said or as Pauline thought
He loved his daughter so he inquired thoroughly
He knew that his daughter loved Dumont so he judged liberally
When he had done he ordered the engagement broken and forbade Dumont the house
He is not wild merely he isworse than you can imagine said the colonel to his wife in concluding his account of his discoveries and of Dumonts evasive and reluctant admissionsan account so carefully expurgated that it completely misled her
Tell Pauline as much as you canenough to convince her
This when Mrs Gardiner was not herself convinced
She regarded the colonel as too highminded to be a fit judge of human frailty and his overcaution in explanation had given her the feeling that he had a standard for a husband for their daughter which only another such rare man as himself could live up to
Further she had always been extremely reserved in motheranddaughter talk with Pauline and thus could not now give her a clear idea of what little she had been able to gather from Colonel Gardiners halftruths
This typical enacting of a familiar domestic comedytragedy had the usual result the girl was confirmed in her original opinion and stand
Jacks been a little too lively was her unexpressed conclusion from her mothers dilution of her fathers dilution of the ugly truth
Hes sorry and wont do it again andwell Id hate a milksop
Father has forgotten that he was young himself once
Dumonts father and mother charged against Ann Arbor that which they might have charged against their own alternations of tyranny and license had they not been humanly lenient in selfexcuse
No more college
said his father
The place for you young man is my office where I can keep an eye or two on you
That suits me replied the son indifferentlyhe made small pretense of repentance at home
I never wanted to go to college
Yes it was your mothers doing said old Dumont
Now well try MY way of educating a boy
So Jack entered the service of his fathers godofthesixdays and immediately showed astonishing talent and twelvetofourteenhour assiduity
He did not try to talk with Pauline
He went nowhere but to business he avoided the young men
Its a bad idea to let your home town know too much about you he reflected and he resolved that his future gambols out of bounds should be in the security of distant and large citiesand they were
Seven months after he went to work he amazed and delighted his father by informing him that he had bought five hundred shares of stock in the millshe had made the money fiftyodd thousand dollars by a speculation in wool
He was completely reestablished with his father and with all Saint X except Colonel Gardiner
That young Jack Dumonts a wonder said everybody
Hell make the biggest kind of a fortune or the biggest kind of a smash before he gets through
He felt that he was fully entitled to the rights of the regenerate he went to Colonel Gardiners law office boldly to claim them
At sight of him the colonels face hardened into an expression as near to hate as its habit of kindliness would concede
Well sir
said he sharply eying the young man over the tops of his glasses
Dumont stiffened his strong rather stocky figure and said his face a study of youthful frankness You know what Ive come for sir
I want you to give me a trial
No
Colonel Gardiner shut his lips firmly
Good morning sir
And he was writing again
You are very hard said Dumont bitterly
You are driving me to ruin
How DARE you
The old man rose and went up to him eyes blazing scorn
You deceive others but not me with my daughters welfare as my first duty
It is an insult to her that you presume to lift your eyes to her
Dumont colored and haughtily raised his head
He met the colonels fiery gaze without flinching
I was no worse than other young men Its a slander upon young men for you to say that theythat any of them with a spark of decencywould do as you have done as you DO
Leave my office at once sir
Ive not only repentedIve shown that I was ashamed ofof that said Dumont
Yet you refuse me a chance
The colonel was shaking with anger
You left here for New York last Thursday night he said
Where and how did you spend Saturday night and Sunday and Monday
Dumonts eyes shifted and sank
Its false he muttered
Its lies
I expected this call from you continued Colonel Gardiner and I prepared for it so that I could do what was right
Id rather see my daughter in her shroud than in a weddingdress for you
Dumont left without speaking or looking up
The old fox
he said to himself
Spying on mewhat an idiot I was not to look out for that
The narrow old fool
He doesnt know what man of the world means
But Ill marry her in spite of him
Ill let nobody cheat me out of what I want what belongs to me
A few nights afterward he went to a dance at Braddocks hunted out Pauline and seated himself beside her
In a year he had not been so near her though they had seen each other every few days and he had written her many letters which she had read had treasured but had been held from answering by her sense of honor unless her looks whenever their eyes met could be called answers
You mustnt Jack she said her breath coming fast her eyes feverbright
Father has forbidden meand itll only make him the harder
You too Polly
Well then I dont care what becomes of me
He looked so desperate that she was frightened
It isnt that Jackyou KNOW it isnt that
Ive been to see your father
And he told me hed never consentnever
I dont deserve thatand I cant stand it to lose you
No matter what Ive done God knows I love you Polly
Paulines face was pale
Her hands in her lap were gripping her little handkerchief
You dont say that tooyou dont say never
She raised her eyes to his and their look thrilled through and through him
Yes John I say neverIll NEVER give you up
All the decent instincts in his nature showed in his handsome face in which time had not as yet had the chance clearly to write character
No wonder I love youthere never was anybody so brave and so true as you
But you must help me
I must see you and talk to youonce in a while anyhow
Pauline flushed painfully
Not tilltheylet meor Im older John
Theyve always trusted me and left me free
And I cant deceive them
He liked thisit was another proof that she was through and through the sort of woman who was worthy to be his wife
Wellwell wait he said
And if they wont be fair to us why well have a right to do the best we can
He gave her a tragic look
Ive set my heart on you Polly and I never can stand it not to get what Ive set my heart on
If I lost you Id go straight to ruin
She might have been a great deal older and wiser and still not have seen in this a confirmation of her fathers judgment of her lover
And her parents had unconsciously driven her into a mental state in which if he had committed a crime it would have seemed to her their fault rather than his
The next day she opened the subject with her motherthe subject that was never out of their minds
I cant forget him mother
I CANT give him up
With the splendid confidence of youth I can save himhell do anything for my sake
With the touching ignorance of youth Hes done nothing so very dreadful Im sureId believe him against the whole world
And in the evening her mother approached her father
She was in sympathy with Pauline though her loyalty to her husband made her careful not to show it
She had small confidence in a mans judgments of men on their womanside great confidence in the power of women to change and uplift men
Father said she when they were alone on the side porch after supper have you noticed how hard Polly is taking IT
His eyes and the sudden deepening of the lines in his face answered her
Dont you think maybe weve been a littletoosevere
Ive tried to think so but He shook his head
Maggie hes hopeless hopeless
I dont know much about those things
This was a mere form of speech
She thought she knew all there was to be known and as she was an intelligent woman who had lived a long time and had a normal human curiosity she did know a great deal
But after the fashion of many of the women of the older generation she had left undisturbed his delusion that her goodness was the result not of intelligence but of ignorance
But I cant help fearing it isnt right to condemn a young man forever because he was led away as a boy
I cant discuss it with you Maggieits a degradation even to speak of him before a good woman
You must rely upon my judgment
Polly must put him out of her head
But what am I to tell her
You cant make a woman like our Pauline put a man out of her life when she loves him unless you give her a reason that satisfies her
And if you dont give ME a reason that satisfies me how can I give HER a reason that will satisfy her
Ill talk to her said the colonel after a long pause
She mustshe shall give him up mother
Ive tried to persuade her to go to visit Olivia continued Mrs Gardiner
But she wont
And she doesnt want me to ask Olivia here
Ill ask Olivia before I speak to her
Mrs Gardiner went up to her daughters roomit had been her playroom then her study and was now graduated into her sittingroom
She was dreaming over a bookTennysons poems
She looked up eyes full of hope
He has some good reason dear began her mother
What is it
demanded Pauline
I cant tell you any more than Ive told you already replied her mother trying not to show her feelings in her face
Why does he treat metreat youlike two naughty little children
said Pauline impatiently tossing the book on the table
Pauline
Her mothers voice was sharp in reproof
How can you place any one before your father
Pauline was silentshe had dropped the veil over herself
IIwhere did you place fatherwhenwhen Her eyes were laughing again
You know hed never oppose your happiness Polly
Mrs Gardiner was smoothing her daughters turbulent redbrown hair
Youll only have to wait under a little more trying circumstances
And if hes right the truth will come out
And if hes mistaken and Johns all you think him then that will come out
Pauline knew her father was not opposing her through tyranny or pride of opinion or sheer prejudice but she felt that this was another case of ages lack of sympathy with youth felt it with all the intensity of infatuated seventeen made doubly determined by opposition and concealment
The next evening he and she were walking together in the garden
He suddenly put his arm round her and drew her close to him and kissed her
You know I shouldnt if I didnt think it the only coursedont you Pauline
he said in a broken voice that went straight to her heart
Yes father
Then after a silence Butweweve been sweethearts since we were children
AndIfather I MUST stand by him
Wont you trust me child
Wont you believe ME rather than him
Paulines only answer was a sigh
They loved each the other he adored her she reverenced him
But between them thick and high rose the barrier of custom and training
Comradeship confidence were impossible
II
OLIVIA TO THE RESCUE
With the first glance into Olivias dark gray eyes Pauline ceased to resent her as an intruder
And soon she was feeling that some sort of dawn was assailing her night
Olivia was the older by three years
She seemedand for her years wasserious and wise because as the eldest of a large family she was lieutenantgeneral to her mother
Further she had always had her own waywhen it was the right way and did not conflict with justice to her brothers and sisters
And often her parents let her have her own way when it was the wrong way nor did they spoil the lesson by mitigating disagreeable consequences
Do as you please her mother used to say when doing as she pleased would involve less of mischief than of valuable experience and perhaps youll learn to please to do sensibly
Again
her father would restrain her mother from interferenceOh let the girl alone
Shes got to teach herself how to behave and she cant begin a minute too young
This training had produced a selfreliant and selfgoverning Olivia
She wondered at the change in PaulinePauline the lighthearted the effervescent of laughter and life now silent and almost somber
It was two weeks before she not easily won to the confiding mood for all her frankness let Olivia into her secret
Of course it was at night of course they were in the same bed
And when Olivia had heard she came nearer to the truth about Dumont than had Paulines mother
But while she felt sure there was a way to cure Pauline she knew that way was not the one which had been pursued
Theyve only made her obstinate she thought as she lying with hands clasped behind her head watched Pauline propped upon an elbow staring with dreamful determination into the moonlight
Itll come out all right she said her voice always suggested that she knew what she was talking about
Your fatherll give in sooner or laterif YOU dont change
But hes so bitter against Jack replied Pauline
He wont listen to his sideto our sideof it
Anyhow whats the use of anticipating trouble
You wouldnt get married yet
And if hes worthwhile hell wait
Pauline had been even gentler than her own judgment in painting her lover for her cousins inspection
So she could not explain to her why there was necessity for haste could not confess her conviction that every month he lived away from her was a month of peril to him
We want it settled she said evasively
I havent seen him around anywhere went on Olivia
Is he here now
Hes in Chicagoin charge of his fathers office there
He may stay all winter
No theres no hurry went on Olivia
Besides you ought to meet other men
It isnt a good idea for a girl to marry the man shes been brought up with before shes had a chance to get acquainted with other men
Olivia drew this maxim from experienceshe had been engaged to a schooldays lover when she went away to Battle Field to college she broke it off when going home on vacation she saw him again from the point of wider view
But Pauline scorned this theory if Olivia had confessed the broken engagement she would have thought her shallow and untrustworthy
She was confident with inexperiences sublime incapacity for selfdoubt that in all the wide world there was only one man whom she could have loved or could love
Oh I shant change she said in a tone that warned her cousin against discussion
At any rate replied Olivia a little experience would do you no harm
She suddenly sat up in bed
A splendid idea
she exclaimed
Why not come to Battle Field with me
Id like it said Pauline always eager for selfimprovement and roused by Olivias stories of her college experiences
But fatherd never let me go to Battle Field College
Battle Field UNIVERSITY corrected Olivia
It has classical courses and scientific courses and a preparatory schooland a military department for men and a music department for women
And its going to have lots and lots of real university schoolswhen it gets the money
And theres a healthy middleaged wagonmaker whos said to be thinking of leaving it a million or soif he should ever die and if they should change its name to his
But its coeducation isnt it
Father would never consent
It was all mother could do to persuade him to let me go to public school
But maybe hed let you go with me where he wouldnt let you go all alone
And so it turned out
Colonel Gardiner anxious to get his daughter away from Saint X and into new scenes where Dumont might grow dim consented as soon as Olivia explained her plan
Instead of entering senior prep Pauline was able to make freshman with only three conditions
In the first week she was initiated into Olivias fraternity the Kappa Alpha Kappa joined the womans literary and debating society and was fascinated and absorbed by crowding new events associations occupations thoughts
In spite of herself her oldtime high spirits came flooding back
She caught herself hummingand checked herself reproachfully
She caught herself singingand lowered it to humming
She caught herself whistlingand decided that she might as well be cheerful while she waited for fate to befriend her and Jack
And she found that she thought about him none the less steadfastly for thinking hopefully
Battle Field put no more restraint upon its young women than it put upon its young menand it put no restraint upon the young men
In theory and practice it was democratic American westernan outgrowth of that pioneer life in which the men and the women had fought and toiled and enjoyed side by side in absolute equality with absolute freedom of association
It recognized that its students had been brought up in the free simple frank way that all came from a region where individualism was a religion with selfreliance as the cardinal principle of faith and selfdevelopment as the goal
There were no dormitories at Battle Field then
Olivia and Pauline lived in one of the hundred or more boardinghousesa big square white frame kept by a Mrs Trent the widow of a hero of two wars
Her hero had won her with his uniform when he returned from the Mexican War
His conduct was so irregular and his income so uncertain that it had been a relief to her when he departed for his second war
From it he had brought home a broken constitution a maimed body and confirmed habits of shiftlessness and drunkenness
His country took his character and his health and paid him in exchange a pension which just about kept him in whisky and tobacco
So long as he was alive Mrs Trent hated him as vigorously as her Christianity permitted
When he was safely in his grave she canonized him she put his picture and his sword belt and epaulets in the conspicuous place in the parlor she used his record for gallantry to get herself social position and a place of honor at public gatherings
Her house stood back from the highway in a grove of elms and walnuts
Its angularity was relieved by a porch with a flat roof that had a railing about it and served as a balcony for the secondstory lodgers
There were broad halls through the middle of the house downstairs and up
Olivia and Pauline had the three large rooms in the second story on the south side
They used the front room as a study and Paulines bedroom was next to it
Late one afternoon she was seated at the study window watching a cherryred sun drop through the purple haze of the autumn
She became conscious that some one was on the balcony before the window of the front room across the hall
She leaned so that she could see without being seen
Sharp against the darkening sky was the profile of a young man
Olivia joined her and followed her glance
The profile remained fixed and the two girls watched it fascinated
It certainly was a powerful outline proud and stern but with a mouth that was sweet in its kindliness and gentleness
I wonder what hes thinking about said Olivia in an undertone he was not fifteen feet from them
I suppose some scheme for conquering the world
Most of Battle Fields youth came from the farms of that western country the young men with bodies and brains that were strong but awkward
Almost all were working their way throughas were not a few of the women
They felt that life was a large serious business impatiently waiting for them to come and attend to it in a large serious way better than it had ever been attended to before
They studied hard they practised oratory and debating
Their talk was of history and philosophy religion and politics
They slept little they thoughtor tried to thinkeven more than they talked
At a glance this man was one of them a fine type
Hes handsome isnt he
said Pauline
But She did not finish indeed it was not clear to her what the rest of her protest was
He reminded her of Dumontthere was the same look of superiority of the born to lead
But his face seemed to have some quality which Dumonts lackedor was it only the idealizing effect of the open sky and the evening light
When the bell rang for supper he apparently did not hear it
The two girls went down and had talked to the others a few minutes and all had seated themselves before he entered
An inch or so above six feet powerful in the chest and shoulders he moved with a large grace until he became selfconscious or approached the by comparison frail pieces of furniture
He had penetrating candid eyes that looked dark in the gaslight but were steelblue
His face now wore the typical westernAmerican expressionshrewd easygoing good humor
Mrs Trent intrenched in state behind a huge silverplated coffeeurn with ivorytrimmed faucet introduced himMr Scarboroughto Olivia to Pauline to Sadie McIntosh to Pierson and Howe and Thiebaud pronounced Caybo
Scarborough sat directly opposite Olivia
But whenever he lifted his eyes from his plate he looked at Pauline who was next to her
When she caught him he blushed and stirred in his chair so uneasily that it creaked and crackled and his normal difficulties with his large hands and the small knife and fork were distressingly increased
Pauline was disappointed in himhis clothes were illfitting and gave him the appearance of being in danger of bursting from them his hair was too long suggesting a shaggy tawny mane though his hands were wellshaped they had the recent scars of hard manual labor
Thus when Olivia spoke enthusiastically of him after supper she made no reply
She would have been ashamed to acknowledge the reasons for her lack of admiration even had she been conscious of them
But the next morning at breakfast she revised her opinion somewhat
He talked and he had a remarkable voiceclear musical with a quality which made it seem to penetrate through all the nerves instead of through the auditory nerve only
Further he talked straight to Pauline without embarrassment and with a quaint satiric humor
She was forgetting for the moment his almost uncouth hair and dress when in making a sweeping gesture he upset a glass of water and sent a plate of hot bread flying from the waitress hand
Hed do well in the open air thought she but hes out of place in a house
Still she found him interesting and original
And he persistently sought herhis persistence was little short of heroism in view of the neverwhollyconcealed sufferings which the contrast between her grace and style and his lack of both caused him
He looks like a king who had been kidnapped as a child and brought up in the wilds said Olivia
I wonder who he is
Ill ask him replied Pauline
And Olivia was slyly amused by her cousins unconscious pride in her power with this large untamed person
III
AND SCARBOROUGH
His name was Hampden Scarborough and he came from a farm about twenty miles east of Saint X
He was descended from men who had learned to hate kings in Holland in the sixteenth century had learned to despise them in England in the seventeenth century had learned to laugh at them in America in the eighteenth century had learned to exalt themselves into kingsthe kings of the new democracyin the free West in the nineteenth century
When any one asked his father Bladen Scarborough who the family ancestors were Bladen usually did not answer at all
It was his habit thus to treat a question he did not fancy and if the question was repeated to supplement silence with a piercing look from under his aggressive eyebrows
But sometimes he would answer it
Once for example he looked coldly at the man who with a covert sneer had asked it said Youre impudent sir
You insinuate Im not enough by myself to command your consideration and struck him a staggering blow across the mouth
Againhe was in a playful mood that day and the questioner was a womanhe replied Im descended from murderers maammurderers
And in a sense it was the truth
In 1568 the Scarboroughs were seated obscurely in an east county of England
They were tenant farmers on the estates of the Earl of Ashford and had been strongly infected with leveling ideas by the refugees then fleeing to England to escape the fury of continental prince and priest
John Scarborough was trudging along the highway with his sister Kate
On horseback came Aubrey Walton youngest son of the Earl of Ashford
He admired the rosy pretty face of Kate Scarborough
He dismounted and without so much as a glance at her brother put his arm round her
John snatched her free
Young Walton all amazement and wrath at the hind who did not appreciate the favor he was condescending to bestow upon a humble maiden ripped out an insult and drew his sword
John wrenched it from him and ran it through his body
That night with four gold pieces in his pocket John Scarborough left England in a smuggler and was presently fighting Philip of Spain in the army of the Dutch people
In 1653 Zachariah Scarborough great grandson of the preceding was a soldier in Cromwells army
On the night of April twentieth he was in an alehouse off Fleet Street with three brother officers
That day Cromwell had driven out Parliament and had dissolved the Council of State
Three of the officers were of Cromwells party the fourth Captain Zachariah Scarborough was a levelera hater of kings a Dutchbred pioneer of Dutchbred democracy
The discussion began hotand they poured ale on it
Hes a tyrant
shouted Zachariah Scarborough bringing his huge fist down on the table and upsetting a mug
He has set up for king
Down with all kings say I
His head must come off
At this knives were drawn and when Zachariah Scarborough staggered into the darkness of filthy Fleet Street with a cut down his cheek from temple to jawbone his knife was dripping the life of a cousin of Iretons
He fled to the Virginia plantations and drifted thence to North Carolina
His greatgrandson Gaston Scarborough was one of Marions men in his boyhooda fierce spirit made arrogant by isolated freedom where every man of character owned his land and could conceive of no superior between him and Almighty God
One autumn day in 1794 Gaston was out shooting with his youngest brother John their fathers favorite
Gastons gun was caught by a creeper was torn from him and his hand reaching for it exploded the charge into his brothers neck
His brother fell backward into the swamp and disappeared
Gaston plunged into the wildernessto Tennessee to Kentucky to Indiana
And its my turn said Hampden Scarborough as he ended a brief recital of the ancestral murders which Pauline had drawn from himthey were out for a walk together
Your turn
she inquired
YesIm the greatgrandsonthe only one
Its always a greatgrandson
You DO look dangerous said Pauline and the smile and the glance she sent with the words might have been misunderstood by a young man entertaining the ideas which were then filling that young mans brain
Again he told her how he had been sent to collegeshe was always leading him to talk of himself and her imagination more than supplied that which his unaffected modesty sometimes deliberately more often unconsciously kept out of his stories
Ever since he could remember his strongest passion had been for books for reading
Before he was born the wilderness was subdued and the cruel toil of his parents early life was mitigated by the growth of towns the spread of civilization
There was a chance for some leisure for the higher gratification of the intense American passion for education
A small library had sprung up in one corner of the general room of the old farmhousefrom the seeds of a Bible an almanac Miltons Paradise Lost Baxters Saints Rest and a Government report on cattle
But the art collection had stood still for yearsa facsimile of the Declaration of Independence another of the Emancipation Proclamation pictures of Washington Lincoln and Napoleon the last held in that household second only to Washington in all history as a leveler
The only daughter Arabella had been sent to boardingschool in Cincinnati
She married a rich man lived in the city and under the inspiration of English novels and the tutelage of a woman friend who visited in New York and often went abroad was developing ideas of family and class and rank
She talked feelingly of the lower classes and of the duty of the upper class toward them
Her goingson created an acid prejudice against higher education in her fathers mind
As she was unfolding to him a plan for sending Hampden to Harvard he interrupted with No MORE idiots in my family at my expense and started out to feed the pigs
The best terms Hampdens mother could make were that he should not be disinherited and cast off if he went to Battle Field and paid his own way
He did not tell Pauline all of this nor did he repeat to her the conversation between himself and his father a few days before he left home
Is Bella going to pay your way through
asked his father looking at him severelybut he looked severely at every one except Hampdens gentlevoiced mother
No sir
The sons voice was clear
Is your mother
No sir
Have you got money put by
Four hundred dollars
Is that enough
Itll give me time for a long look around
The old man drew a big rusty pocketbook from the inside pocket of the oldfashioned floweredvelvet waistcoat he wore even when he fed the pigs
He counted out upon his knee ten onehundreddollar bills
He held them toward his son
Thatll have to do you he said
Thats all youll get
No thank you replied Hampden
I wish no favors from anybody
Youve earned it over and above your keep retorted his father
It belongs to you
If I need it Ill send for it said Hampden that being the easiest way quickly to end the matter
But he did tell Pauline that he purposed to pay his own way through college
My father has a notion said he that the things one works for and earns are the only things worth having
And I think one cant begin to act on that notion too early
If one is trying to get an education why not an allround education instead of only lessons out of books
From that moment Pauline ceased to regard dress or any other external feature as a factor in her estimate of Hampden Scarborough
But your plan might make a man too late in getting a startsome men at least she suggested
A startfor what
he asked
For fame or fortune or success of any kind
Scarboroughs eyes fixed on the distance had a curious look in themhe was again exactly like that first view she had had of him
But suppose one isnt after any of those things he said
Suppose he thinks of life as simply an opportunity for selfdevelopment
He starts at it when hes born and the more of it he does the more he has to do
Andhe cant possibly fail and every moment is a triumphand He came back from his excursion and smiled apologetically at her
But she was evidently interested
Dont you think a man ought to have ambition
she asked
She was thinking of her lover and his audacious schemes for making himself powerful
Oha man is what he is
Ambition means so many different things
But shouldnt you like to be rich and famous andall that
It depends Scarborough felt that if he said what was in his mind it might sound like cant
So he changed the subject
Just now my ambition is to get off that zoology condition
IV
A DUMONT TRIUMPH
But in the first week of her second month Paulines interest in her surroundings vanished
She was corresponding with Jennie Atwater and Jennie began to write of Dumonthe had returned to Saint X Caroline Sylvester of Cleveland was visiting his mother it was all but certain that Jack and Caroline would marry
Her people want it Jennie went onshe pretended to believe that Jack and Pauline had given each the other upand Jacks father is determined on it
Theyre together morning noon and evening
Shes really very swell though I dont think shes such a raving beauty
Following this came the Saint X NewsBulletin with a broad hint that the engagement was about to be announced
Its ridiculously false said Pauline to herself but she tossed for hours each night trying to soothe the sick pain in her heart
And while she scouted the possibility of losing him she was for the first time entertaining ita cloud in the great horizon of her faith in the future a small cloud but black and bold against the blue
And she had no suspicion that he had returned from Chicago deliberately to raise that cloud
A few days later another letter from Jennie full of gossip about Jack and Caroline a NewsBulletin with a long article about Caroline ending with an even broader hint of her approaching marriageand Dumont sent Pauline a note from the hotel in Villeneuve five miles from Battle Field I must see you
Do not deny me
It means everything to both of uswhat I want to say to you
And he asked her to meet him in the little park in Battle Field on the bank of the river where no one but the factory hands and their families ever went and they only in the evenings
The hour he fixed was ten the next morning and she cut ancient history and was there
As he advanced to meet her she thought she had never before appreciated how handsome he was how distinguishedlookingperfectly her ideal of what a man should be especially in that important and at Battle Field neglected matter dress
She was without practice in indirection but she successfully hid her jealousy and her fears though his manner was making their taunts and threats desperately real
He seemed depressed and gloomy he would not look at her he shook hands with her almost coldly though they had not seen each other for weeks had not talked together for months
She felt faint and her thoughts were like flocks of circling croaking crows
Polly he began when they were in the secluded corner of the park father wants me to get married
Hes in a rage at your father for treating me so harshly
He wants me to marry a girl whos visiting us
Hes always at me about it making all sorts of promises and threats
Her fathers in the same business that we are and He glanced at her to note the effect of his words
She had drawn her tall figure to its full height and her cheeks were flushed and her eyes curiously bright
He had stabbed straight and deep into the heart of her weakness but also into the heart of her pride
The only effect of his thrust that was visible to him put him in a panic
DontPLEASE dont look that way Polly he went on hastily
You dont see what Im driving at yet
I didnt mean that Id marry her or think of it
There isnt anybody but you
There couldnt be you know that
Why did you tell me then
she asked haughtily
BecauseI had to begin somewhere
Polly Im going away going abroad
And Im not to see you forfor I dont know how longandwe must be married
She looked at him in a daze
We can cross on the ferry at halfpast ten he went on
You see that housethe white one
He pointed to the other bank of the river where a white cottage shrank among the trees not far from a little church
Mr Barker lives thereyou must have heard of him
Hes married scores and hundreds of couples from this side
And we can be back here at halfpast eleventwelve at the latest
She shook her head expressed not determination only doubt
I cant Jack she said
They Then you arent certain youre ever going to marry me he interrupted bitterly
You dont mean what you promised me
You care more for them than you do for me
You dont really care for me at all
You dont believe that she protested her eyes and her mind on the little white cottage
You couldntyou know me too well
Then theres no reason why we shouldnt get married
Dont we belong to each other now
Why should we refuse to stand up and say so
That seemed unanswerablea perfect excuse for doing what she wished to do
For the little white cottage fascinated herhow she did long to be sure of him
And she felt so free so absolutely her own mistress in these new surroundings where no one attempted to exercise authority over another
I must feel sure of you Pauline
Sometimes everything seems to be against me and I even doubt you
Andthats when the temptations pull hardest
If we were married itd all be different
Yes it would be different
And he would be securely hers with her mind at rest instead of harassed as it would be if she let him go so far away free
And where was the harm in merely repeating before a preacher the promise that now bound them both
She looked at him and he at her
You dont put any others before me do you dear
he asked
No Jackno one
I belong to you
Come
he pleaded and they went down to the boat
She seemed to herself to be in a dreamin a trance
As she walked beside him along the country road on the other shore a voice was ringing in her ears Dont
Dont
Ask Olivias advice first
But she walked on her will suspended substituted for it his will and her jealousy and her fears of his yielding to the urgings of his father and the blandishments of that Cleveland girl
He said little but kept close to her watching her narrowly touching her tenderly now and then
The Reverend Josiah Barker was waiting for theman oily smirk on a face smooth save where a thin fringe of white whiskers dangled from his jawbone ear to ear fat damp hands rubbing in anticipation of the large fee that was to repay him for celebrating the marriage and for keeping quiet about it afterward
At the proper place in the brief ceremony Dumont with a sly smile at Pauline which she faintly returned produced the ringhe had bought it at Saint X a week before and so had started a rumor that he and Caroline Sylvester were to be married in haste
He held Paulines hand firmly as he put the ring on her fingerhe was significantly cool and calm for his age and for the circumstances
She was trembling violently was pale and wan
The ring burned into her flesh
Whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder ended Barker with pompous solemnity
Dumont kissed herher cheek was cold and at the touch of his lips she shuddered
Dont be afraid he said in a low voice that was perfectly steady
They went out and along the sunny road in silence
Whom God hath joined the voice was now dinning into her ears
And she was saying to herself Has GOD joined us
If so why do I feel as if I had committed a crime
She looked guiltily at himshe felt no thrill of pride or love at the thought that he was her husband she his wife
And into her mind poured all her fathers condemnations of him with a vague menacing fear riding the crest of the flood
Youre sorry youve done it
he said sullenly
She did not answer
Well its done he went on and it cant be undone
And Ive got you Polly in spite of them
They might have known better than to try to keep me from getting what I wanted
I always did and I always shall
She looked at him startled then hastily looked away
Even more than his words and his tone she disliked his eyesgloating triumphant
But not until she was years more experienced did she study that neverforgotten expression study it as a wholewords tone look
Then and not until then did she know that she had instinctively shrunk because he had laid bare his base and all but loveless motive in marrying her
And he added Ill force father to give me a big interest in the business very soon
Thenwell announce it
Announce IT
Announce WHAT
Why Im a married woman she thought and she stumbled and almost fell
The way danced before her eyes all spotted with black
She was just able to walk aboard the boat and drop into a seat
He sat beside her took her hand and bent over it as he kissed it a tear fell on it
He looked at her and she saw that his eyes were swimming
A sob surged into her throat but she choked it back
Jack
she murmured and hid her face in her handkerchief
When they looked each at the other both smiledher foreboding had retreated to the background
She began to turn the ring round and round upon her finger
Mrs John Dumont she said
Doesnt it sound queer
And she gazed dreamily away toward the ranges of hills between which the river danced and sparkled as it journeyed westward
When she again became conscious of her immediate surroundingsother than Dumontshe saw a deckhand looking at her with a friendly grin
Instantly she covered the ring with her hand and handkerchief
But I mustnt wear it she said to Dumont
Nonot on your finger
He laughed and drew from his pocket a slender gold chain
But you might wear it on this round your neck
Itll help to remind you that you dont belong to yourself any more but to me
She took the chainshe was coloring in a most becoming wayand hid it and the ring in her bosom
Then she drew off a narrow hoop of gold with a small setting and pushed it on his big little finger
And THAT sir she said with a bewitching look may help you not to forget that YOU belong to me
She left the ferry in advance of him and faced Olivia just in time for them to go down together to the halfpast twelve oclock dinner
V FOUR FRIENDS
As Mrs Trents was the best board in Battle Field there were more applicants than she could make places for at her one table
In the second week of the term she put a small table in the alcove of the diningroom and gave it to her star boardersPierson Olivia and Pauline
They invited Scarborough to take the fourth place
Not only did Pierson sit opposite Olivia and Scarborough opposite Pauline three times a day in circumstances which make for intimacy but also Olivia and Pierson studied together in his sittingroom and Pauline and Scarborough in her sittingroom for several hours three or four times a week
Olivia and Pierson were sophomores
Pauline and Scarborough were freshmen also they happened to have the same three senior prep conditions to work offLatin zoology and mathematics
Such intimacies as these were the matterofcourse at Battle Field
They were usually brief and strenuous
A young man and a young woman would be seen together constantly would fall in love would come to know each the other thoroughly
Then with the mind and character and looks and moods of each fully revealed to the other they would drift or fly in opposite directions wholly disillusioned
Occasionally they found that they were really congenial and either love remained or a cordial friendship sprang up
The modes of thought inconceivable to Europeans or Europeanized Americans made catastrophe all but impossible
It was through the girls that Scarborough got his invitation to the alcove table
There he came to know Pierson and to like him
One evening he went into Piersons roomsthe suite under Olivia and Paulines
He had never seenbut had dreamed ofsuch a luxurious bachelor interior
Piersons father had insisted that his son must go to the college where forty years before he had split wood and lighted fires and swept corridors to earn two years of higher education
Piersons mother defeated in her wish that her son should go East to college had tried to mitigate the rigors of Battle Fields primitive simplicity by herself fitting up his quarters
And she made them the showrooms of the college
Now lets see what can be done for you said Pierson with the superiority of a whole years experience where Scarborough was a beginner
Ill put you in the Sigma Alpha fraternity for one thing
Its the best here
I dont know anything about fraternities Scarborough said
What are they for
Oh everybody that is anybody belongs to a fraternity
There are about a dozen of them here and among them they get all the men with any claim to recognition
Just now we lean rather toward taking in the fellows whove been well brought up
Does everybody belong to a fraternity
Lord no
Twothirds dont belong
The fellows outside are called barbsthat is barbarians we on the inside are Greeks
Though I must say very few of us are Athenians and most of us are the rankest Macedonians
But the worst Greeks are better than the best barbs
Theyre the rummest lot of scrubs you ever sawstupid drudges who live round in all sorts of holes and dont amount to anything
The brush of the backwoods
Oh yesmmI see
Scarborough was looking uncomfortable
The Sigma Alphasll take you in next Saturday said Pierson
They do as I say between ourselves
Im ever so much obliged but Scarborough was red and began to stammer
You seeIit Whats the matter
Expense
Dont let that bother you
The costs nothing at all and the membership is absolutely necessary to your position
Yesa matter of expense
Scarborough was in control of himself now
But not precisely the kind of expense you mean
NoI cant join Id rather not explain
Im ever so much obliged but really I cant
As you please
Pierson was offended
But I warn you youve got to belong to one or the other of these fraternities or youll be cut off from everything
And you oughtnt to miss the chance to join the best
I see Ive offended you
Scarborough spoke regretfully
Please dont think Im not appreciating your kindness
ButIve made a sort of agreement with myself never to join anything that isnt organized for a general purpose and that wont admit anybody who has that purpose too
Pierson thought on this for a moment
Pardon me for saying so but thats nonsense
You cant afford to stand alone
Itll make everything harder for youmany things impossible
Youve got to yield to the prejudices of people in these matters
Why even the barbs have no use for each other and look up to us
When we have an election in the Literary Society I can control more barb votes than any one else in college
And the reason iswell you can imagine
Mr Pierson was only twenty years old when he made that speech
It doesnt disturb me to think of myself as alone
The strong lines in Scarboroughs face were in evidence
But it would disturb me if I were propped up and werent sure I could stand alone
Im afraid to lean on any one or anythingmy prop might give way
And I dont want any friends or any associates who value me for any other reason than what I myself am
I purpose never to belong to anything or anybody
Pierson laughed
Do as you please he said
Id like to myself if it wasnt such an awful lot of trouble
Not in the end replied Scarborough
Oh bother the end
Todays good enough for me
Youd better not let Miss Shrewsbury hear you say that said Scarborough his eyes mocking
Pierson grew serious at once
Splendid girl isnt she
She happened to be the first he had known at all well who hadnt agreed with him in everything he said hadnt shown the greatest anxiety to please him and hadnt practically thrown herself at his head
His combination of riches good looks an easygoing disposition and cleverness had so agitated those who had interested him theretofore that they had overreached themselves
Besides his mother had been subtly watchful
Indeed yes assented Scarborough heartily but not with enthusiasmhe always thought of Olivia as Paulines cousin
The four had arranged to go together to Indian Rock on the following Sunday
When the day came Olivia was not well Pierson went to a poker game at his fraternity house Pauline and Scarborough walked alone
As she went through the woods beside him she was thinking so intensely that she could not talk
But he was not disturbed by her silencewas it not enough to be near her alone with her free to look at her so graceful and beautiful so tasteful in dress in every outward way what he thought a woman ought to be
Presently she roused herself and began a remark that was obviously mere politeness
He interrupted her
Dont mind me
Go on with your thinkingunless its something you can say
She gave him a quizzical baffling smile
How it would startle you if I did
she said
ButI shant
Andshe frowned impatientlytheres no use in thinking about it
Its all in the future
And one cant control the future
Yes indeedone can she protested
I wish youd tell me how
Are you sure you dont mean you could so arrange matters that the future would control you
Anybody can SURRENDER to the future and give it hostages
But thats not controlling is it
Certainly it isif you give the hostages in exchange for what you want
And she looked triumphant
But how do you know what youll want in the future
The most I can say is that I know a few things I shant want
I shouldnt like to be of that disposition she said
But Im afraid you are whether you like it or not
Scarborough was halfserious half in jest
Are you the same person you were a month ago
Pauline glanced away
What do you mean
she asked
I mean in thoughtin feeling
Yesand no she replied presently when she had recovered from the shock of his chance knock at the very door of her secret
My coming here has made a sort of revolution in me already
I believe Ive a moremore grownup way of looking at things
And Ive been getting into the habit of thinkingandand actingfor myself
Thats a dangerous habit to formin a hurry said Scarborough
One oughtnt to try to swim a wide river just after hes had his first lesson in swimming
Pauline for no apparent reason flushed crimson and gave him a nervous lookit almost seemed a look of fright
But he went on we were talking of the change in you
If youve changed so much in thirty days or say in sixtyseven daysyouve been here that long I believethink of your whole life
The broader your mind and your life become the less certain youll be what sort of person tomorrow will find you
It seems to meI know that for myself Im determined to keep the future clear
Ill never tie myself to the past
But there are some things one MUST anchor fast to
Pauline was looking as if Scarborough were trying to turn her adrift in an open boat on a lonely sea
There arefriends
You wouldnt desert your friends would you
I couldnt help it if they insisted on deserting me
Id keep them if their way was mine
If it wasnttheyd give me up
But if you wereweremarried
Scarborough became intensely selfconscious
WellI dont knowthat is He paused went on I shouldnt marry until I was sureher way and mine were the same
The right sort of woman makes her husbands way hers said she
Does she
I dont know much about women
But it has always seemed to me that the kind of woman Id admire would be one who had her own ideals and ideas of lifeand thatifif she liked me it would be because we suited each other
You wouldnt want to belike those princesses that are brought up without any beliefs of any sort so that they can accept the beliefs of the kingdom of the man they happen to marry
Pauline laughed
I couldnt even if I wished she said
I should say not
he echoed as if the idea in connection with such an indelibly distinct young woman were preposterous
But you have such a queer way of expressing yourself
At first I thought you were talking of upsetting everything
I
Mercy no
Ive no idea of upsetting anything
Im only hoping I can help straighten a few things that have been tumbled over or turned upside down
Gradually as they walked and talked her own affairsDumonts and hersretreated to the background and she gave Scarborough her whole attention
Even in those dayshe was then twentythreehis personality usually dominated whomever he was with
It was not his size or appearance of strength it was not any compulsion of manner it was not even what he said or the way he said it
All of theseand his voice contributed but the real secret of his power was that subtile magnetic something which we try to fixand failwhen we say charm
He attracted Pauline chiefly because he had a way of noting the little thingsmatters of dress the flowers colors in the sky or the landscape the uncommon especially the amusing details of personalityand of connecting these trifles in unexpected ways with the large aspects of things
He saw the mystery of the universe in the contour of a leaf he saw the secret of a professors character in the way he had built out his whiskers to hide an absolute lack of chin and to give the impression that a formidable chin was there
He told her stories of life on his fathers farm that made her laugh other stories that made her feel like crying
Andhe brought out the best there was in her
She was presently talking of the things about which she had always been reticentthe real thoughts of her mind those she had suppressed because she had had no sympathetic listener those she looked forward to talking over with Dumont in that happy time when they would be together and would renew the intimacy interrupted since their High School days
When she burst in upon Olivia her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks glowing
The air was glorious she said and Mr Scarborough is SO interesting
And Olivia said to herself In spite of his tight clothes he may cure her of that worthless Dumont
VI
LIKE HIS FATHER
Scarborough soon lifted himself high above the throng and was marked by faculty and students as a man worth watching
The manner of this achievement was one of those forecasts of the future with which youth bristles for those who take the trouble to watch it
Although Pierson was only a sophomore he was the political as well as the social leader of his fraternity
Envy said that the Sigma Alphas truckled to his wealth perhaps the exacter truth was that his wealth forced an earlier recognition of his real capacity
His position as leader made him manager of the Sigma Alpha combination of fraternities and barbs which for six years had dominated the Washington and Jefferson Literary Society
The barbs had always voted humbly with the aristocratic Sigma Alphas so Piersons political leadership apparently had no onerous duties attached to itand he was not the man to make work for himself
As the annual election approached he heard rumors of barb disaffection of threatened barb revolt
Vance his barb lieutenant reassured him
Always a few kickers said Vance and they make a lot of noise
But they wont draw off twenty votes
Pierson made himself easythere was no danger of one of those hardfought contests which in past years had developed at Battle Field many of Indianas adroit political leaders
On election night he felt important and powerful as he sat in the front row among the arrogant Sigma Alphas at the head of his forces massed in the left side of the hall
He had insisted on Scarboroughs occupying a seat just behind him
He tilted back in his armchair and said in an undertone Youre voting with us
Scarborough shook his head
Cant do it
Im pledged to Adee
Pierson looked amused
Whos he
And whos putting him up
Im nominating him replied Scarborough as the barb candidate
Take my advice dont do it old man said Pierson in a friendly somewhat patronizing tone
Youll only get our fellows down on youthem and all the fraternity men
Andwell your candidatell have a dozen votes or so at mostand therell be a laugh
YesI suppose there will be a laugh said Scarborough his eyes twinkling
Dont do it urged Pierson
Be practical
NoI leave that to your people
Just then nominations for president were called for and the candidates of the two factions were proposed and seconded
The nominations for president are began the chairman but before he could utter the word closed Scarborough was on his feetwas saying Mr
Chairman
Pierson dropped his eyes and grew red with embarrassment for his friend who was thus rushing on to make a fool of himself
Scarboroughs glance traveled slowly from row to row of expectant young men
Mr Chairman and fellowmembers of the Washington and Jefferson Society he said in a conversational tone
I have the honor of placing in nomination Frank Adee of Terre Haute
In addition to other qualifications of which it would be superfluous for me to speak in this presence he represents the masses of the membership of this society which has been too long dominated by and for its classes
It is time to compel the fraternities to take faction and caste and political wirepulling away from this hall and to keep them away
It is time to rededicate our society to equality to freedom of thought and speech to the democratic ideas of the plain yet proud builders of this college of ours
Scarborough made no attempt at oratory made not a single gesture
It was as though he were talking privately and earnestly with each one there
He sat amid silence when a few barbs nervously applauded the fraternity men of both factions recovering themselves raised a succession of ironical cheers
A shabby frightened barb stood awkwardly and in a trembling weak voice seconded the nomination
There was an outburst of barb applausestrong defiant
Pierson was anxiously studying the faces of his barbs
By Jove he muttered Vance has been caught napping
I believe Scarborough has put up a job on us
If I cant gain time were beat
And he sprang to his feet his face white
In a voice which he struggled in vain to keep to his wonted affected indifferent drawl he said Mr Chairman I move you sir that we adjourn
As he was bending to sit his ready lieutenant seconded the motion
Mr
Chairman
It was an excited voice from the rear of the hallthe voice of a tall lank sallow man of perhaps thirtyfive
What right he shouted shrilly has this Mr Pierson to come here and make that there motion
He aint never seen here except on election nights
He The chairman rapped sharply
Motion to adjourn not debatable he said and then mumbled rapidly The questions the motion to adjourn
All in favor say Ayeall opposed Nothe ayes seem to have itthe ayes have Mr Chairman I call for a count of the ayes and noes
It was Scarborough standing completely selfpossessed
His voice was not raised but it vibrated through that room vibrated through those three hundred intensely excited young men
The chairmanWaller a Zeta Rho of the Sigma Alpha combinationknew that Pierson was scowling a command to him to override the rules and adjourn the meeting but he could not take his eyes from Scarboroughs dared not disobey Scarboroughs imperious look
A count of the ayes and noes is called for he said
The secretary will call the roll
Piersons motion was lostone hundred and thirtytwo to one hundred and seventynine
For the first time in his life he was beaten and it was an overwhelming a public defeat that made his leadership ridiculous
His vanity was cut savagely it was impossible for him to control himself to stay and witness the inevitable rout
He lounged down the wide aisle his face masked in a supercilious smile his glance contemptuously upon the jubilant barbs
They were thick about the doors and as he passed among them he said addressing no one in particular A revolt of the Helots
A barb raised a threatening fist Pierson sneered and the fist unclenched and dropped before his fearless eyes
An hour later Scarborough his ticket elected and the society adjourned reached Mrs Trents porch
In its darkness he saw the glowing end of a cigarette
That you Pierson
he asked in the tone of one who knows what the answer will be
Sit down for a few minutes came the reply in a strained voice
He could not see even the outline of Piersons face but with those acute sensibilities which made life alternately a keen pleasure and a pain to him he felt that his friend was struggling for selfcontrol
He waited in silence
At last Pierson began I owe you an apology
Ive been thinking all sorts of things about you
I know theyre unjust andmean which is worse
But damn it Scarborough I HATE being beaten
And it doesnt make defeat any the easier because YOU did it
He paused but Scarborough did not speak
Im going to be frank Pierson went on with an effort
I know you had a perfect right to do as you pleased buthang it all old manyou might have warned me
But I didnt do as I pleased said Scarborough
And as for telling you He paused before he interrupted himself with But first I want to say that I dont like to give an account of myself to my friends
What does friendship mean if it forbids freedom
I didnt approve or condemn you because you belonged to a fraternity and because you headed a clique that was destroying the Literary Society by making it a place for petty fraternity politics instead of a place to develop speakers writers and debaters
Yet now youre bringing me to account because I didnt slavishly accept your ideas as my own
Do you think thats a sound basis for a friendship Pierson
When Scarborough began Pierson was full of a grievance which he thought real and deep
He was proposing to forgive Scarborough forgive him generously but not without making him realize that it was an act of generosity
As Scarborough talked he was first irritated then and suddenly convinced that he was himself in the wrongin the wrong throughout
Dont say another word Scarborough he replied impulsively laying his hand on the arm of his friendhow powerful it felt through the sleeve
Ive been spoiled by always having my own way and by people letting me rule them
You gave me my first lesson in defeat
AndI needed it badly
As for your not telling me youd have ruined your scheme if you had
Besides looking back I see that you did warn me
I know now what you meant by always jumping on the fraternities and the combinations
Thank you said Scarborough simply
When I saw you leaving the society hall I feared Id lost a friend
Instead Ive found what a friend I have
Then after a brief silence he continued This little incident up there tonightthis little revolution I took part inhas meant a good deal to me
It was the first chance Id had to carry out the ideas Ive thought over and thought over down there on the farm while I was working in the fields or lying in the hay staring up at the sky
And I dont suppose in all the future Ill ever have a greater temptation to be false to myself than I had in the dread thats been haunting methe dread of losing your friendshipand the friendship ofofsome others who might see it as I was afraid you would
There may be lessons in this incident for you Fred
But the greatest lesson of all is the one youve taught meNEVER to be afraid to go forward when the Finger points
Pierson and Olivia walked to chapel together the next morning and he told her the story of the defeat putting himself in a worse light than he deserved
But Olivia who never lost a chance to attack him for his shortcomings now to his amazement burst out against Scarborough
It was contemptible she said hotly
It was treachery
It was a piece of coldblooded ambition
Hed sacrifice anything any one to ambition
I shall never like him again
Pierson was puzzledbeing in love with her he had been deceived by her pretense that she had a poor opinion of him and he did not appreciate that her sense of justice was now clouded by resentment for his sake
At dinner when the four were together she attacked Scarborough
Though she did not confess it he forced her to see that at least his motives were not those she had been attributing to him
When he and Pauline were aloneOlivia and Pierson had to hurry away to a lecture he said What do YOU think Miss Gardiner
Youdid youdo youagree with your cousin
I
Pauline dropped her eyes
Oh I She hesitated so long that he said Go ontell me just what you think
Id rather know than suspect
I think you did right
ButI dont see how you had the courage to do it
That is you think I did rightbut the sort of right thats worse than wrong
Nono
she protested putting a good deal of feeling into her voice in the effort to reassure him
Id have been ashamed of you if you hadnt done it
Andoh I despise weakness in a man most of all
And I like to think that if everybody in college had denounced you youd have gone straight on
Andyou WOULD
Within a week after this they were calling each the other by their first names
For the Christmas holidays she went with her mother from Battle Field direct to Chicago to her fathers sisters Mrs HaydenColonel Gardiner had been called south on business
When she came back she and Scarborough took up their friendship where they had left it
They read the same books had similar tastes disagreed sympathetically agreed with enthusiasm
She saw a great deal of several other men in her class enough not to make her preference for him significant to the collegeor to herself
They went for moonlight strawrides on moonlight and starlight skating and iceboat parties for long walks over the hillsall invariably with others but they were often practically alone
He rapidly dropped his rural manners and mannerismsFred Piersons tailor in Indianapolis made the most radical of the surface changes in him
Late in February his cousin the superintendent of the farm telegraphed him to come home
He found his mother illplainly dying
And his fatherBladen Scarboroughs boast had been that he never took a dose of drugs in his life and for at least seventy of his seventynine years he had been on the jump daily from long before dawn until long after sundown
Now he was content to sit in his armchair and with no more vigorous protest than a frown and a growl to swallow the despised drugs
Each day he made them carry him in his great chair into HER bedroom
And there he sat all day long his shaggy brows down his gaze rarely wandering from the little ridge her small body made in the high white bed and in his stern eyes there was a look of stoic anguish
Each night as they were carrying him to his own room they took him near the bed and he leaned forward and the voice that in all their years had never been anything but gentle for her said Good night Sallie
And the small form would move slightly there would be a feeble turning of the head a wan smile on the little old face a soft Good night Bladen
It was on Hampdens ninth day at home that the old man said Good night Sallie and there was no answernot even a stir
They did not offer to carry him in the next morning nor did he turn his face from the wall
She died that day he three days laterhe had refused food and medicine he had not shed a tear or made a sound
Thus the journey side by side for fiftyone years was a journey no longer
They were asleep side by side on the hillside for ever
Hampden stayed at home only one day after the funeral
He came back to Battle Field apparently unchanged
He was not in black for Bladen Scarborough abhorred mourning as he abhorred all outward symbols of the things of the heart
But after a week he told Pauline about it and as he talked she sobbed though his voice did not break nor his eyes dim
Hes like his father she thought
When Olivia believed that Dumont was safely forgotten she teased herYour adoring and adored Scarborough
Pauline was amused by this
With his unfailing instinct Scarborough had feltand had never permitted himself to forgetthat there was some sort of wall round her for him
It was in perfect good faith that she answered Olivia You dont understand him
Hes a queer mansometimes I wonder myself that he doesnt get just a little sentimental
I suppose Id find him exasperatingif I werent otherwise engaged
Olivia tried not to show irritation at this reference to Dumont
I think youre mistaken about which of you is queer she said
You are the onenot he
I
Pauline laughedshe was thinking of her charm against any love but one mans the wedding ring she always wore at her neck
Why I COULDNT fall in love with HIM
The woman who gets him will do mighty well for herselfin every way said Olivia
Indeed she will
ButId as soon think of falling in love with a tree or a mountain
She liked her phrase it seemed to her exactly to define her feeling for Scarborough
She liked it so well that she repeated it to herself reassuringly many times in the next few weeks
VII
PAULINE AWAKENS
In the last week of March came a succession of warm rains
The leaves burst from their impatient hiding just within the cracks in the gray bark
And on Monday the unclouded sun was irradiating a pale green world from a pale blue sky
The four windows of Pauline and Olivias sittingroom were up a warm scented wind was blowing this way and that the strays of Paulines redbrown hair as she sat at the table her eyes on a book her thoughts on a letterDumonts first letter on landing in America
A knock and she frowned slightly
Come
she cried her expression slowly veering toward welcome
The door swung back and in came Scarborough
Not the awkward youth of last October but still unable wholly to conceal how much at a disadvantage he felt before the woman he particularly wished to please
YesIm ten minutes early he said apology in his tone for his instinct told him that he was interrupting and he had too little vanity to see that the interruption was agreeable
But I thought youd be only reading a novel
For answer she held up the book which lay before hera solemn volume in light brown calf
Analytical geometry he said and on the first day of the finest spring the world ever saw
He was at the window looking out longinglysunshine and soft air washed clean by the rains the newborn leaves and buds the pioneer birds and flowers
Lets go for a walk
We can do the Vergil tonight
YOUtalking of neglecting WORK
Her smile seemed to him to sparkle as much in the waves of her hair as in her even white teeth and goldbrown eyes
So youre human just like the rest of us
Human
He glanced at her and instantly glanced away
Do leave that window she begged
We must get the Vergil now
Im reading an essay at the society tonighttheyve fined me twice for neglecting it
But if you stand there reminding me of whats going on outside Ill not be able to resist
How this would look from Indian Rock
She flung open a Vergil textbook with a relentless shake of the head
Ive got the place
Book three line two fortyfive Una in praecelsa consedit rupe Celaeno  It doesnt matter what that hideous old Harpy howled at the pious Aeneas he grumbled
Lets go out and watch the Great God Pan dedicate his brandnew temple
Do sit there
She pointed a slim white forefinger at the chair at the opposite side of the tablethe side nearer him
Ill be generous and work the dictionary today
And she opened a fat black dulllooking book beside the Vergil
Wheres the Johnnie
he asked reluctantly dropping into the chair
She laid Drydens translation of the Aeneid on his side of the table
They always read the poetical version before they began to translate for the classroomDryden was near enough to the original to give them its spirit far enough to quiet their consciences
Find the place yourself said she
Im not going to do everything
He opened the Dryden and languidly turned the pages
At length rebuffd they leave their mangled  he began
Notwo or three lines farther down she interrupted
That was in the last lesson
He pushed back the rebellious lock that insisted on falling down the middle of his forehead plunged his elbows fiercely upon the table put his fists against his temples and began again High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate And thus her dismal errand did relate Have you got the place in the Latin
he interrupted himself
Fortunately he did not look up for she was watching the waving boughs
Yes she replied hastily returning to the book
You do your part and Ill do mine
He read a few lines in an absentminded singsong then interrupted himself once more Did you ever smell anything like that breeze
Never
Bellum etiam pro caede bovumgo onIm listeningor trying to
He read But know that ere your promised walls you build My curse shall severely be fulfilled
Fierce famine is your lotfor this misdeed Reduced to grind the plates on which you feed
 He glanced at her
She was leaning on her elbow obviously weaving daydreams round those boughs as they trembled with the ecstasy of spring
You are happy today
he said
Yeshappier than I have been for a year
She smiled mysteriously
Ive had good news
She turned abruptly looked him in the eyes with that frank clear expressionhis favorite among his memorypictures of her had it
Theres one thing that worries meits never off my mind longer than a few minutes
And when Im blue as I usually am on rainy days it makes mehorribly uncomfortable
Ive often almost asked your advice about it
If youd be sorry afterward that you told me said he I hope you wont
But if I can help you you know how glad Id be
Its no use to tell Olivia Pauline went on
Shes bitterly prejudiced
But ever since the first month I knew you I felt that I could trust you that you were a real friend
And youre so fair in judging people and things
His eyes twinkled
Im afraid Id tilt the scalesjust a littlewhere you were concerned
Oh I want you to do that she answered with a smile
Last fall I did somethingwell it was foolish though I wouldnt admit that to any one else
I was carried away by an impulse
Not that I regret
In the only really important way I wouldnt undo it if I couldI think
Those last two words came absently as if she were debating the matter with herself
If its done and cant be undone he said cheerfully I dont see that advice is needed
Butyou dont understand
She seemed to be casting about for words
As I said it was last fallhere
In Saint X there was a manand he and Iwed cared for each other ever since we were children
And then he went away to college
He did several things father didnt like
You know how older people arethey dont make allowances
And though fathers the gentlest bestat any rate he turned against Jack and Scarborough abruptly went to the window and stood with his back to her
After a pause Pauline said in a rush And he came here last fall and we got married
There was a long silence
It was DREADFUL wasnt it
she said in the tone of one who has just made a shocking discovery
Scarborough did not answer
I never realized till this minute she went on after a while
Not that Im sorry or that I dontdont CAREjust as I always did
But somehow telling it out loud to some one else has made me see it in a different light
It didnt seem like treachery to themto father and motherthen
It hasnt seemed like aa marriage REALLY marriageuntil now
Another long silence
Then she burst out appealingly Oh I dont see how Im ever going to tell them
Scarborough came back to his chair and seated himself
His face was curiously white
It was in an unnatural voice that he said How old is he
Twentyfive she replied then instantly flared up as if he had attacked Dumont But it wasnt his faultnot in the least
I knew what I was doingand I wanted to do it
You mustnt get a false impression of him Hampden
Youd admire and respect him
Youany onewould have done as he did in the same circumstances
She blushed slightly
You and he are ever so much alikeeven in looks
It was that that made me tell you that made me like you as I haveand trust you
Scarborough winced
Presently he began Yet you regret Nono
she protestedtoo vehemently
I do NOT regret marrying him
That was certain to be sooner or later
All I regret is that I did something that seems underhanded
Perhaps Im really only sorry I didnt tell them as soon as Id done it
She waited until she saw he was not going to speak
And now she said I dont know HOW to tell them
Again she waited but he did not speak continued to look steadily out into the sky
What do you think
she asked nervously
But I can see without your saying
Only Iwish youd SAY it
No I dont condemn you he said slowly
I know you
YOU couldnt possibly do anything underhanded
If youd been where youd have had to conceal it directly face to face from some one who had the right to knowyoud never have done it
He rested his arms on the table and looked straight at her
I feel I must tell you what I think
And I feel too it wouldnt be fair and honest if I didnt let you see why you might not want to take my advice
She returned his gaze inquiringly
I love you he went on calmly
Ive known it ever since I missed you so at the Christmas holidays
I love you for what you are and for what youre as certain to be asas a rosebud is certain to be a fullblown rose
I love you as my father loved my mother
I shall love you always
His manner was calm matteroffact but there was in his musical magical voice a certain quality which set her nerves and her blood suddenly to vibrating
She felt as if she were struggling in a great seathe sea of his love for herstruggling to reach the safety of the shore
OhI WISH you hadnt told me
she exclaimed
Suppose I hadnt suppose you had taken my advice
Nohe shook his head slowlyI couldnt do that Paulinenot even to win you
Im sorry I said anything to you about it
You neednt be
You havent harmed yourself
And maybe I can help you
Nowe wont talk of it she saidshe was pressing her hand on her bosom where she could feel her wedding ring
It wouldnt be right now
I dont wish your advice
But I must give it
Im years and years older than youmany many years more than the six between us
And I dont wish to hear
For his sake for your own sake Pauline tell them
And theyll surely help you to wait till youre older before you do anythingirrevocable
But I care for him she saidangrily though it could not have been what he was saying so gently that angered her
You forget that I care for him
It IS irrevocable now
And Im glad it is
You LIKE him
You dont LOVE him
Andhes not worthy of your love
Im sure it isnt prejudice that makes me say it
If he were hed have waited She was on her feet her eyes blazing
I asked for advice not a lecture
I DESPISE you
Attacking the man I love and behind his back
I wish to be alone
He rose but met her look without flinching
You can send ME away he said gently but you cant send away my words
And if theyre true youll feel them when you get over your anger
Youll do what you think right
Butbe SURE Pauline
Be SURE
In his eyes there was a lookthe secret altar with the nevertobeextinguished flame upon it
Be SURE Pauline
Be SURE
Her anger fell she sank forlorn into a chair
For both the day had shriveled and shadowed
And as he turned and left the room the warmth and joy died from air and sky and earth both of them felt the latent chillit seemed not a reminiscence of winter past but the icy foreboding of winter closing in
When Olivia came back that evening from shopping in Indianapolis she found her cousin packing
Is it something from home
she asked alarmed
Pauline did not look up as she answered Nobut Im going hometo staygoing in the morning
Ive telegraphed them
To stay
YesI was married to Jackherelast fall
Youmarried
To JOHN DUMONTyou only seventeenoh Pauline And Olivia gave way to tears for the first time since she was a baby
Scarborough was neither at supper nor at breakfastPauline left without seeing him again
VIII
THE DECISION
When the signboard on a station platform said 52 miles to St X Pauline sank back in her chair in the parlorcar with blanched face
And almost immediately so it seemed to her Saint X came into viewhome
She fancied she could see the very house as she looked down on the mass of green in which the town was embowered
The train slid into the station slowed downthere were people waiting on the platformher father
He was glancing from window to window trying to catch a glimpse of her and his expression of almost agonized eagerness made her heartsick
She had been away from him for nearly seven monthslong enough to break the habit which makes it impossible for members of a family to know how they really look to each other
How gray and thin his beard seemed
What was the meaning of that gaunt look about his shoulders
What was the strange terrifying shadow over him
Why hes OLD
The tears welled into her eyesHes gliding away from me
She remembered what she had to tell him and her knees almost refused to support her
He was at the step as she sprang down
She flew into his arms
He held her away from him and scanned her face with anxious eyes
Is my little girl ill
he asked
The telegram made me uneasy
Oh no
she said with a reassuring hug
Wheres mother
Sheshes got aasurprise for you
We must hurryshell be impatient though shes seen you since I have
At the curbstone stood the familiar surrey with Mordecai humped upon the front seat
I dont see how the colonel ever knowed you said he as she shook hands with him
I never seen the like for growin
But YOU look just the same Mordecaiyou and the surrey and the horses
And hows Amanda
Poorly replied Mordecaihis invariable answer to inquiries about his wife
She patterned after the old school which held that for a woman to confess to good health was for her to confess to lack of refinement if not of delicacy
You think Ive changed father
asked Pauline when the horses were whirling them home
She was so busily greeting the familiar streets and houses and trees and faces that she hardly heard his reply
I never seen the like for growin  he quoted his eyes shining with pride in her
He was a reticent man by nature as well as by training he could not have SAID how beautiful how wonderful he thought her or how intensely he loved her
The most he could do to express himself to her was a little shyly to pat her handand to LOOK it into Mordecais back
She was about to snuggle up to him as a wave of delight at being home again swept over her but her secret rushed from the background of her mind
How could I have done it
How can I tell them
Then the serene and beautiful kindness of her fathers face reassured her
Her mother was waiting in the open front door as the surrey came up the drivestill the same dear oldyoung mother with the same sweet dignity and gentleness
Oh mother mother
exclaimed Pauline leaping from the carriage into her arms
And as they closed about her she felt that sorrow and evil could not touch her felt just as when she a little girl fleeing from some frightful phantom of her own imagining had rushed there for safety
She choked she sobbed she led her mother to the big sofa opposite the stairway and sitting there they held each the other tightly Pauline kissing her smoothing her hair she caressing Pauline and crying softly
Weve got a surprise for you Polly said she when they were calmer
I dont want anything but you and father replied Pauline
Her father turned awayand so she did not see the shadow deepen in his face
Her mother shook her head mischief in her eyes that were young as a girlsyounger far than her daughters at that moment
Go into the sittingroom and see she said
Pauline opened the sittingroom door
John Dumont caught her in his arms
Polly
he exclaimed
Its all right
Theyve come round andandhere I am
Pauline pushed him away from her and sank to the floor in a faint
When she came to herself she was lying on the divan in the sittingroom
Her mother was kneeling beside her bathing her temples with cold water her father and her husband were standing helplessly looking at her
Send him away she murmured closing her eyes
Only her mother heard
She motioned to the two men to leave the room
When the door closed Pauline sat up
He said it was all right she began feverishly
What did he mean mother
She was hoping she was to be spared the worst part of her ordeal
But her mothers reply dashed her hopes made her settle back among the cushions and hide her face
It IS all right Polly
Youre to have your own way and its your fathers way
John has convinced him that he really has changed
We knewthat is I suspected why you were coming and we thought wed give you a surprisegive you what your heart was set on before you had to ask for it
Im so sorry dear that the shock was Pauline lay perfectly still her face hidden
After a pause I dont feel well enough to see him now
I want this day with you and father
Tomorrowtomorrow welltoday I want to be as I was when I wasjust you and father and the house and the garden
Her mother left her for a moment and when she came back said Hes gone
Pauline gave a quick sigh of relief
Soon she rose
Im going for father and well walk in the garden and forget theres anybody else in the world but just us three
At halfpast eight they had family prayers in the sittingroom Pauline kneeling near her mother her father kneeling beside his armchair and in a tremulous voice pouring out his gratitude to God for keeping them all safe from the snares and temptations of the world for leading them thus far on the journey
And God our Father we pray Thee have this daughter of ours this handmaiden of Thine ever in Thy keeping
And these things we ask in the name of Thy SonAmen
The serene quiet the beloved old room the evening scene familiar to her from her earliest childhood her fathers reverent earnest voice halting and almost breaking after every word of the petition for her her mothers soft echo of his AmenPaulines eyes were swimming as she rose from her knees
Her mother went with her to her bedroom hovered about her as she undressed helped her now and then with fingers that trembled with happiness and when she was in bed put out the light and tucked her in and kissed heras in the old days
Good nightGod bless my little daughtermy HAPPY little daughter
Pauline waited until she knew that they were sleeping
Then she put on a dressinggown and went to the open windowhow many springtimes had she sat there in the moonlight to watch as now the tulips and the hyacinths standing like fairies and bombarding the stars with the most delicious perfumes
She sat hour after hour giving no outward sign of battle within
In every lull came Scarboroughs Be SURE Pauline
to start the tumult afresh
When the stars began to pale in the dawn she roseshe WAS sure
Far from sure that she was doing the best for herself but sure sure without a doubt that she was doing her duty to her parents
I must not punish THEM for MY sin she said
Late the next morning she went to the farthest corner of the garden to the small summerhouse where she had played with her dolls and her dishes where she had worked with slate and spellingbook where she had read her favorite schoolgirl romances where she had dreamed her own schoolgirl romance
She was waiting under the friendly old canopy of barkthe posts supporting it were barkclad too up and around and between them clambered the morningglories in whose gorgeous velvetsoft trumpets the sunjewels glittered
And presently he came down the path his keen face and insolent eyes triumphant
He was too absorbed in his own emotion especially to note hers
Besides she had always been receptive rather than demonstrative with him
Well be married again and do the gossips out of a sensation he said
Though she was not looking at him his eyes shifted from her face as he added in a voice which at another time she might have thought strained Then too your father and mother and mine are so straitlaceditd give em a terrible jar to find out
Youre a good deal like them Pollyonly in a modern sort of way
Pauline flushed scarlet and compressed her lips
She said presently Youre sure you wish it
Wish what
To marry me
Sometimes Ive thought were both too young that we might wait He put his arm round her with an air of proud possession
Whatd be the sense in that
he demanded gaily
Arent you MINE
And again she flushed and lowered her eyes and compressed her lips
Then she astonished him by flinging her arms round his neck and kissing him hysterically
But I DO love you
she exclaimed
I do
I DO
IX
A THOROUGHBRED RUNS AWAY
It was midday six weeks later and Pauline and Dumont were landing at Liverpool when Scarborough read in the collegenews column of the Battle Field Banner that she had married the only son of Henry Dumont of Saint Christopher one of the richest men in our state and has departed for an extended foreign tour
Oliviaand Pierson naturallyhad known but neither had had the courage to tell him
Scarborough was in Piersons room
He lowered the paper from in front of his face after a few minutes
I see Pauline has married and gone abroad he said
Yes so I heard from Olivia replied Pierson avoiding Scarboroughs eyes
Why didnt you tell me
continued Scarborough tranquil so far as Pierson could judge
Id have liked to send her a note
Pierson was silent
I thought it would cut him horribly he was thinking
And hes taking it as if he had only a friendly interest
Scarboroughs face was again behind the newspaper
When he had finished it he sauntered toward the door
He paused there to glance idly at the titles of the top row in the bookcase
Pierson was watching him
Noits all right he concluded
Scarborough was too straight and calm just to have received such a blow as that news would have been had HE cared for Pauline
Pierson liked his look better than ever beforethe tall powerful figure the fair hair growing above his wide and lofty brow with the one defiant lock and in his aquiline nose and bluegray eyes and almost perfect mouth and chin the stamp of one who would move forward irresistibly moving others to his will
How old are you Scarborough
he asked
Twentythreenearly twentyfour
I ought to be ashamed to be only a freshman oughtnt I
He shrugged his shoulders
Im tired of it all
And he strolled out
He avoided Pierson and Olivia and all his friends for several days went much into the woods alone took long walks at night
Olivia would have it that he had been hard hit and almost convinced Pierson
Hes the sort of person that suffers the most she said
Ive a brother like himwont have sympathy keeps a wound covered up so that it cant heal
But what shall I do for him
asked Pierson
Dont do anythinghed hate you if you did
After a week or ten days he called on Pierson and seating himself at the table began to shuffle a pack of cards
He looked tired
I never saw cards until I was fifteen he said
At home they thought them one of the devils worst deviceswe had a real devil in our house
So did we said Pierson
But not a ripsnorter like oursthey dont have him in cities or even in towns any more
Ive seen ours lots of times after the lights were outsaw him long after Id convinced myself in daylight that he didnt exist
But I never saw him so close as the night of the day I learned to play casino
Did you learn in the stable
asked Pierson
Thats where I learned and mother slipped up behind meI didnt know what was coming till I saw the look in the other boys face
Then Pierson left the rest to imagination
I learned in the hayloftmy sister and my cousin Ed and I
One of the farmhands taught us
The cards were so stained we could hardly see the faces
That made them look the more devilish
And a thunderstorm came up and the lightning struck a tree a few rods from the barn
Horrible
exclaimed Pierson
Ill bet you fell to praying
Not I Id just finished Tom Paines Age of Reasona preachers son down the pike stole it from a locked closet in his fathers library and loaned it to me
But Ill admit the thunderbolt staggered me
I said to thempretty shakily I guess Come on lets begin again
But the farmhand said I reckon Ill get on the safe side and began to prayhow he roared
And I laughedhow wicked and reckless and brave that laugh did sound to me
Bella and Ed didnt know which to be more afraid ofmy ridicule or the lightning
They compromisedthey didnt pray and they didnt play
And so youve never touched a card since
We played again the next afternoonlets have a game of poker
Im bored to death today
This was Scarboroughs first move toward the fast set of which Pierson was leader
It was a small fast setthere were not many spoiled sons at Battle Field
But its pace was rapid for every member of it had a constitution that was a huge reservoir of animal spirits and western energy
They cribbed their way through recitations and examinationsas the faculty did not put the students on honor but watched them they reasoned that cribbing was not dishonorable provided one did barely enough of it to pull him through
They drank a great dealusually whisky which they disliked but poured down raw because it was the manly drink and to take it undiluted was the manly way
They made brief excursions to Indianapolis and Chicago for the sort of carousals that appeal to the strong appetites and undiscriminating tastes of robust and curious youth
Scarborough at once began to reap the reward of his advantagesa naturally bold spirit an unnaturally reckless mood
In two weeks he won three hundred dollars half of it from Pierson
He went to Chicago and in three nights play increased this to twentynine hundred
The noise of the unprecedented achievement echoed through the college
In its constellation of bad examples a new star had blazed out a star of the first magnitude
Bladen Scarborough had used his surplus to improve and extend his original farm
But farms were now practically unsalable and Hampden and Arabella were glad to let their cousin EdEd Warfieldstay on rent free because with him there they were certain that the place would be well kept up
Hampden poor in cash had intended to spend the summer as a book agent
Instead he put by a thousand dollars of his winnings to insure next years expenses and visited Pierson at his familys cottage in the summer colony at Mackinac
He won at poker there and went on East taking Pierson
He lost all he had with him all Pierson could lend him telegraphed to Battle Field for half his thousand dollars won back all he had lost and two thousand besides
When he reappeared at Battle Field in September he was dazzling to behold
His clothes were many and had been imported for him by the Chicago agent of a London tailor
His shirts and ties were in patterns and styles that startled Battle Field
He had taken on manners and personal habits befitting a man of the worldbut he had not lost that simplicity and directness which were as unchangeably a part of him as the outlines of his face or the force which forbade him to be idle for a moment
He and PiersonPierson was pupil nowtook a suite of rooms over a shop in the town and furnished them luxuriously
They had brought from New York to look after them and their belongings the first English manservant Battle Field had seen
Scarborough kept up his college work he continued regularly to attend the Literary Society and to be its most promising orator and debater he committed no overt actothers might break the college rules might be publicly intoxicated and noisy but he was always master of himself and of the situation
Some of the fanatical among the religious students believed and said that he had sold himself to the devil
He would have been expelled summarily but for PiersonPiersons father was one of the two large contributors to the support of the college and it was expected that he would will it a generous endowment
To entrap Scarborough was to entrap Pierson
To entrap Pierson The faculty strove to hear and see as little as possible of their doings
In the college YMCA
prayers were offered for Scarboroughhis name was not spoken but every one understood
A delegation of the religious among his faithful fellow barbs called upon him to pray and to exhort
They came away more charmed than ever with their champion and convinced that he was the victim of slander and envy
Not that he had deliberately deceived them for he hadnt he was simply courteous and respectful of their sincerity
The fraternities are in this somewhere the barbs decided
Theyre trying to destroy him by lying about him
And they liked it that their leader was the brilliant the talkedabout the soughtafter person in the college
When he stood up to speak in the assembly hall or the Literary Society they always greeted him with several rounds of applause
To the chagrin of the faculty and the irritation of the fraternities a jury of alumni selected him to represent Battle Field at the oratorical contest among the colleges of the state
And he not only won there but also at the interstate contesta victory over the orators of the colleges of seven western states in which public speaking was and is an essential part of higher education
His oratory lacked style they thought at Battle Field
It was the same then essentially as it was a few years later when the whole western country was discussing it
He seemed to depend entirely upon the inherent carrying power of his ably constructed sentenceslike so many arrows some flying gracefully others straight and swift all reaching the mark at which they were aimed
In those days as afterward he stood upon the platform almost motionless his voice was clear and sweet never noisy but subtly penetrating and when the sense demanded it full of that mysterious quality which makes the blood run more swiftly and the nerves tingle
Merely a talker not an orator declared the professor of elocution and few of those who saw him every day appreciated his genius then
It was on the subjectmatter of his oration not on his delivery that the judges decided for himso they said and thought
In February of this resplendent sophomore year there came in his mail a letter postmarked Battle Field and addressed in printed handwriting
The envelope contained only a newspaper cuttingfrom the St Christopher Republic At four oclock yesterday afternoon a boy was born to Mr and Mrs John Dumont
It is their first child the first grandchild of the Dumont and Gardiner families
Mother and son are reported as doing well
Scarborough spent little time in the futile effort to guess what coward enemy had sped this anonymous shaft on the chance of its hitting him
His only enemies that interested him were those within himself
He destroyed envelope and clipping then said to Pierson I neglected to celebrate an important event not long ago
He paused to laughso queerly that Pierson looked at him uneasily
We must go to Chicago to celebrate it
Very good said Fred
Well get Chalmers to go with us tomorrow
Notodaythe fouroclock trainweve got an hour and a half
And well have four clear days
But theres the ball tonight and Im down for several dances
Well dance them in Chicago
Ive never been really free to dance before
He poured out a huge drink
Im impatient for the ball to begin
He lifted his glass
To our ancestors he said who repressed themselves denied themselves who hoarded health and strength and capacity for joy and transmitted them in great oceans to usto drown our sorrows in
He won six hundred dollars at faro in a club not far from the Auditorium Pierson won two hundred at roulette Chalmers lost seventythey had about fourteen hundred dollars for their four days dance
When they took the train for Battle Field they had spent all they had with themhad flung it away for dinners for drives for theaters for suppers for champagne
All the return journey Scarborough stared moodily out of the car window
And at every movement that disturbed his clothing there rose to nauseate him to fill him with selfloathing the odors of strong sickeningsweet perfumes
The next day but one as he was in the woods near Indian Rock he saw Olivia coming toward him
They had hardly spoken for several months
He turned to avoid her but she came on after him
I wish to talk with you a few minutes Mr Scarborough she said coldly storm in her brave eyes
At your service he answered with strained courtesy
And he walked beside her
I happen to know she began that theyre going to expel you and Fred Pierson the next time you leave here without permission
Indeed
You are very kind to warn me of my awful danger
He looked down at her with a quizzical smile
And I wish to say I think its a disgrace that they didnt do it long ago she went on her anger rising to the bait of his expression
Your opinions are always interesting he replied
If you have nothing further Ill ask your permission to relieve you of No she interrupted
Ive not said what I wished to say
Youre making it hard for me
I cant get accustomed to the change in you since last year
There used to be a good side to you a side one could appeal to
And I want to talk aboutFred
Youre RUINING him
You flatter me
He bowed mockingly
But I doubt if HED feel flattered
Ive told him the same thing but youre too strong for me
Her voice trembled she steadied it with a frown
I cant influence him any longer
Really Miss Shrewsbury Please
she said
Fred and I were engaged
I broke it last night
I broke it becauseyou know why
Scarborough flushed crimson
Oh he said
I didnt know he was engaged
I know you Hampden Scarborough Olivia continued
Ive understood why youve been degrading yourself
And I havent blamed youthough Ive wondered at your lack of manhood
You are imposing on my courtesy he said haughtily
I cant help it
You and I must talk this thing to the end
Youre robbing me of the man I love
Worse than that youre destroying him dragging him down to a level at which HE may stay while YOU are sure to rise again
Youve got your living to makeI dont agree with those who think youll become a professional gambler
But he his fathers rich and indulgent andGod only knows how low hell sink if you keep on pushing him
You are excited hysterical
You misjudge him believe me said Scarborough gently
NoI know hes not depravedyet
Do you think I could care for him if he were
I hope so
Thats when hed need it most
Olivia grew red
Well perhaps I should
Im a fool like all women
But I ask you to let him alone to give his better self a chance
Why not ask him to let ME aloneto give MY better nature a chance
Youlaughing at me in these circumstances
You who pretended to be a man pretended to love Pauline Gardiner He started and his eyes blazed as if she had cut him across the face with a whip
Then he drew himself up with an expression of insolent fury
His lips his sharp white teeth were cruel
She bore his look without flinching
Yes she went on you think you love her
Yet you act as if her love were a degrading influence in your life as if she were a bad woman instead of one who ought to inspire a man to do and be his best
How ashamed shed be of you of your love if she could see you as you are nowthe tempter of all the bad impulses in this college
He could not trust himself to reply
He was suffocating with rage and shame
He lifted his hat walked rapidly away from her and went home
Pierson had never seen him in an ugly mood before
And he too was in an ugly mooddisgusted with his own conduct angry at Scarborough whom he held responsible for the unprecedented excesses of this last trip to Chicago and for their consequences
Whats happened
he asked sourly
Whats the matter with YOU
Your Olivia replied Scarborough with a vicious sneer has been insulting me for your sins
She is a shrew
I dont wonder you dropped her
Pierson rose slowly and faced him
You astonish me he said
I shouldnt have believed you capable of a speech which no gentleman could possibly utter
YOU sitting as a court of honor to decide whats becoming a gentleman
Scarborough looked amused contempt
My dear Pierson youre worse than offensiveyou are ridiculous
No man shall say such things to me especially a man who notoriously lives by his wits
Scarborough caught him up as if he had been a child and pinned him against the wall
Take that back he said or Ill kill you
His tone was as colorless as his face
Kill and be damned replied Pierson cool and disdainful
Youre a coward
Scarboroughs fingers closed on Piersons throat
Then flashed into his mind that warning which demands and gets a hearing in the wildest tempest of passion before an irrevocable act can be done
It came to him in the form of a reminder of his laughing remark to Pauline when he told her of the traditions of murder in his family
He released Pierson and fled from the apartment
Half an hour later Pierson was reading a note from him Ive invited some friends this evening
I trust it will be convenient for you to absent yourself
Theyll be out by eleven and then if you return we can decide which is to stay in the apartment and which to leave
Pierson went away to his fraternity house and at halfpast eight Scarborough Chalmers Jack Wilton and Brigham sat down to a game of poker
They had played about an hour the cards steadily against Chalmers and Brighamthe cards were usually against Brigham
He was a mere boy with passionate aspirations to be considered a sport
He had been going a rapid gait for a year
He had lost to Scarborough alone as much as he had expected to spend on the years education
Toward ten oclock there was a jackpot with fortythree dollars in it and Brigham was betting wildly his hands and his voice trembling his lips shriveled
With a sudden gesture Chalmers caught the ends of the table and jerked it back
Therein Brighams lapwere two cards
I thought so
exclaimed Chalmers
You dirty little cheat
Ive been watching you
The boy looked piteously at Chalmers sneering face at the faces of the others
The tears rolled down his cheeks
For Gods sake boys he moaned dont be hard on me
I was desperate
Ive lost everything and my father cant give me any more
Hes a poor man and he and mother have been economizing and sacrificing to send me here
And when I saw I was ruinedGod knows I didnt think what I was doing
He buried his face in his hands
Dont be hard on me he sobbed
Any one of you might have done the same if he was in my fix
You sniveling cur said Chalmers high and virtuous how dare you say such a thing
You forget youre among gentlemen None of that Chalmers interrupted Scarborough
The boys telling the truth
And nobody knows it better than YOU
This with a significant look into Chalmers eyes
They shifted and he colored
I agree with Scarborough said Wilton
We oughtnt to have let the boy into our games
We must never mention what has happened here this evening
But we cant allow a card sharp to masquerade as a gentleman objected Chalmers
I confess Scarborough I dont understand how you can be so easygoing in a matter of honor
You think I must have a fellowfeeling for dishonor eh
Scarborough smiled satirically
I suppose because I was sympathetic enough with you to overlook the fact that you were shy on your share of our Chicago trip
What do you mean
The three hundred you borrowed of Pierson when you thought he was too far gone to know what he was doing
My back was turnedbut there was the mirror
Chalmers sullen red face confirmed Scarboroughs charge
No continued Scarborough we GENTLEMEN ought to be charitable toward one anothers DISCOVERED lapses
He seated himself at his desk and wrote rapidly We the undersigned exonerate Edwin Brigham of cheating in the poker game in Hampden Scarboroughs rooms on Saturday evening February 20 18
And we pledge ourselves never to speak of the matter either to each other or to any one else
Ive signed first said Scarborough rising and holding the pen toward Chalmers
Now you fellows sign
Chalmers
Chalmers signed and then Wilton
Take Chalmers away with you said Scarborough to Wilton in an undertone
Ive something to say to Brigham
When they were gone he again seated himself at his desk and taking his checkbook wrote a check and tore it out
Now listen to me Brig he said friendlily to Brigham who seemed to be in a stupor
Ive won about six hundred dollars from you first and lastmore rather than less
Will that amount put you in the way of getting straight
Yes said Brigham dully
Then heres a check for it
And heres the paper exonerating you
AndI guess you wont play again soon
The boy choked back his sobs
I dont know how I ever came to do it Scarborough
Oh Im a dog a dog
When I started to come here my mother took me up to her bedroom and opened the drawer of her bureau and took out a savingsbank bookit had a credit of twelve hundred dollars
Do you see that
she said
When you were born I began to put by as soon as I was ableevery cent I could from the butter and the eggsto educate my boy
And now its all coming true she said Scarborough and we cried together
And Brigham burst into a storm of tears and sobs
Oh how could I do it
he said
How COULD I
Youve done wrong said Scarborough shakily but Ive done much worse Eddie
And its over now and everythingll be all right
But I cant take your money Scarborough
I must pay for what Ive done
You mean make your mother pay
No you must take it back Brigham
I owe it to youI owe it to your mother
This is the butter and egg money that II stole from her
He put the papers into the boys pocket
You and I are going to be friends he went on
Come round and see me tomorrowno Ill look you up
He put out his hand and held Brighams hand in a couragegiving grasp
AndI hope Ill have the honor of meeting your mother some day
Brigham could only look his feelings
Soon after he left Pierson came
His anger had evaporated and his chief emotion was dread lest Scarborough might still be angry
I want to take back he began eagerly as soon as his head was inside the door
I know you do but you shant replied Scarborough
What you said was true what Olivia said was true
Ive been acting like a blackguard
No said Pierson what I said was a disgraceful lie
Will you try to forget it Scarborough
FORGET it
Scarborough looked at his friend with brilliant eyes
Never
So help me God never
Its one of three things that have occurred today that I must never forget
Then we can go on as before
Youll still be my friend
Not STILL Fred but for the first time
He looked round the luxurious study with a laugh and a sigh
Itll be a ghastly job getting used to the sort of surroundings I can earn for myself
But Ive got to grin and bear it
Well stay on here together to the end of the termmy shares paid and besides Im not going to do anything sensational
Next yearwell see
While Pierson was having his final cigarette before going to bed he looked up from his book to see before him Scarborough even more tremendous and handsome in his gaudy pajamas
I wish to register a solemn vow said he with mock solemnity that did not hide the seriousness beneath
Hear me ye immortal gods
Never again never again will I engage in any game with a friend where there is a stake
I dont wish to tempt
I dont wish to be tempted
What nonsense
said Pierson
Youre simply cutting yourself off from a lot of fun
I have spoken said Scarborough and he withdrew to his bedroom
When the door was closed and the light out he paused at the edge of the bed and said And never again so long as he wishes to retain his title to the name man will Hampden Scarborough take from anybody anything which he hasnt honestly earned
And when he was in bed he muttered I shall be alone and I may stay poor and obscure but Ill get back my selfrespectand keep itPauline
X MRS JOHN DUMONT
And PaulineShe was now looking back upon the first year of her married life
She had been so brought up that at seventeen within a few weeks of eighteen she had only the vaguest notion of the meaning of the step she was about to take in really marrying John Dumont
Also it had never occurred to her as possible for a properly constituted woman not to love her husband
It was clearly her duty to marry Jack therefore the doubting thoughts and the ache at the heart which would not ease were merely more outcroppings of the same evil part of her nature that had tempted her into deceiving her parents and into entangling herself and Scarborough
She knew that if she were absolutely free she would not marry Jack
But she felt that she had bartered away her birthright of freedom and now being herself the daughter of HER father and HER mother she would honorably keep her bargain would love where she ought to loveat seventeen I will means I shall
And sothey were really married
But the days passed and there was no sign of the miracle she had confidently expected
The magic of the marriage vow failed to transform her Pauline Dumont was still Pauline Gardiner in mind and in heart
There was however a miracle undreamed of mysterious overwhelmingJohn Dumont the lover became John Dumont the husband
Beside this transformation the revelation that the world she loved and lived in did not exist for him or his world for her seemed of slight importance
She had not then experience enough to enable her to see that transformation and revelation were as intimately related as a lock and its key
Its all my fault she told herself
It must be my fault
And Dumont unanalytic and selfabsorbed was amused whenever Paulines gentleness reminded him of his mothers halfbelieved warnings that his wife had a will of her own and a mighty strong one
They were back at Saint X in August and lived at the Frobisher place in Indiana Streetalmost as pretentious as the Dumont homestead and in better taste
Old Mrs Dumont had gone to Chicago alone for the furnishings for her own house when she went for the furnishings for her sons house she got Mrs Gardiner to go alongand Paulines mother gave another of her many charming illustrations of the valuable truth that tact can always have its own way
Saint X was too keeneyed and too interested in the new Mrs Dumont to fail to note a change in her
It was satisfied with the surface explanation that Europe in general and Paris in particular were responsible
And it did not note that while she had always been full of life and fond of company she was now feverish in her restlessness incessantly seeking distraction never alone when she could either go somewhere or induce some one to come to her
You MUST be careful my dear said her motherinlaw as soon as she learned that she had a grandmotherly interest in her daughterinlaws health
Youll wear yourself out with all this running about
Pauline laughed carelessly recklessly
Oh Im disgustingly healthy
Nothing hurts me
Besides if I were quiet I think I shouldEXPLODE
Late in September Dumont had to go to New York
He asked her to go with him assuming that she would decline as she had visitors coming
But she was only too glad of the chance to give her increasing restlessness wider range
They went to the WaldorfScarborough and Pierson had been stopping there not a week before making ready for that sensational descent upon Battle Field which has already been recorded
The first evening Dumont took her to the play
The next morning he left her early for a busy day downtownand I may not be able to return for dinner
I warned you before we left Saint X he said as he rose from breakfast in their sittingroom
I understand she answered
You neednt bother to send word even if you dont wish
Ill be tired from shopping and shant care to go out this evening anyhow
In the afternoon she drove with Mrs Fanshaw wife of one of Jacks business acquaintancesthey had dined at the Fanshaws when they paused in New York on the way home from Europe
Pauline was at the hotel again at five while she and Mrs Fanshaw were having tea together in the palm garden a telegram was handed to her
She read it then said to Mrs Fanshaw I was going to ask you and your husband to dine with us
Jack sends word he cant be here butwhy shouldnt you come just the same
No you must go with us Mrs Fanshaw replied
Weve got a box at Weber and Fields and two men asked and we need another woman
Id have asked you before but there wouldnt be room for any more men
Mrs Fanshaw had to insist until she had proved that the invitation was sincere then Pauline accepteda distraction was always agreeable never so agreeable as when it offered itself unannounced
It was toward the end of the dinner that Mrs Fanshaw happened to say I see your husbands like all of them
I dont believe there ever was a woman an American man wouldnt desert for business
Oh I dont in the least mind replied Pauline
I like him to show that he feels free
Why when we were in Paris on the return trip and had been married only two months he got tangled up in business and used to leave me for a dayfor two days once
At Paulines right sat a carefully dressed young man whose name she had not caughtshe learned afterward that he was Mowbray Langdon
He was now giving her a stare of amused mockadmiration
When he saw that he had her attention he said Really Mrs Dumont I cant decide which to admire mostYOUR trust or your husbands
Pauline laughedit struck her as ridiculous that either she or Jack should distrust the other
Indeed she only hazily knew what distrust meant and hadnt any real belief that such things actually existed
Half an hour later the party was driving up to Weber and Fields
Pauline glancing across the thronged sidewalk and along the empty brilliantly lighted passage leading into the theater saw a striking peculiarlooking woman standing at the boxoffice while her escort parleyed with the clerk within
How much that man looks like Jack she said to herselfand then she saw that it was indeed Jack
Not the Jack she thought she knew but quite another person the one he tried to hide from hertoo carelessly because he made the common mistake of underestimating the sagacity of simplicity
A glance at the woman a second glance at Dumont his flushed insolent face now turned full frontand she KNEW this unfamiliar and hithertoonlyhinted Jack
The omnibus was caught in a jam of cars and carriages there were several moments of confusion and excitement
When the Fanshaw party was finally able to descend she saw that Jack and his companion were gonethe danger of a scene was over for the moment
She lingered and made the others linger wishing to give him time to get to his seats
When they entered the theater it was dark and the curtain was up
But her eyes searching the few boxes visible from the rear aisle found the woman or at least enough of her for recognitionthe huge black hat with its vast pale blue feather
Pauline drew a long breath of relief when the Fanshaws box proved to be almost directly beneath the box
If she had been a few years older she would have given its proper significance to the curious fact that this sudden revelation of the truth about her husband did not start a tempest of anger or jealousy but set her instantly to sacrificing at the shrine of the great god Appearances
It is notorious that of all the household gods he alone erects his altar only upon the hearth where the ashes are cold
As she sat there through the two acts she seemed to be watching the stage and taking part in the conversation of the Fanshaws and their friends yet afterward she could not recall a single thing that had occurred a single word that had been said
At the end of the last act she again made them linger so that they were the last to emerge into the passage
In the outside doorway she saw the womanjust a glimpse of a pretty empty laughing face with a mouth made to utter impertinences and eyes that invited them
Mrs Fanshaw was speakingYoure very tired arent you
Very replied Pauline with a struggle to smile
What a child you look
It seems absurd that you are a married woman
Why you havent your full growth yet
And on an impulse of intuitive sympathy Mrs Fanshaw pressed her arm and Pauline was suddenly filled with gratitude and liked her from that moment
Alone in her sittingroom at the hotel she went up to the mirror over the mantel and staring absently at herself put her hands up mechanically to take out her hatpins
No Ill keep my hat on she thought without knowing why
And she sat hat and wrap on and looked at a book
Half an hour and she took off her hat and wrap put them in a chair near where she was sitting
The watched hands of the clock crawled wearily round to halfpast one to two to halfpast two to threeeach halfhour an interminable stage
She wandered to the window and looked down into empty Fifth Avenue
When she felt that at least an hour had passed she turned to look at the clock againtwentyfive minutes to four
Her eyes were heavy
He is not coming she said aloud and leaving the lights on in the sittingroom locked herself in the bedroom
At five oclock she started up and seized the dressinggown on the chair near the head of the bed
She listenedheard him muttering in the sittingroom
She knew now that a crash of some kind had roused her
Several minutes of profound silence then through the door came a steady heavy snore
The dressinggown dropped from her hand
She slid from the bed slowly crossed the room softly opened the door looked into the sittingroom
A table and a chair lay upset in the middle of the floor
He was on a sofa sprawling disheveled snoring
Slowly she advanced toward himshe was barefooted and the white nightgown clinging to her slender figure and the long braid down her back made her look as young as her soulthe soul that gazed from her fixed fascinated eyes the soul of a girl of eighteen full as much child as woman still
She sat down before him in a low chair her elbows on her knees her chin supported by her hands her eyes never leaving his swollen dark red brutish facea cigar stump much chewed lay upon his cheek near his open mouth
He was as absurd and as repulsive as a gorged pig asleep in a wallow
The dawn burst into broad day but she sat on motionless until the clock struck the halfhour after six
Then she returned to the bedroom and locked herself in again
Toward noon she dressed and went into the sittingroom
He was gone and it had been put to rights
When he came at twenty minutes to one she was standing at the window but she did not turn
Did you get my note
he asked in a carefully careless tone
He went on to answer himself No there it is on the floor just where I put it under the bedroom door
No matterit was only to say I had to go out but would be back to lunch
Sorry I was kept so late last night
Glad you didnt wait up for mebut you might have left the bedroom door openitd have been perfectly safe
He laughed goodnaturedly
As it was I was so kindhearted that I didnt disturb you but slept on the sofa
As he advanced toward her with the obvious intention of kissing her she slowly turned and faced him
Their eyes met and he stopped shorther look was like the eternal ice that guards the pole
I saw you at the theater last night she said evenly
And this morning I sat and watched you as you lay on the sofa over there
He was taken completely off his guard
With a gasp that was a kind of groan he dropped into a chair the surface of his mind strewn with the wreckage of the lying excuses he had got ready
Please dont try to explain she went on in the same even tone
I understand now aboutabout Paris andeverything
I know thatfather was right
He gave her a terrified glanceno tears no trace of excitement only calmness and all the strength he knew was in her nature and in addition a strength he had not dreamed was there
What do you intend to do
he asked after a long silence
She did not answer immediately
When she did she was not looking at him
When I married youacross the river from Battle Field she said I committed a crime against my father and mother
This ismy punishmentthe beginning of it
And nowtherell be thethebaby A pause then I must bear the consequencesif I can
But I shall not be your wifenevernever again
If you wish me to stay on that condition Ill try
If not You MUST stay Pauline he interrupted
I dont care what terms you make you must stay
Its no use for me to try to defend myself when youre in this mood
You wouldnt listen
But youre right about not going
If you did itd break your fathers and mothers hearts
I admit I did drink too much last night and made a fool of myself
But if you were more experienced youd He thought he had worked his courage up to the point where he could meet her eyes
He tried it
Her look froze his flow of words
I KNOW that you were false from the beginning she said
The man I thought you were never existedand I know it
We wont speak of thiseverafter now
Surely you cant wish me to stay
And into her voice surged all her longing to go all her hope that he would reject the only terms on which selfrespect would let her stay
Wish you to stay
he repeated
And he faced her looking at her his chest heaving under the tempest of hate and passion that was raging in himhate because she was defying and dictating to him passion because she was so beautiful as she stood there like a delicate fine hothouse rose poised on a long graceful stem
No wonder I LOVE you
he exclaimed between his clenched teeth
A bright spot burned in each of her cheeks and her look made him redden and lower his eyes
Now that I understand these last five months she said that from you is an insult
His veins and muscles swelled with the fury he dared not show for he saw and felt how dangerous her mood was
Ill agree to whatever you like Pauline he said humbly
Only we mustnt have a flareup and a scandal
Ill never speak to you again aboutabout anything you dont want to hear
She went into her bedroom
When after half an hour she reappeared she was ready to go down to lunch
In the elevator he stole a glance at herthere was no color in her face not even in her lips
His rage had subsided he was ashamed of himselfbefore her
But he felt triumphant too
I thought shed go sure in spite of her fear of hurting her father and mother he said to himself
A mighty close squeak
I was stepping round in a powder magazine with every word a lit match
In January she sank into a profound lassitude
Nothing interested her everything wearied her
As the time drew near her mother came to stay with her and day after day the two women sat silent Mrs Gardiner knitting Pauline motionless hands idle in her lap mind vacant
If she had any emotion it was a hope that she would die and take her child with her
That would settle everything settle it right she reflected with youths morbid fondness for finalities
When it was all over and she came out from under the opiate she lay for a while openeyed but unseeing too inert to grope for the lost thread of memory
She felt a stirring in the bed beside her the movement of some living thing
She looked and there squeezed into the edge of the pillow was a miniature head of a little old manwrinkled copperish
Yet the face was fatludicrously fat
A painfully homely face with tears running from the closed eyes with an open mouth that driveled and drooled
What is it
she thought looking with faint curiosity
And why is it here
Two small fists now rose aimlessly in the air above the face and flapped about and a very tempest of noise issued from the sagging mouth
A baby she reflected
Then memory cameMY baby
She put her finger in the way of the wandering fists
First one of them then the other awkwardly unclosed and as awkwardly closed upon it
She smiled
The grip tightened and tightened and tightened until she wondered how hands so small and new could cling so close and hard
Then that electric clasp suddenly tightened about her heart
She burst into tears and drew the child against her breast
The pulse of its current of life was beating against her ownand she felt it
She sobbed laughed softly sobbed again
Her mother was bending anxiously over her
Whats the matter dearest
she asked
What do you wish
Nothing
Pauline was smiling through her tears
Oh mother I am SO happy
she murmured
And her happiness lasted with not a break with hardly a pause all that spring and all that summeror so long as her babys helplessness absorbed the whole of her time and thought
XI
YOUNG AMERICA
When Pierson laggard as usual returned to Battle Field a week after the end of the long vacation he found Scarborough just establishing himself
He had taken two small and severely plain rooms in a quaint old frame cottage one story high but perched importantly upon a bank at the intersection of two muchtraveled streets
What luck
asked Pierson lounging in on him
A hundred days campaign a thousand dollars net replied the book agent
And Im hard as oak from tramping those roads and Ive learnedyou ought to have been along Pierson
I know people as I never could have come to know them by any other meanswhat they think what they want how they can be reached
There was still much of the boy in Piersons face
But Scarborough looked the man developed ready
Pierson wandered into the bedroom to complete his survey
I see youre going to live by the clock he called out presently
He had found pasted to the wall Scarboroughs schedule of the daily division of his time just above it upon a shelf was a new alarm clock the bell so big that it overhung like a canopy
You dont mean youre going to get up at four
Every morningall winter replied Scarborough without stopping his unpacking
You see Im going to finish this yeartake the two years in one
Then Ive registered in a law officeJudge Holcombes
And theres my speakingI must practise that every day
Pierson came back to the sittingroom and collapsed into a chair
I see you allow yourself five hours for sleep he said
Its too much old man
Youre selfindulgent
Thats a mistake replied Scarborough
Since making out the schedule Ive decided to cut sleep down to four hours and a half
Thats more like it
We all sleep too much he continued
And as I shant smoke or drink or worry Ill need even less than the average man
Im going to do nothing but work
A man doesnt need much rest from mere work
What
No play
Play all the time
Ive simply changed my playthings
Pierson seated himself at the table and stared gloomily at his friend
Look here old man
For heavens sake dont let Olivia find out about this program
But Olivia did hear of it and Pierson was compelled to leave his luxury in the main street and to take the two remaining available rooms at Scarboroughs place
His bed was against the wall of Scarboroughs bedroomthe wall where the alarm clock was
At four oclock on his first morning he started from a profound sleep
My bed must be moved into my sittingroom today he said to himself as soon as the clamor of Scarboroughs gong died away and he could collect his thoughts
But at four oclock the next morning the gong penetrated the two walls as if they had not been there
I see my finish he groaned sitting up and tearing at his hair
He tried to sleep again but the joint pressure of Olivias memorymirrored gray eyes and of disordered nerves from the racking gong forced him to make an effort to bestir himself
Groaning and muttering he rose and in the starlight looked from his window
Scarborough was going up the deserted street on his way to the woods for his morning exercise
His head was thrown back and his chest extended and his long legs were covering four feet at a stride
You old devil
said Pierson his tone suggesting admiration and affection rather than anger
But Ill outwit you
By a subterfuge in which a sympathetic doctor was the main factor he had himself permanently excused from chapel
Then he said to Scarborough You get up too late old man
My grandfather used to say that only a drone lies abed after two in the morning wasting the best part of the day
You ought to turn in say at halfpast nine and rise in time to get your hardest work out of the way before the college day begins
That sounds reasonable replied Scarborough after a moments consideration
Ill try it
And so it came to pass that Pierson went to bed at the sound of Scarboroughs twooclock rising gong and pieced out his sleep with an occasional nap in recitations and lectures and for an hour or two late in the afternoon
He was able once more to play poker as late as he liked and often had time for reading before the gong sounded
And Scarborough was equally delighted with the new plan
I gain at least one hour a day perhaps two he said
Your grandfather was a wise man
Toward spring Mills western manager of the publishing house for which Scarborough had sold Peaks of Progress through Michigan came to Battle Field to see him
You were far and away the best man we had out last year said he
Youre a born book agent
Thank you said Scarborough sincerely
He appreciated that a man can pay no higher compliment than to say that another is master of his own trade
We got about fifty orders from people who thought it over after youd tried to land them and failedthat shows the impression you made
And you sold as many books as our best agent in our best field
Ill never go as agent again said Scarborough
The experience was invaluablebut sufficient
We dont want you to go as agent
Our proposition is for much easier and more dignified work
At the word dignified Scarborough could not restrain a smile
Ive practically made my plans for the summer he said
I think weve got something worth your while Mr Scarborough
Our idea is for you to select about a hundred of the young fellows whore working their way through here and train them in your methods of approaching people
Then youll take them to Wisconsin and Minnesota and send them out each man to a district you select for him
In that way youll help a hundred young men to earn a year at college and youll make a good sum for yourselftwo or three times what you made last summer
Scarborough had intended to get admitted to the bar in June to spend the summer at an apprenticeship in a law office and to set up for himself in the fall
But this plan was most attractiveit would give him a new kind of experience and would put him in funds for the wait for clients
The next day he signed an advantageous contracthis expenses for the summer and a guaranty of not less than three thousand dollars clear
He selected a hundred young men and twelve young women the most intelligent of the five hundred selfsupporting students at Battle Field
Pierson having promised to behave himself was permitted to attend the first lesson
The scholars at the Scarborough School for Book Agents filled his quarters and overflowed in swarms without the windows and the door
The weather was still cool but all must hear and the rooms would hold barely half the brigade
I assume that youve read the book began Scarborough
He was standing at the table with the paraphernalia of a book agent spread upon it
But you must read it again and again until you know whats on every page until you have by heart the passages Ill point out to you
He looked at Drexela freshman of twentytwo with earnest sleepless eyes and a lofty forehead in the past winter he had become acquainted with hunger and with that cold which creeps into the room crawls through the thin covers and closes in icy as death about the heart
What do you think of the book Drexel
The young manhe is high in the national administration todayflushed and looked uneasy
Speak frankly
I want your candid opinion
Well I must say Mr Scarborough I think its pretty bad
Thank you said Scarborough and he glanced round
Does anybody disagree with Mr
Drexel
There was not a murmur
Pierson covered his face to hide his smile at this jolt for his friend
In the group round one of the windows a laugh started and spread everywhere except to seven of the twelve young women and to those near ScarboroughTHEY looked frightened
I expected Mr Drexels answer began Scarborough
Before you can sell Peaks of Progress each of you must be convinced that its a book he himself would buy
And I see youve not even read it
Youve at most glanced at it with unfriendly eyes
This book is not literature gentlemen
It is a storehouse of facts
It is an educational work so simply written and so brilliantly illustrated that the very children will hang over its pages with delight
If you attend to your training in our coming three months of preliminary work youll find during the summer that the books power to attract the children is its strongest point
I made nearly half my sales last summer by turning from the parents to the children and stirring their interest
Pierson was now no more inclined to smile than were the pupils
When I started out continued Scarborough I too had just glanced at the book and had learned a few facts from the prospectus
And I failed to sell except to an occasional fool whom I was able to overpower
Every one instinctively felt the estimate I myself placed upon my goods
But as I went on the book gradually forced itself upon me
And long before the summer was over I felt that I was an ambassador of education to those eager people
And Im proud that I sold as many books as I did
Each book I know is a radiating center of pleasure of thought of aspiration to higher things
No ladies and gentlemen you must first learn that these eight hundred pages crowded with facts of history these six hundred illustrations taken from the best sources and flooding the text with light together constitute a work that should be in all humble households
Scarborough had his audience with him now
Never sneer he said in conclusion
Sneering will accomplish nothing
Learn your business
Put yourself your BEST self into it
And then you may hope to succeed at it
He divided his pupils into six classes of about twenty each and dismissed them asking the first class to come at three the next afternoon
The young men and young women went thoughtfully away they were revolving their initial lesson in the cardinal principle of successenthusiasm
When the two friends were alone Pierson said Do you know Im beginning to get a glimpse of you
And I see there isnt anything beyond your reach
Youll get whatever you want
Scarboroughs reply was a sudden look of dejection an impatient shrug
Then he straightened himself lifted his head with a lionlike toss that shook back the obstinate lock of hair from his forehead
He laid his hand on his friends shoulder
Yes he said because Im determined to want whatever I get
Good fortune and badeverything shall be grist for THIS mill
Pierson attended next days class and afterward went to Olivia with an account of it
You ought to have seen him put those fellows through one at a time
I tell you hell teach them more in the next three months than theyll learn of the whole faculty
And this summer hell get every man and woman of them enough to pay their way through college next year
What did he do today
asked Olivia
Of the many qualities she loved in Pierson the one she loved most was his unbounded unselfish admiration for his friend
He took each man separately the others watching and listening
First hed play the part of book agent with his pupil as a reluctant customer
Then hed reverse and the pupil as agent would try to sell him the book he pretending to be an ignorant obstinate illnatured closefisted farmer or farmers wife
It was a liberal education in the art of persuasion
If his pupils had his brains and his personality Peaks of Progress would be on the centertable in half the farm parlors of Wisconsin and Minnesota by September
IF they had his personality and IF they had his brains said Olivia
Well as it is hell make the dumbest ass in the lot bray to some purpose
In September when Scarborough closed his headquarters at Milwaukee and set out for Indianapolis he found that the average earnings of his agents were two hundred and seventyfive dollars and that he himself had made fortythree hundred
Mills came and offered him a place in the publishing house at ten thousand a year and a commission
He instantly rejected it
He had already arranged to spend a year with one of the best law firms in Indianapolis before opening an office in Saint X the largest town in the congressional district in which his farm lay
But theres no hurry about deciding said Mills
Remember well make you rich in a few years
My road happens not to lie in that direction replied Scarborough carelessly
Ive no desire to be rich
Its too easy if one will consent to give moneymaking his exclusive attention
Mills looked amusedhad he not known Scarboroughs ability he would have felt derisive
Moneys power said he
And there are only two ambitions for a wideawake manmoney and power
Money cant buy the kind of power Id care for answered Scarborough
If I were to seek power itd be the power that comes through ability to persuade
Money talks said Mills laughing
Money bellows retorted Scarborough and bribes and browbeats bully and coward that it is
But it never persuades
Ill admit its a coward
 And I hope I can always frighten enough of it into my service to satisfy my needs
But Im not spending my life in its serviceno thank you
XII
AFTER EIGHT YEARS
While Scarborough was serving his clerkship at Indianapolis Dumont was engaging in ever larger and more daring speculations with New York as his base
Thus it came about that when Scarborough established himself at Saint X Dumont and Pauline were living in New York in a big house in East Sixtyfirst Street
And Pauline had welcomed the change
In Saint X she was constantly on guard always afraid her father and mother would see below that smiling surface of her domestic life which made them happy
In New York she was free from the crushing sense of peril and restraint as their delusions about her were secure
There after she and he found their living basis of let alone they got on smoothly rarely meeting except in the presence of servants or guests never inquiring either into the others life carrying on all negotiations about money and other household matters through their secretaries
He thought her cold by naturetherefore absolutely to be trusted
And what other man with the pomp and circumstance of a great and growing fortune to maintain had so admirable an instrument
An ideal wife he often said to himself
And he was not the man to speculate as to what was going on in her head
He had no interest in what others thought how they were filling the places he had assigned themthat was his only concern
In one of those days of pause which come now and then in the busiest lives she chanced upon his letters from Europe in her winter at Battle Field
She took one of them from its envelope and began to readcarelessly with a languid curiosity to measure thus exactly the change in herself
But soon she was absorbed her mind groping through letter after letter for the clue to a mystery
The Dumont she now knew stood out so plainly in those letters that she could not understand how she inexperienced and infatuated though she then was had failed to see the perfect fulllength portrait
How had she read romance and highmindedness and intellect into the personality so frankly flaunting itself in all its narrow sordidness in all its poverty of real thought and real feeling
And there was Hampden Scarborough to contrast him with
With this thought the truth suddenly stared at her made her drop the letter and visibly shrink
It was just because Scarborough was there that she had been tricked
The slight surface resemblance between the two men hardly more than the favor found in all men of the family of strong and tenacious will had led her on to deck the absent Dumont with the manhood of the present Scarborough
She had read Scarborough into Dumonts letters
Yes andthe answers she addressed and mailed to Dumont had really been written to Scarborough
She tossed the letters back into the box from which they had reappeared after four long years
She seated herself on the white bearskin before the open fire and with hands clasped round her knees she rocked herself slowly to and fro like one trying to ease an intolerable pain
Until custom dulled the edge of that pain the days and the nights were the cruelest in her apprenticeship up to that time
When her boy Gardiner was five years old she got her father and mother to keep him at Saint X with them
New Yorks no place I think to bring up and educate a boy in the right way she explained
And it was the truth though not the whole truth
The concealed part was that she would have made an open break with her husband had there been no other way of safeguarding their allseeing allnoting boy from his example
Before Gardiner went to live with his grandparents she stayed in the East making six or eight brief visits home each year
When he went she resolved to divide her year between her pleasure as a mother and her obligation to her sons father to her parents soninlawher devotions at the shrine of Appearances
It was in the fall of the year she was twentyfiveeight years and a half after she left Battle Fieldthat Hampden Scarborough reappeared upon the surface of her life
On a September afternoon in that year Olivia descending from the train at Saint X was almost as much embarrassed as pleased by her changed young cousin rushing at her with great energyDear dear Olivia
And hardly any differenthows the baby
Nonot Fred but Fred Junior I mean
In some ways you positively look younger
You know you were SO serious at college
But youI dont quite understand how any one can be so changed yetrecognizable
I guess its the plumage
Youre in a new editionan edition deluxe
Paulines dressmakers were bringing out the full value of her height and slender graceful strength
Her eyes full of the same old frankness and courage now had experience in them too
She was wearing her hair so that it fell from her brow in two sweeping curves reflecting the light in sparkles and flashes
Her manner was still simple and genuinethe simplicity and genuineness of knowledge now not of innocence
Extremes meetbut they remain extremes
Her plumage was a fashionable dress of pale blue cloth a big beplumed hat to match a chiffon parasol like an azure cloud at her throat a sapphire pendant about her neck and swinging far below her waist a chain of sapphires
And the plumage just suits her thought Olivia
For it seemed to her that her cousin had more than ever the quality she most admiredthe quality of individuality of distinction
Even in her way of looking clean and fresh she was different as if those prime feminine essentials were in her not matters of frequent reacquirement but inherent and inalienable like her brilliance of eyes and smoothness of skin
Olivia felt a slight tugging at the bag she was carrying
She lookedan English groom in spotless summer livery was touching his hat in respectful appeal to her to let go
Give Albert your checks too said Pauline putting her arm around her cousins waist to escort her down the platform
At the entrance with a group of station loungers gaping at it was a phaetonvictoria lined with some creamcolored stuff like silk the horses and liveried coachman rigid
Shes giving Saint X a good deal to talk about thought Olivia
Home please by the long road said Pauline to the groom and he sprang to the box beside the coachman and they were instantly in rapid motion
Thatll let us have twenty minutes more together she went on to Olivia
There are several people stopping at the house
The way led through Munroe Avenue the main street of Saint X Olivia was astonished at the changesthe town of nine years before spread and remade into an energetic city of twentyfive thousand
Fred told me Id hardly recognize it said she but I didnt expect this
Its another proof how farsighted Hampden Scarborough is
Everybody advised him against coming here but he would come
And the town has grown and at the same time hes had a clear field to make a big reputation as a lawyer in a few years not to speak of the power hes got in politics
But wouldnt he have won no matter where he was
suggested Pauline Sooner or laterbut not so soon replied Olivia
Noa tree doesnt have to grow so tall among a lot of bushes before its noticed as it does in a forest
And youve never seen him since Battle Field
As Olivia put this question she watched her cousin narrowly without seeming to do so
But replied Paulineand Olivia thought that both her face and her tone were a shade off the easy and the naturalsince he came Ive been living in New York and havent stayed here longer than a few days until this summer
And hes been in Europe since April
No she went on Ive not seen a soul from Battle Field
Its been like a painting finished and hanging on the wall one looks toward oftenest and influencing ones life every day
They talked on of Battle Field of the boys and girls they had knownhow Thiebaud was dead and Mollie Crittenden had married the man who was governor of California what Howe was not doing the novels Chamberlayne was writing the big womens college in Kansas that Grace Wharton was vicepresident of
Then of Piersonin the state senate and in a fair way to get to Congress the next year
Then Scarborough againhow he had distanced all the others how he might have the largest practice in the state if he would take the sort of clients most lawyers courted assiduously how strong he was in politics in spite of the opposition of the professionalsstrong because he had a genius for organization and also had the ear and the confidence of the people and the enthusiastic personal devotion of the young men throughout the state
Olivia more of a politician than Fred even knew the whole story and Pauline listened appreciatively
Few indeed are the homes in strenuously political Indiana where politics is not the chief subject of conversation and Pauline had known about parties and campaigns as early as she had known about dolls and dresses
But you must have heard most of this said Olivia from people here in Saint X
Some of itfrom father and mother Pauline answered
Theyre the only people Ive seen really to talk to on my little visits
They know him very well indeed
I think mother admires him almost as much as you do
Heres our place she added the warmth fading from her face as from a spring landscape when the shadow of the dusk begins to creep over it
They were in the grounds of the Eyriethe elder Dumont was just completing it when he died early in the previous spring
His widow went abroad to live with her daughter and her sister in Paris so her son and his wife had taken it
It was a great rambling stone house that hung upon and in a lofty bluff
From its windows and verandas and balconies could be seen the panorama of Saint Christopher
To the left lay the town its ugly partits factories and railway yardshidden by the jut of a hill
Beneath and beyond to the right the shining river wound among fields brown where the harvests had been gathered green and white where myriads of graceful tassels waved above acres on acres of Indian corn
And the broad leaves sent up through the murmur of the river a rhythmic rustling like a sigh of content
Once in a while a passing steamboat made the sonorous cry of its whistle and the melodious beat of its paddles echo from hill to hill
Between the house and the hilltop highway lay several hundred acres of lawn and garden and wood
The rooms of the Eyrie and its wellscreened verandas were in a cool twilight though the September sun was hot
Theyre all out or asleep said Pauline as she and Olivia entered the wide reception hall
Lets have tea on the east veranda
Its view isnt so good but well be cooler
Youd like to go to your room first
Olivia said she was comfortable as she was and needed the tea
So they went on through the splendidlyfurnished drawingroom and were going through the library when Olivia paused before a portraitYour husband isnt it
Yes replied Pauline standing behind her cousin
We each had one done in Paris
What a masterful face
said Olivia
Ive never seen a better forehead
And she thought Hes of the same type as Scarborough exceptwhat is it I dislike in his expression
Do you notice a resemblance to any one you know
asked Pauline
Yees replied Olivia coloring
I think Scarborough isnt it
Yes admitted Olivia
After a pause Pauline said ambiguously The resemblance is stronger there than in life
Olivia glanced at her and was made vaguely uneasy by the look she was directing at the face of the portrait
But though Pauline must have seen that she was observed she did not change expression
They went out upon the east veranda and Olivia stood at the railing
She hardly noted the view in the press of thoughts roused by the hints of what was behind the richly embroidered curtain of her cousins life
All along the bluff some exposed some half hid by dense foliage were the pretentious houses of the thirty or forty families who had grown rich through the industries developed within the past ten years
Two foreignlooking servants in foreignlooking houseliveries were bringing a table on which was an enormous silver tray with a teaservice of antique silver and artistic china
As Olivia turned to seat herself a young man and a woman of perhaps forty obviously from the East came through the doors at the far end of the long porch
Both were in white carefully dressed and groomed both suggested a mode of life whose leisure had never been interrupted
Who are coming
asked Olivia
She wished she had gone to her room before tea
These people made her feel dowdy and mussy
Pauline glanced round smiled and nodded turned back to her cousin
Mrs Herron and Mr Langdon
Shes the wife of a New York lawyer and she takes Mr Langdon everywhere with her to amuse her and he goes to amuse himself
Hes a socialist or something like that
He thinks up and says things to shock conservative conventional people
Hes rich and never has workedcouldnt if he would probably
But he denounces leisure classes and large fortunes and advocates manual labor every day for everybody
Hes clever in a queer cynical way
A Mrs Fanshaw also of New York came from the library in a teagown of chiffon and real lace
All were made acquainted and Pauline poured the tea
As Olivia felt shy and was hungry she ate the little sandwiches and looked and listened and thoughtlooked and thought rather than listened
These were certainly wellbred people yet she did not like them
Theyre in earnest about trifles she said to herself and trifle about earnest things
Yet it irritated her to feel that though they would care not at all for her low opinion of them she did care a great deal because they would fail to appreciate her
They ought to be jailed Langdon was drawling with considerable emphasis
Who Mr
Langdon
inquired Mrs Fanshawshe had been as abstracted as Olivia
Youve been filling the jails rapidly today and hanging not a few
Mrs Herron laughed
He says your husband and Mrs Dumonts and mine should be locked up as conspirators
Precisely said Langdon tranquilly
Theyll sign a few papers and when theyre done whatll have happened
Not one more sheepll be raised
Not one more pound of wool will be shorn
Not one more laborerll be employed
Not a single improvement in any process of manufacture
But on the other hand the farmerll have to sell his wool cheaper the consumerll have to pay a bigger price for blankets and all kinds of clothes for carpetsfor everything wool goes into
And these few men will have trebled their fortunes and at least trebled their incomes
Does anybody deny that such a performance is a crime
Why in comparison a burglar is honorable and courageous
HE risks liberty and life
Dreadful
Dreadful
exclaimed Mrs Fanshaw in mock horror
You must go at once Mowbray and lead the police in a raid on Jacks office
Thanksits more comfortable here
Langdon took a piece of a curiouslooking kind of hot bread
Extraordinary good stuff this is he interjected then went on And Ive done my duty when Ive stated the facts
Also Im taking a little stock in the new trust
But I dont pose as a captain of industry or promoter of civilization
I admit Im a robber
My point is the rotten hypocrisy of my fellow banditsno pickpockets by gad
Olivia looked at him with disapproving interest
It was the first time she had been present at a game of battledore and shuttlecock with what she regarded as fundamental morals
Langdon noted her expression and said to Pauline in a tone of contrition that did not conceal his amusement Ive shocked your cousin Mrs
Dumont
I hope so replied Pauline
Im sure we all ought to be shockedand should be if it werent you who are trying to do the shocking
Shell soon get used to you
Then it was a jest
said Olivia to Langdon
A jest
He looked serious
Not at all my dear Mrs Pierson
Every word I said was true and worse
They Stop your nonsense Mowbray interrupted Mrs Herron who appreciated that Olivia was an outsider
Certainly he was jesting Mrs Pierson
Mr Langdon pretends to have eccentric ideasone of them is that everybody with brains should be put under the feet of the numskulls another is that anybody who has anything should be locked up and his property given to those who have nothing
Splendid
exclaimed Langdon
And he took out a gold cigarette case and lighted a large expensivelooking cigarette with a match from a gold safe
Go on dear lady
Herron should get you to write our prospectus when were ready to unload on the public
The dear public
How it does yearn for a share in any piratical enterprise that flies the snowy flag of respectability
He rose
Wholl play English billiards
All right said Mrs Herron rising
And I too said Mrs Fanshaw
Give me one of your cigarettes Mowbray said Mrs Herron
I left my case in my room
Pauline answering Olivias expression said as soon as the three had disappeared Why not
Is it any worse for a woman than for a man
I dont know why not replied Olivia
There must be another reason than because I dont do it and didnt think ladies did
But thats the only reason I can give just now
What do you think of Langdon
asked Pauline
I guess my sense of humors defective
I dont like the sort of jest he seems to excel in
I fancy it wasnt altogether a jest said Pauline
I dont inquire into those matters any more
I used to butthe more I saw the worse it was
Tricks and traps and squeezes andoh business is all vulgar and low
Its necessary I suppose but its repulsive to me
She paused then added carelessly yet with a certain deliberateness I never meddle with Mr Dumont nor he with me
Olivia wished to protest against Paulines view of business
Buthow could she without seeming to attack indeed without attacking her cousins husband
Dumont brought Fanshaw up in his automobile Herron remaining at the offices for half an hour to give the newspapers a carefully considered account of the muchdiscussed merger of the manufacturers of lowgrade woolens
Herron had objected to any statement
Its our private business he said
Let them howl
The fewer facts they have the sooner theyll stop howling
But Dumont held firm for publicity
Theres no such thing as a private business nowadays he replied
Besides dont we want the public to take part of our stock
Whats the use of acting shadyyouve avoided the legal obstacles havent you
Lets tell the public frankly all we want it to know and itll think it knows all there is to know
The whole party met in the drawingroom at a quarterpast eight Langdon the last to come downOlivia was uncertain whether or not she was unjust to him when she suspected design in his late entrance the handsomest and the bestdressed man of the company
He looked cynically at Dumont
Well fellow pirate how go our plans for a merry winter for the poor
Ass
muttered Herron to Olivia who happened to be nearest him
He fancies impudence is wit
Hes devoid of moral sense or even of decency
Hes a traitor to his class and shouldnt be tolerated in it
Dumont was laughingly answering Langdon in his own vein
Splendidly he replied thanks to our worthy chaplain Herron who secures us the blessing and protection of the law
That gives me an appetite
exclaimed Langdon
I feared something might miscarry in these last hours of our months of plotting
Heaven be praised the people wont have so much to waste hereafter
Im proud to be in one of the many noble bands that are struggling to save them from themselves
But Dumont had turned away from him so he dropped into Mrs Herrons discussion with Mrs Fanshaw on their proposed trip to the Mediterranean
Dinner was announced and he was put between Mrs Herron and Olivia with Dumont on her right
It was a round table and Olivias eyes lingered upon its detailsthe embroidered cloth with real lace in the center the graceful antique silver candlesticks the tall vases filled with enormous roseseverything exquisitely simple and tasteful
Langdon talked with her until Mrs Herron impatient at his neglect caught his eye and compelled his attention
Dumont seeing that Olivia was free drew her into his conversation with Mrs Fanshaw and then Mrs Fanshaw began to talk with Mr Herron who was eating furiously because he had just overheard Langdon say That was a great day for pirates when they thought of taking aboard the lawyers as chaplains
All the men were in high spirits Dumont was boyish in his exuberance
When he left home that morning he was four times a millionaire now he was at least twelve times a millionaire through the magic of the merger
True eight of the twelve millions were on paper but it was paper that would certainly pay dividends paper that would presently sell at or near its face value
And this success had come when he was only thirtyfour
His mind was already projecting greater triumphs in this modern necromancy by which millionaires evoke and materialize millions from the empty airapparently
He was bubbling over with happinessin the victory won in victories to be won
Olivia tried him on several subjects but the conversation dragged
Of Pauline he would not talk of Europe he was interested only in the comfort of hotels and railway trains in the comparative merits of the cooking and the wines in London and Paris
But his facealert shrewd aggressiveand his mode of expression made her feel that he was uninteresting because he was thinking of something which he did not care to expose to her and could not take his mind from
And this was the truth
It was not until she adventured upon his business that he became talkative
And soon she had him telling her about his combinefrankly boastfully his face more and more flushed for as he talked he drank
But he said presently this little matter today is only a fair beginning
It seemed big until it was about accomplished
Then I saw it was only a suggestion for a scheme thatd be really worth while
And he went on to unfold one of those projects of todays commerce and finance that were regarded as fantastic delirious a few years ago
He would reach out and out for hundreds of millions of capital with his woolens combine as a basis he would build an enormous corporation to control the sheep industry of the worldto buy millions of acres of sheepranges to raise scores of millions of sheep to acquire and to construct hundreds of plants for utilizing every part of the raw product of the ranges to sell wherever the human race had or could have a market
Olivia was ambitious herself usually was delighted by ambition in others
But his exhibit of imagination and energy repelled her even while it fascinated
Partly through youth more through that contempt for concealment which characterizes the courageous type of large man he showed himself to her just as he was
And she saw him not as an ambition but as an appetite or rather a bundle of appetites
He has no ideals she thought
Hes like a man who wants food merely for itself not for the strength and the intellect it will build up
And he likes or dislikes human beings only as one likes or dislikes different things to eat
Itll take you years and years she said to him because she must say something
Not at all
He waved his handOlivia thought it looked as much like a claw as like a hand
Its a skyscraper but we build skyscrapers overnight
Time and space used to be the big elements
WE practically disregard them
He followed this with a selfsatisfied laugh and an emptying of his champagne glass at a gulp
The women were rising to withdraw
After half an hour Langdon and Herron joined them
Dumont and Fanshaw did not come until eleven oclock
Then Dumont was so abrupt and surly that every one was grateful to Mrs Fanshaw for taking him away to the west veranda
At midnight all went to their rooms Pauline going with Olivia to make sure you havent been neglected
She lingered until after one and when they kissed each the other good night she said Its done me a world of good to see you Liviamore even than I hoped
I knew youd be sympathetic with me where you understood
Now I feel that youre sympathetic where you dont understand too
And its there that one really needs sympathy
Thats what friendship meansandlove said Olivia
XIII
MY SISTERINLAW GLADYS
The following afternoon Dumont took the Herrons the Fanshaws and Langdon back to New York in his private car and for three days Olivia and Pauline had the Eyrie to themselves
Olivia was about to write to Scarborough asking him to call when she saw in the NewsBulletin that he had gone to Denver to speak
A week after she left Dumont returned bringing his sister Gladys just arrived from Europe and Langdon
He stayed four days took Langdon away with him and left Gladys
Thus it came about that Scarborough riding into Colonel Gardiners grounds one hot afternoon in mid September saw a phaetonvictoria with two women in it coming toward him on its way out
He drew his horse aside to make room
He was conscious that there were two women he saw only oneshe who was all in white except the scarlet poppies against the brim of her big white hat
As he bowed the carriage stopped and Pauline said cordially Why how dye do
He drew his horse close to the carriage and they shook hands
She introduced the other womanMy sisterinlaw Gladys Dumontthen went on Weve been lunching and spending the afternoon with father and mother
They told us you returned this morning
I supposed you were in the East said Scarboroughthe first words he had spoken
OhIm living here nowGladys and I
Father says you never go anywhere but I hope youll make an exception for us
Thank youIll be glad to call
Why not dine with usday after tomorrow night
Id like thatcertainly Ill come
We dine at halfpast eightat least were supposed to
Scarborough lifted his hat
The carriage drove on
Why hes not a bit as I expected Gladys began at once
Hes much younger
ISNT he handsome
Thats the way a MAN ought to look
Hes not married
No replied Pauline
Why did you look so queer when you first caught sight of him
Did I
Pauline replied tranquilly
Probably it was because he very suddenly and vividly brought Battle Field back to methat was the happiest time of my life
But I was too young or too foolish or both to know it till long afterward
At seventeen one takes happiness for granted
Did he look then as he does now
Noand yes said Pauline
He was just from the farm and dressed badly and was awkward at times
Butreally he was the same person
I guess it was the little change in him that startled me
And she became absorbed in her thoughts
I hope youll send him in to dinner with me said Gladys presently
What did you say
asked Pauline absently
I was talking of Mr Scarborough
I asked if you wouldnt send him in to dinner with meunless you want to discuss old times with him
Yescertainlyif you wish
And Pauline gave Scarborough to Gladys and did her duty as hostess by taking in the dullest man in the partyNewnham
While Newnham droned and prosed she watched Gladys lay herself out to please the distinguished Mr Scarborough successful as a lawyer famous as an orator deferred to because of his influence with the rank and file of his party in the middle West
Gladys had blueblack hair which she wore pulled out into a sort of halo about her small delicate face
There were points of light in her dark irises giving them the look of black quartz in the sunshine
She was not tall but her figure was perfect and she had her dresses fitted immediately to it
Her appeal was frankly to the senses the edge taken from its audacity by its artistic effectiveness and by her ingenuous almost innocent expression
Seeing Pauline looking at her she tilted her head to a graceful angle and sent a radiant glance between two blossomladen branches of the green and white bush that towered and spread in the center of the table
Mr Scarborough says she called out character isnt a development its a disclosure
He thinks one is born a certain kind of person and that ones life simply either gives it a chance to show or fails to give it a chance
He says the boy isnt father to the man but the miniature of the man
What do you think Pauline
I havent thought of it replied Pauline
But Im certain its true
I used to dispute Mr Scarboroughs ideas sometimes but I learned better
As she realized the implications of her careless remark their eyes met squarely for the first time since Battle Field
Both hastily glanced away and neither looked at the other again
When the men came up to the drawingroom to join the women Gladys adroitly intercepted him
When he went to Pauline to take leave their manner each toward the other was formal strained and even distant
Dumont came again just after the November election
It had been an unexpected victory for the party which Scarborough advocated and everywhere the talk was that he had been the chief factorhis skill in defining issues his eloquence in presenting them the public confidence in his party through the dominance of a man so obviously free from selfseeking or political trickery of any kind
Dumont to whom control in both party machines and in the state government was a business necessity told his political agent Merriweather that they had let Scarborough go about far enough unless he could be brought into their camp
I cant make out what hes looking for said Merriweather
One things certainhell do US no good
Theres no way we can get our hooks in him
He dont give a damn for money
And as for powerhe can get more of that by fighting us than by falling in line
We aint exactly popular
This seemed to Dumont rank ingratitude
Had he not just divided a million dollars among charities and educational institutions in the districts where opposition to his merger was strongest
Well well see he said
If he isnt careful well have to kill him off in convention and make the committees stop his mouth
The trouble is hes been building up a following of his ownthe sort of following that cant be honeyfugled replied Merriweather
The committees are afraid of him
Merriweather always took the gloomy view of everything because he thus discounted his failures in advance and doubled the effect of his successes
Ill seeIll see said Dumont impatiently
And he thought he was beginning to see when Gladys expanded to him upon the subject of Scarboroughhis good looks his wit his distinction
Scarborough came to dinner a few evenings later and Dumont was particularly cordial to him and Gladys made the most of the opportunity which Pauline again gave her
That night when the others had left or had gone to bed Gladys followed her brother into the smokeroom adjoining the library
They sat in silence drinking a nightcap
In the dreaminess of her eyes in the absent smile drifting round the corners of her full red lips Gladys showed that her thoughts were pleasant and sentimental
What do you think of Scarborough
her brother asked suddenly
She started but did not flushin her long European experience she had gained control of that signal of surprise
How do you mean
she asked
She rarely answered a question immediately no matter how simple it was but usually put another question in reply
Thus she insured herself time to think if time should be necessary
I mean do you like him
Why certainly
But Ive seen him only a few times
Hes an uncommon man continued her brother
Hed make a mighty satisfactory husband for an ambitious woman especially one with the money to push him fast
Gladys slowly lifted and slowly lowered her smooth slender shoulders
That sort of thing doesnt interest a woman in a man unless shes married to him and has got over thinking more about him than about herself
It ought to replied her brother
A clever woman can always slosh round in sentimental slop with her head above it and cool
If I were a girl Id make a dead set for that chap
If you were a girl said Gladys youd do nothing of the sort
Youd compel him to make a dead set for you
And as she put down her glass she gave his hair an affectionate pullwhich was her way of thanking him for saying what she most wished to hear on the subject she most wished to hear about
XIV
STRAINING AT THE ANCHORS
Gladys was now twentyfour and was even more anxious to marry than is the average unmarried person
She had been eleven years a wanderer she was tired of it
She had no home and she wanted a home
Her aunther mothers widowed sisterhad taken her abroad when she was thirteen
John was able to defy or to deceive their mother
But she could and did enforce upon Gladys the rigid rules which her fanatical nature had evolveda minute and crushing tyranny
Therefore Gladys preferred any place to her home
For ten years she had been roaming western Europe nominally watched by her lazy selfish and physically and mentally nearsighted aunt
Actually her only guardian had been her own precocious curiously prudent curiously reckless self
She had been free to do as she pleased and she had pleased to do very free indeed
She had learned all that her intense and catholic curiosity craved to know had learned it of masters of her own selectingthe men and women who would naturally attract a lively young person eager to rejoice in an escape from slavery
Her eyes had peered far into the human heart farthest into the corrupted human heart yet with her innocence she had not lost her honesty or her preference for the things she had been brought up to think clean
But she had at last wearied of a novelty which lay only in changes of scene and of names without any important change in characters or plot
She began to be bored with the game of baffling the hopes inspired by her beauty and encouraged by her seeming simplicity
And when her mother cameas she said to Pauline The only bearable view of mother is a distant view
I had forgot there were such people left on earthI had thought theyd all gone to their own kind of heaven
So she fled to America to her brother and his wife
Dumont stayed eight days at the Eyrie on that trip then went back to his congenial life in New Yorkto his business and his dissipation
He tempered his indulgence in both nowadays with some exercisehis stomach his heart his nerves and his doctor had together given him a bad fright
The evening before he left he saw Pauline and Gladys sitting apart and joined them
Why not invite Scarborough to spend a week up here
he asked just glancing at his wife
He never ventured to look at her when there was any danger of their eyes meeting
Her lips tightened and the color swiftly left her cheeks and swiftly returned
Wouldnt you like it Gladys
he went on
Oh DO ask him Pauline said Gladys with enthusiasm
Like her brother she always went straight to the pointshe was in the habit of deciding for herself of thinking what she did was above criticism and of not especially caring if it was criticised
Please do
Pauline waited longit seemed to her long enough for time to wrinkle her heartbefore answering Well need another man
Ill ask himif you wish
Gladys pressed her hand gratefullyshe was fond of Pauline and Pauline was liking her again as she had when they were children and playmates and partners in the woes of John Dumonts raids upon their games
Just then Langdons sister Mrs Barrow called Gladys to the other end of the drawingroom
Dumonts glance followed her
I think itd be a good match he said reflectively
Paulines heart missed a beat and a suffocating choke contracted her throat
What
she succeeded in saying
Gladys and Scarborough replied Dumont
She ought to marryshes got no place to go
And itd be good business for herand for him too for that matter if she could land him
Dont you think shes attractive to men
Very said Pauline lifelessly
Dont you think it would be a good match
he went on
Very she said looking round wildly as her breath came more and more quickly
Langdon strolled up
Am I interrupting a family council
he asked
Oh no Dumont replied rising
Take my chair
And he was gone
This room is too warm said Pauline
No dont open the window
Excuse me a moment
She went into the hall threw a golf cape round her shoulders and stepped out on the veranda closing the doorwindow behind her
It was a moonless winter nightstars thronging the blueblack sky the steady lamp of a planet set in the southern horizon
When she had been walking there for a quarter of an hour the doorwindow opened and Langdon looked out
Ohthere you are
he said
Wont you join me
Her tone assured him that he would not be intruding
He got a hat and overcoat and they walked up and down together
Those stars irritate me he said after a while
They make me appreciate that this worlds a tiny grain of sand adrift in infinity and that Imtheres nothing little enough to express the human atom where the earths only a grain
And then they go on to taunt me with how shortlived I am and how itll soon be all over for mefor ever
A futile little insect buzzing about waiting to be crushed under the heel of the Great Executioner
Sometimes I feel that answered Pauline
But againoften as a childand since when everything has looked dark and ugly for me Ive gone where I could see them
And they seemed to draw all the fever and the fear out of me and to put there instead a sort ofnot happiness not even content butcourage
They were near the rail now she gazing into the southern sky he studying her face
It seemed to him that he had not seen any one so beautiful
She was all in black with a diamond star glittering in her hair high above her forehead
She looked like a splendid plume dropped from the starry wing of night
The stars make you feel that way he said in the light tone that disguises a compliment as a bit of raillery because youre of their family
And I feel as I do because Im a bloodrelation of the earthworms
Her face changed
Oh but so am I
she exclaimed with a passion he had never seen or suspected in her before
She drew a long breath closed her eyes and opened them very wide
You dont know you cant imagine how I long to LIVE
And KNOW what to live means
Then why dont you
he askedhe liked to catch people in their confidential moods and to peer into the hidden places in their hearts not impudently but with a sort of scientific curiosity
Because Im a daughterthats anchor number one
Because Im a motherthats anchor number two
Because Im a wifethats anchor number three
And anchor number fourbecause Im under the spell of inherited instincts that rule me though I dont in the least believe in them
Tied hands and feet
Inherited instinct
He shook his head sadly
Thats the skeleton at lifes banquet
It takes away my appetite
She laughed without mirth then sighed with some selfmockery
It frightens ME away from the table

GRADUATED PEARLS
But Scarborough declined her invitation
However he did come to dinner ten days later and Gladys who had no lack of confidence in her power to charm when and whom she chose was elated by his friendliness then and when she met him at other houses
Hes not a bit sentimental she told Pauline whose silence whenever she tried to discuss him did not discourage her
But if he ever does care for a woman hell care in the same tremendous way that he sweeps things before him in his career
Dont you think so
Yes said Pauline
She had now lingered at Saint X two months beyond the time she originally set
She told herself she had reached the limit of endurance that she must fly from the spectacle of Gladys growing intimacy with Scarborough she told Gladys it was impossible for her longer to neglect the new house in Fifth Avenue
With an effort she added Youd rather stay on here wouldnt you
I detest New York replied Gladys
And Ive never enjoyed myself in my whole life as Im enjoying it here
So she went East alone went direct to Dawn Hill their country place at Manhasset Long Island which Dumont never visited
She invited Leonora Fanshaw down to stand between her thoughts and herself
Only the society of a human being one who was lighthearted and amusing could tide her back to any sort of peace in the old lifeher books and her dogs her horseback and her drawing and her gardening
A life so full of events so empty of event
It left her hardly time for proper sleep yet it had not a single one of those vivid threads of intense and continuous interestand one of them is enough to make bright the dullest pattern that issues from the Loom
In her splendor her nearest approach to an intimacy had been with Leonora
She had no illusions about the company she was keeping in the East
To her these friends seemed in no proper sense either her friends or one anothers
Drawn together from all parts of America indeed of the world by the magnetism of millions they had known one another not at all or only slightly in the period of life when thorough friendships are made even where they had been associates as children the association had rarely been of the kind that creates friendships democratic intimacy
They had no common traditions no real classfeeling no common enthusiasmsunless the passion for keeping rich for getting richer for enjoying and displaying riches could be called enthusiasm
They were mere intimate acquaintances making small pretense of friendship having small conception of it or desire for it beyond that surface politeness which enables people whose selfish interests lie in the same direction to get on comfortably together
She divided them into two classes
There were those who like herself kept up great establishments and entertained lavishly and engaged in the courteous but fierce rivalry of fashionable ostentation
Then there were those who hung about the courts of the rich invited because they filled in the large backgrounds and contributed conversation or ideas for new amusements accepting because they loved the atmosphere of luxury which they could not afford to create for themselves
Leonora was undeniably in the latter class
But she was associated in Paulines mind with the period before her splendor
She had been friendly when Dumont was unknown beyond Saint X
The others sought herwell for the same reasons of desire for distraction and dread of boredom which made her welcome them
But Leonora she more than half believed liked her to a certain extent for herselflikes me better than I like her
And at times she was selfreproachful for being thus exceeded in selfgiving
Leonora for example told her her most intimate secrets some of them far from creditable to her
Pauline told nothing in return
She sometimes longed for a confidant or rather for some person who would understand without being told some one like Olivia but her imagination refused to picture Leonora as that kind of friend
Even more pronounced than her frankness and she was frank to her own hurt was her biting cynicismit was undeniably amusing it did not exactly inspire distrust but it put Pauline vaguely on guard
Also she was candidly mercenary and in some moods rapaciously envious
But no worse thought Pauline than so many of the others here once one gets below their surface
Besides its in a goodnatured goodhearted way
She wished Fanshaw were as rich as Leonora longed for him to be
She was glad Dumont seemed to be putting him in the way of making a fortune
He was distasteful to her because she saw that he was an illtempered sycophant under a pretense of manliness thick enough to shield him from the unobservant eyes of a world of men and women greedy of flattery and busy each with himself or herself
But for Leonoras sake she invited him
And Leonora was appreciative was witty never monotonous or commonplace most helpful in getting up entertainments and good to look atalways beautifully dressed and as fresh as if just from a bath sparkling green eyes usually with goodhumored mockery in them hard smooth glistening shoulders and arms lips a crimson line at once cold and sensuous
On a Friday in December Pauline came up from Dawn Hill and after two hours at the new house went to the jewelers to buy a wedding present for Aurora Galloway
As she was passing the counter where the superintendent had his office his assistant said Beg pardon Mrs Dumont
The necklace came in this morning
Would you like to look at it
She paused not clearly hearing him
He took a box from the safe behind him and lifted from it a magnificent necklace of graduated pearls with a huge solitaire diamond clasp
Its one of the finest we ever got together he went on
But you can see for yourself
He was flushing in the excitement of his eagerness to ingratiate himself with such a distinguished customer
Beautiful
said Pauline taking the necklace as he held it out to her
May I ask whom its for
The clerk looked puzzled then frightened as the implications of her obvious ignorance dawned upon him
OhII He almost snatched it from her dropped it into the box put on the lid
And he stood with mouth ajar and forehead beaded
Please give it to me again said Pauline coldly
I had not finished looking at it
His uneasy eyes spied the superintendent approaching
He grew scarlet then white and in an agony of terror blurted out Here comes the superintendent
I beg you Mrs Dumont dont tell him I showed it to you
Ive made some sort of a mistake
Youll ruin me if you speak of it to any one
I never thought it might be intended as a surprise to you
Indeed I wasnt supposed to know anything about it
Maybe I was mistaken His look and voice were so pitiful that Pauline replied reassuringly I understandIll say nothing
Please show me those and she pointed to a tray of unset rubies in the showcase
And when the superintendent bowing obsequiously came up himself to take charge of this important customer she was deep in the rubies which the assistant was showing her with hands that shook and fingers that blundered
She did not permit her feelings to appear until she was in her carriage again and secure from observation
The clerks theory she could not entertain for an instant contradicted as it was by the facts of eight years
She knew she had surprised Dumont
She had learned nothing new but it forced her to stare straight into the face of that which she had been ignoring that which she must continue to ignore if she was to meet the ever heavier and crueler exactions of the debt she had incurred when she betrayed her father and mother and herself
At a time when her mind was filled with bitter contrasts between what was and what might have been it brought bluntly to her the precise kind of life she was leading the precise kind of surroundings she was tolerating
Whom can he be giving such a gift
she wondered
And she had an impulse to confide in Leonora to the extent of encouraging her to hint who it was
She would certainly know
No doubt everybody knows except me
She called for her as she had promised and took her to lunch at Sherrys
But the impulse to confide died as Leonora talkedof money of ways of spending money of people who had money and those who hadnt money of people who were spending too much money of those who werent spending enough money of what she would do if she had money of what many did to get money
Money money moneyit was all of the web and most of the woof of her talk
Now it ran boldly on the surface of the pattern now it was half hid under something about art or books or plays or schemes for patronizing the poor and undermining their selfrespectbut it was always there
For the first time Leonora jarred upon her fiercelyunendurably
She listened until the sound grew indistinct became mingled with the chatter of that moneyflaunting throng
And presently the chatter seemed to her to be a maddening repetition of one word moneythe central idea in all the thought and all the action of these people
I must get away she thought or I shall cry out
And she left abruptly alleging that she must hurry to catch her train
Moneymad
her thoughts ran on
The only test of honormoney and ability and willingness to spend it
They must have money or theyre nobodies
And if they have money who cares where it came from
No one asks where the men get itwhy should any one ask where the women get it
XVI
CHOICE AMONG EVILS
A few days afterwardit was a WednesdayPauline came up to town early in the afternoon as she had an appointment with the dressmaker and was going to the opera in the evening
At the dressmakers while she waited for a fitter to return from the workroom she glanced at a newspaper spread upon the table so that its entire front page was in view
It was filled with an account of how the Woolens Monopoly had in that bitter winter advanced prices twenty to thirtyfive per cent
all along the line
From the center of the page stared a picture of John Dumontits expression peculiarly arrogant and sinister
She read the headlines only then turned from the table
But on the drive uptown she stopped the carriage at the Savoy and sent the footman to the newsstand to get the paper
She read the article throughparts of it several times
She had Langdon and Honoria Longview at dinner that night by indirect questioning she drew him on to confirm the article to describe how the Woolens Monopoly was giving the country an oldfashioned winter
On the way to the opera she was ashamed of her ermine wrap enfolding her from the slightest sense of the icy air
She did not hear the singers was hardly conscious of her surroundings
As they left the Metropolitan she threw back her wrap and sat with her neck bared to the intense cold
I say dont do that
protested Langdon
She reluctantly drew the fur about her
But when she had dropped him and then Honoria and was driving on up the avenue alone she bared her shoulders and arms againlike a silly child she said
But it gave her a certain satisfaction for she felt like one who has a secret store of food in time of famine and feasts upon it
And she sat unprotected
Is Mr Dumont in
she asked the butler as he closed the door of their palace behind her
I think he is maam
Please tell him Id like to see himin the library
She had to wait only three or four minutes before he camein smoking jacket and slippers
It was long since she had looked at him so carefully as she did then and she noted how much grosser he was the puffs under his eyes the lines of cruelty that were coming out strongly with autocratic power and the custom of receiving meek obedience
And her heart sank
Useless she said to herself
Utterly useless
And the incident of the necklace and its reminders of all she had suffered from him and through him came trooping into her mind and it seemed to her that she could not speak could not even remain in the room with him
He dropped into a chair before the open fire
Horribly cold isnt it
She moved uneasily
He slowly lighted a cigar and began to smoke it his attitude one of waiting
Ive been thinking she began at lastshe was looking reflectively into the fireabout your great talent for business and finance
You formed your big combination and because you understand everything about wool you employ more men you pay higher wages and you make the goods better than ever and at less cost
Between a third and a half cheaper he said
We employ thirty thousand more men and since we settled the last strikea grim smile that would have meant a great deal to her had she known the history of that strike and how hard he had fought before he gave inweve paid thirty per cent
higher wages
Yet the profits arewell you can imagine
And youve made millions for yourself and for those in with you
I havent developed my ideas for nothing
She paused again
It was several minutes before she went on When a doctor or a man of science or a philosopher makes a discovery thatll be a benefit to the worldshe looked at him suddenly earnest appealinghe gives it freely
And he gets honor and fame
Why shouldnt you do that John
She had forgotten herself in her subject
He smiled into the firehardly a day passed that he did not have presented to him some scheme for relieving him of the burden of his riches here was another and from such an unexpected quarter
You could be rich too
We spend twenty fifty times as much as we can possibly enjoy and you have more than we could possibly spend
Why shouldnt a man with financial genius be like men with other kinds of genius
Why should he be the only one to stay down on the level with dull moneygrubbing sordid kinds of people
Why shouldnt he have ideals
He made no reply
Indeed so earnest was she that she did not give him time but immediately went on Just think John
Instead of giving out in these charities and philanthropiesI never did believe in themtheyre bound to be more or less degrading to the people that take and when its so hard to help a friend with money without harming him how much harder it must be to help strangers
Instead of those things why not be really great
Just think John how the world would honor you and how you would feel if you used your genius to make the necessaries cheap for all these fellowbeings of ours who have such a hard time getting on
That would be real superiorityand our life now is so vain so empty
Its brutal John
What do you propose
he asked curious as always when a new idea was presented to him
And this was certainly newapparently philanthropy without expense
You are master
You can do as you please
Why not put your great combine on such a basis that it would bring an honest just return to you and the others and would pay the highest possible wages and would give the people the benefit of what your genius for manufacturing and for finance has made possible
I think we who are so comfortable and never have to think of the necessaries of life forget how much a few cents here and there mean to most people
And the things you control mean all the difference between warmth and cold between life and death John
As she talked he settled back into his chair and his face hardened into its unyielding expression
A preposterous project
Just like a good sentimental woman
Not philanthropy without expense but philanthropy at the expense both of his fortune and of his position as a master
To use his brain and his life for those ungrateful people who derided his benefactions as either contributions to the conscience fund or as indirect attempts at public bribery
He could not conceal his impatiencethough he did not venture to put it into words
If weif you and I John she hurried on leaning toward him in her earnestness had something like that to live for it might come to be very different with usandIm thinking of Gardiner most of all
Thisll ruin him some day
No one NO ONE can lead this kind of life without being dragged down without becoming selfish and sordid and cruel
You dont understand he said curtly without looking at her
I never heard of suchsuch sentimentalism
She winced and was silent sat watching his bold strong profile
Presently she said in a changed strange strained voice What I asked to see you for wasJohn wont you put the pricesat least where they were at the beginning of this dreadful winter
OhI see
he exclaimed
Youve been listening to the lies about me
READING she said her eyes flashing at the insult in the accusation that she had let people attack him to her
Well reading then he went on wondering what he had said that angered her
And he made an elaborate explanationabout the necessity of meeting fixed charges which he himself had fixed about fair share of prosperity everything more expensive the country better able to pay every one doing as we are and so on
She listened closely she had not come ignorant of the subject and she penetrated his sophistries
When he saw her expression saw he had failed to convince her into his eyes came the look she understood wellthe look that told her she would only infuriate him and bruise herself by flinging herself against the iron of his resolve
You must let me attend to my own business he ended his tone goodnatured his eyes hard
She sat staring into the fire for several minutesfrom her eyes looked a will as strong as his
Then she rose and her voice lower than before but vibrating said All round ushere in New Yorkall over this countryaway off in EuropeI can see themI can feel themSUFFERING
As you yourself said its HORRIBLY cold
She drew herself up and faced him a light in her eyes before which he visibly shrank
Yes its YOUR business
But it shant be mine or MY boys
And she left the room
In the morning she returned to Dawn Hill and arranged her affairs so that she would be free to go
Not since the spring day nearly nine years before when she began that Vergil lesson which ended in a lesson in the pitilessness of consequences that was not yet finished had her heart been so light so hopeful
In vain she reminded herself that the doing of this larger duty so imperative nevertheless endangered her father and mother
They will be proud that Im doing it she assured herself
For Gardiners sake as well as for mine theyll be glad I separated him and myself from this debased life
They willthey MUST since it is right
And already she felt the easing of the bonds that had never failed to cut deeper into the living flesh whenever she had ventured to hope that she was at last growing used to them
Free
she said to herself exultantly
She dared to exult but she did not dare to express to herself the hopes the wild incredible hopes which the very thought of freedom set to quivering deep down in her as the first warmth makes the life toss in its slumber in the planted seed
On Friday she came up to New York late in the afternoon and in the evening went to the operafor a last look round
As the lights were lowering for the rise of the curtain on the second act Leonora and her husband entered the box
She had forgotten inviting them
She gave Leonora the chair in front and took the one behindMillicent Rowland whom she herself brought had the other front seat
As her chair was midway between the two she was seeing across Leonoras shoulders
Presently Dumont came in and took the chair behind Leonoras and leaned forward his chin almost touching the slope of her neck as he talked to her in an undertone she greatly amused or pretending to be
The light from the stage fell across Leonoras bosom fell upon a magnificent string of graduated pearls clasped with a huge solitaire beyond question the string the jewelers clerk had blunderingly shown her
And there was Dumonts heavy coarse profile outlined against Leonoras cheek and throat her cynical sensuous profile showing just beyond
Open sprang a hundred doors of memory into Paulines mind was discharged avalanche after avalanche of dreadful thoughts
No
No
she protested
How infamous to think such things of my best friend
But she tried in vain to thrust suspicions accusations proofs back into the closets
Instead she sank under the flood of themsick and certain
When the lights went up she said Im feeling badly all at once
Im afraid Ill have to take you home Milly
Are you ill dear
asked Leonora
Oh nojust faint she replied in a voice which she succeeded in making fairly natural
Please dont move
Stay onyou really must
The other manShenstonehelped her and Millicent with their wraps and accompanied them to their carriage
When she had set Millicent down she drew a long breath of relief
For the first time in seven years her course lay straight before her
I must be free
she said
I must be ENTIRELY freefree before the whole worldI and my boy
The next morning in the midst of her preparations to take the tenoclock limited for the West her maid brought a note to hera copy of a National Woolens Company circular to the trade setting forth that owing to a gratifying easing in the prices for raw wool the Company are able to announce and take great pleasure in announcing a ten per cent
reduction
On the margin Dumont had scrawled To go out tomorrow and to be followed in ten days by fifteen per cent
more
Couldnt resist your appeal
Thus by the sheer luck that had so often supplemented his skill and mitigated his mistakes he had yielded to her plea just in time to confuse the issue between her and him
She read the circular and the scrawl with a sinking heart
Nevertheless I shall go
she tried to protest
True he wont send out this circular if I do
But what does it matter one infamy more or less in him
Besides he will accomplish his purpose in some other way of which I shall not know
But this was only the beginning of the battle
Punishment on punishment for an act which seemed right at the time had made her morbid distrustful of herself
And she could not conquer the dread lest her longing to be free was blinding her was luring her on to fresh calamities involving all whom she cared for all who cared for her
Whichever way she looked she could see only a choice between wrongs
To stay under the same roof with him or at Dawn Hillselfrespect put that out of the question
To free herselfhow could she when it meant sacrificing her parents and also the thousands shivering under the extortions of his monopoly
In the end she chose the course that seemed to combine the least evil with the most good
She would go to the Eyrie and the world and her father and mother would think she was absenting herself from her husband to attend to the bringing up of her boy
She would see even less of Scarborough than she saw when she was last at Saint X
That afternoon she wrote to Dumont Since we had our talk I have found out about Leonora
It is impossible for me to stay here
I shall go West tomorrow
But I shall not go to my fathers because of your circular I shall go to the Eyrie insteadat least for the present
PAULINE DUMONT
Two weeks after she was again settled at the Eyrie Langdon appeared in Saint X alleging business at the National Woolens factories there
He accepted her invitation to stay with her and devoted himself to Gladys who took up her flirtation with him precisely where she had dropped it when they bade each the other a mockmournful goodby five months before
They were so realistic that Pauline came to the satisfying conclusion that her sisterinlaw was either in earnest with Langdon or not in earnest with anybody
If she had not been avoiding Scarborough she would probably have seen Gladys real gameto use Langdon as a stalking horse for him
No doubt Scarborough like all men imagines hes above jealousy Gladys had said to herself casting her keen eyes over the situation
But there never was a man who didnt race better with a pacemaker than on an empty track
Toward the end of Langdons first week Paulines suspicions as to one of the objects of his winter trip West were confirmed by his saying quite casually Dumonts dropped Fanshaw and Leonoras talking of the stage
In fact shes gone abroad to study
When he was leaving after nearly three weeks he asked her when she was coming back East
NeverI hope she said her fingers playing with the closecropped curls of her boy standing beside her
I fancied soI fancied so replied Langdon his eyes showing that he understood her and that he knew she understood for whom he had asked
You are going to stay onat the Eyrie
I think so unless somethingdisquietingoccurs
Ive not made up my mind
Fate plays such queer tricks that Ive stopped guessing at tomorrow
What was it Miss Dumonts friend Scarborough quoted from Spinoza at Atwaters the other night
If a stone on its way from the sling through the air could speak it would say How free I am
Is that the way you feel
There came into Paulines eyes a look of pain so intense that he glanced away
We choose a path blindfold she said her tone as light as her look was dark and we must go where it goestheres no other ever afterward
But if it leads down
All the PATHS lead up she replied with a sad smile
Its the precipices that lead down
Gladys joined them and Langdon said to her Well goodby Miss Dumontdont get married till you see me
He patted the boy on the shoulder
Goodby Gardinerremember we men must always be brave and gentle with the ladies
Goodby Mrs Dumontkeep away from the precipices
And if you should want to come back to us youll have no trouble in finding us
Were a lot of slow old rotters and well be just where you left usyawning and shying at new people and at all new ideas except about clothes and gossiping about each other
And he was in the auto and off for the station
XVII TWO AND THE BARRIER
Scarborough often rode with Gladys and Pauline sometimes with Gladys alone
One afternoon in August he came expecting to go out with both
But Gladys was not well that day
She had examined her pale face and deeply circled eyes in her glass she had counseled with her maida discreetly and soothingly frank French woman
Too late to telephone him she had overruled her longing to see him and had decided that at what she hoped was his critical stage it would be wiser not to show herself to him thus even in her most becoming teagown which compelled the eyes of the beholder to a fascinating game of hide and seek with her neck and arms and the lines of her figure
And Mrs
Dumont
inquired Scarborough of the servant who brought Gladys message and note
Shes out walking sir
Scarborough rode away taking the long drive through the grounds of the Eyrie as it would save him a mile of dusty and not wellshaded highway
A few hundred yards and he was passing the sloping meadows that lay golden bronze in the sun beyond the narrow fringe of wood skirting and shielding the drive
The grass and clover had been cut
Part of it was spread where it had fallen part had been raked into little hillocks ready for the wagons
At the edge of one of these hillocks far down the slope he saw the tail of a pale blue skirt a white parasol cast upon the stubble beside it
He reined in his horse hesitated dismounted tied his bridle round a sapling
He strode across the field toward the hillock that had betrayed its secret to him
Do I interrupt
he called when he was still far enough away not to be taking her by surprise
There was no answer
He paused debating whether to call again or to turn back
But soon she was risingthe lower part of her tall narrow figure hid by the hillock the upper part revealing to him the strong stamp of that vivid individuality of hers which separated her at once from no matter what company
She had on a big garden hat trimmed just a little with summer flowers a blouse of some soft white material with even softer lace on the shoulders and in the long loose sleeves
She gave a friendly nod and glance in his direction and said Oh nonot at all
Im glad to have help in enjoying this
She was looking out toward the mists of the horizon hills
The heat of the day had passed the woods the hillocks of hay were casting long shadows on the palebronze fields
A breeze had sprung up and was lifting from the dried and drying grass and clover a keen sweet intoxicating perfumelike the odor which classic zephyrs used to shake from the flowing hair of woodland nymphs
He stood beside her without speaking looking intently at her
It was the first time he had been alone with her since the afternoon at Battle Field when she confessed her marriage and he his love
Bandit was lame she said when it seemed necessary to say something
She rode a thoroughbred Bandit who would let no one else mount him whenever she got a new saddle she herself had to help put it on so alert was he for schemes to entrap him to some others service
He obeyed her in the haughty nervous way characteristic of thoroughbredsobeyed because he felt that she was without fear and because she had the firm but gentle hand that does not fret a horse yet does not let him think for an instant that he is or can be free
Then too he had his share of the universal fundamental vanity we should probably find swelling the oyster did we but know how to interpret it and he must have appreciated what an altogether harmonious spectacle it was when he swept along with his mistress upon his back as light and free as a Valkyr
I was sorry to miss the ride Pauline went on after another pauseto her riding was the keenest of the many physical delights that are for those who have vigorous and courageous bodies and sensitive nerves
Whenever it was possible she fought out her battles with herself on horseback usually finding herself able there to drown mental distress in the surge of physical exultation
As he still did not speak she looked at himand could not look away
She had not seen that expression since their final hour together at Battle Field though in these few last months she had been remembering it so exactly had been wondering doubting whether she could not bring it to his face again had been forbidding herself to long to see it
And there it was unchanged like all the inflexible purposes that made his character and his career
And back to her came as it had come many and many a time in those years the story he had told her of his father and mother of his fathers love for his motherhow it had enfolded her from the harshness and peril of pioneer life had enfolded her in age no less than in youth had gone down into and through the Valley of the Shadow with her had not left her even at the gates of Death but had taken him on with her into the Beyond
And Pauline trembled an enormous joy thrilling through and through her
Dont
she said uncertainly
Dont look at me like that PLEASE
You were crying he said abruptly
He stood before her obviously one who had conquered the respect of the world in fair open battle and has the courage that is for those only who have tested their strength and know it will not fail them
And the sight of him the look of him filled her not with the mere belief but with the absolute conviction that no malign power in all the world or in the mystery round the world could come past him to her to harass or harm her
The doubts the sense of desolation that had so agitated her a few minutes before now seemed trivial weak unworthy
She lowered her eyesshe had thought he would not observe the slight traces of the tears she had carefully wiped away
She clasped her hands meekly and lookedand feltlike a guilty child
The coldness the haughtiness were gone from her face
Yes she said shyly
YesII She lifted her eyesher tears had made them as soft and luminous as the eyes of a child just awake from a long untroubled sleep
Butyou must not ask me
Its nothing that can be helped
Besides it seems nothingnow
She forced a faint smile
If you knew what a comfort it is to cry youd try it
I have he replied
Then after a pause he added Once
Something in his toneshe did not venture to look at him againmade her catch her breath
She instantly and instinctively knew when that once was
I dont care to try it again thank you he went on
But it made me able to understand what sort of comfort you were getting
ForYOU dont cry easily
The katydids were clamoring drowsily in the tops of the sycamores
From out of sight beyond the orchard came the monotonous musical whir of a reaper
A quail whistled his pert hopeful careless Bob White
from the rail fence edging the wheat field
A bumblebee grumbled among a cluster of swaying clover blossoms which the mower had spared
And the breeze tossed up and rolled over the meadow over the senses of the young man and the young woman great billows of that perfume which is the combined essence of all natures love philters
Pauline sank on the hay and Scarborough stretched himself on the ground at her feet
For a long time its been getting darker and darker for me she began in the tone of one who is talking of some past sorrow which casts a retreating shadow over present joy to make it the brighter by contrast
Todaythis afternoon it seemed as if the light were just about to go outfor good and all
And I came here
I found myself lying on the groundon the bosom of this old cruelkind mother of ours
And She did not finishhe would know the rest
Besides what did it matternow
He said If only there were some way in which I could help
It isnt the people who appear at the crises of ones life like the hero on the stage that really help
Im afraid the crises the real crises of real life must always be met alone
Alone he said in an undertone
The sky was blue nowcloudless blue but in that word alone he could hear the rumble of storms below the horizon storms past storms to come
The real helpers she went on are those who strengthen us day by day hour by hour
And when no physical presence would do any good when no outside aid is possibletheyits like finding a wall at ones back when ones in dread of being surrounded
I suppose you dont realize how much it means toto how many peopleto watch a man who goes straight and strong on his waywithout blustering without trampling anybody without taking any mean advantage
You dont mind my saying these things
She felt the look which she did not venture to face as he answered I needed to hear them today
For it seemed to me that I too had got to the limit of my strength
But you hadnt
She said this confidently
NoI suppose not
Ive thought so before but somehow Ive always managed to gather myself together
This time it was the work of years apparently undonehopelessly undone
Theyshe understood that they meant the leaders of the two corrupt rings whose rule of the state his power with the people menacedthey have bought away some of my best menbought them with those favors that are so much more disreputable than money because theyre respectable
Then they came to mehe laughed unpleasantlyand took me up into a high mountain and showed me all the kingdoms of the earth as it were
I could be governor senator they said could probably have the nomination for president evennot if I would fall down and worship them but if I would let them alone
I could accomplish nearly all that Ive worked so long to accomplish if I would only concede a few things to them
I could be almost free
ALMOSTthat is not free at all
She said And they knew you no better than that
Now he continued it looks as if Ill have to build all over again
I think not she replied
If they werent still afraid of you theyd never have come to you
But what does it matter
YOU dont fight for victory you fight for the fights sake
And soshe looked at him proudlyyou cant lose
Thank you
Thank you he said in a low voice
She sighed
How I envy you
You LIVE
I can simply be alive
Sometimes I feel as if I were sitting in a railway station waiting to begin my journeywaiting for a train thats latenobody knows how late
Simply alivethats all
Thats a great deal he said
He was looking round at the sky at the horizon at the fields far and near at her
A great deal he repeated
You feel that too
She smiled
I suppose I should live on through anything and everything because away down under the surface where even the worst storms cant reach theres always a sort of tremendous joythe sense of being alivejust alive
She drew a long breath
Often when Ive beenanything but happya little while ago for instanceI suddenly have a feeling of ecstasy
I say to myself Yes Im unhappy butIm ALIVE
He made a sudden impulsive movement toward her then restrained himself pressed his lips together and fell back on his elbow
I suppose I ought to be ashamed of myself she added
You mustnt say that
He was sitting up was speaking with all his energy
All that you were telling me a while ago to encourage me applies to you tooand moremore
You DO live
You ARE what you long to be
That ideal youre always trying to graspdont you know why you cant grasp it Pauline
Because its your own self your own image reflected as in a mirror
He broke off abruptly acutely conscious that he was leaning far over the barrier between them
There was a distant shout from vigorous boyish lungs
Gardiner mad with the joy of healthy seven came running and jumping across the field to land with a leap astride the hillock scattering wisps of hay over his mother and Scarborough
Pauline turned without getting up caught her boy by the arms and with mock violence shook and thrust him deep down into the damaged hillock
She seemed to be making an outlet for some happiness too great to be contained
He laughed and shouted and struggled pushed and pulled her
Her hat fell off her hair loosened and the sun showered gold of many shades upon it
She released him and stood up straightening and smoothing her hair and breathing quickly the color high in her cheeks
Scarborough was already standing watching her with an expression of great cheerfulness
Goodby he now said
The caravanhis tone was halfjesting halfserioushas been spending the heat and dust of the day on the oasis
It makes night journeys only
It must push on
Night journeys only repeated Pauline
That sounds gloomy
But there are the starsand the moon
She laughed
And other oases ahead
Goodbyand thank you
The boy close to his mother and facing Scarborough was looking from her to him and back againcuriously it almost seemed suspiciously
Both noticed it both flushed slightly
Scarborough shook hands with her bowed to the little boy with a formality and constraint that might have seemed ludicrous to an onlooker
He went toward his horse Gardiner and his mother took the course at right angles across the field in the direction in which the towers of the Eyrie could be seen above the treetops
Suddenly the boy said as if it were the conclusion of a long internal argument I like Mr
Scarborough
Why not
asked his mother amused
II dont know replied the boy
Anyhow I like him
I wish hed come and stay with us and Aunt Gladys
Gladys
The reminder made her uncomfortable made her feel that she ought to be remorseful
But she hastened on to defend herself
What reason had she to believe that Gladys cared for him except as she always cared for difficult conquest
Hadnt Gladys again and again gone out of her way to explain that she wasnt in love with him
Hadnt she said only two days before I dont believe I could fall in love with any man
Certainly I couldnt unless he had made it very clear to me that he was in love with me
Pauline had latterly been suspecting that these elaborations of superfluous protestation were Gladys efforts to curtain herself
Now she dwelt upon them with eager pleasure and assured and reassured herself that she had been supersensitive and that Gladys had really been frank and truthful with her
XVIII
ON THE FARM
On his way down the bluffs to town Scarborough felt as calm and peaceful as that tranquil evening
He had a sense of the end of a long strain of which he had until then been unconscious
NOW I can go away and rest he said to himself
And at sundown he set out for his farm
He arrived at ten oclock by moonlight amid a baying of dogs so energetic that it roused every living thing in the barnyard to protest in a peevish chorus of clucking and grunting and quacking and squealing
What on airth
exclaimed Mrs Gabbard his farmers wife standing at the back door in calico skirt and big shawl
When she saw who it was her irritated voice changed to welcome
Why howdy Mr Scarborough
I thought it was old John Lovel among the chickens or at the granary
I might a knowed he wouldnt come in the full of the moon and no clouds
Go straight back to bed Mrs Gabbard and dont mind me said Scarborough
I looked after my horse and dont want anything to eat
Wheres Eph
Cant you hear
asked Mrs Gabbard dryly
And in the pause a lusty snore penetrated
When anything out of the way happens I get up and nose around to see whether its worth while to wake him
Scarborough laughed
Ive come for a few daysto get some exercise he said
But dont wake me with the others tomorrow morning
Im away behind on sleep and dead tired
He went to bedthe rooms upstairs in front were reserved for him and were always ready
His brain was apparently as busy and as determined not to rest as on the worst of his many bad nights during the past four months
But the thoughts were vastly different and soon those millions of monotonous murmurings from brook and field and forest were soothing his senses
He slept soundly with that complete relaxing of every nerve and muscle which does not come until the mind wholly yields up its despotic control and itself plunges into slumber unfathomable
The change of the air with dawn slowly wakened him
It was only a little after five but he felt refreshed
He got himself into farm working clothes and went down to the summer diningrooma shed against the back of the house with three of its walls latticed
In the adjoining kitchen Mrs Gabbard and her daughters Sally and Bertha were washing the breakfast dishesGabbard and his two sons and the three hands had just started for the meadows with the hay wagons
Good morning said Scarborough looking in on the three women
They stopped work and smiled at him and the girls dried their hands and shook hands with himall with an absolute absence of embarrassment that to one familiar with the awkward shyness of country people would have told almost the whole story of Scarboroughs character
Ill get you some breakfast in the diningroom said Mrs Gabbard
Nojust a littleon the corner of the table out here replied Scarborough
Mrs Gabbard and Sally bustled about while he stood in the doorway of the shed looking out into the yard and watching the hens make their careful early morning tour of the inclosure to glean whatever might be there before scattering for the days excursions and depredations
He had not long to wait and he did not linger over what was served
Youve et in a manner nothing complained Mrs Gabbard
I havent earned an appetite yet he replied
Just wait till this evening
As soon as he was out of view he gave a great shout and started to run
What folly to bother with a foolish troublebreeding thinking apparatus in a world like this
he thought as the tremendous currents of vitality surged through him
And he vaulted a sixrail fence and ran on
Down the hollow drenched with dew across the brook which was really wide enough to be called a creek up the steep slope of the opposite hill at a slower pace and he was at the edge of the meadows
The sun was clear of the horizon now and the two wagons piled high with hay and poled down to keep the loads steady were about to move off to the barn
Bring back a fork for me Bill
he called to the driver of the nearer wagonBill was standing on the lofty top of his load which projected forward and rear so far that forward the horses were half canopied
Against Bills return he borrowed Gabbards fork and helped complete the other wagon the sweat streaming from his face as his broad shoulders swung down with the empty fork and up with a great mat of hay
They worked alternately in the fields and at the barns until halfpast eleven
Then they went into the shade at the edge of the meadow and had their dinner
My old woman said Gabbard says that two setdown meals a day in harvest times as many as shell stand for
So we have dinner out here in good weather and to the barn when it rains
The talk was of weather prospects of probable tonnage to the acre of the outlook for the corn of the health and family expectations of the mares and the cows and the pigs
It died away gradually as one man after another stretched out upon his back with a bunch of hay for an odorous pillow and his broadbrimmed straw hat for a lightshade
Scarborough was the fourth man to yield as he dozed off his hat was hiding that smile of boundless content which comes only to him who stretches his well body upon grass or soft stubble and feels the vigor of the earth steal up and through him
Why dont I do this oftener
Scarborough was saying to himself
I mustand I shall now that my minds more at ease
A long afternoon of the toil that tires and vexes not and at sundown he was glad to ride home on top of the last wagon instead of walking as he had intended
The suppertable was readywas spread in the diningshed
They washed their hands and sunburnt arms and soused their heads in cold water from the well and sat Scarborough at one end Gabbard at the other the strapping sons and the hands down either side
The whole meal was before themhuge platters of fried chicken great dishes full of beans and corn and potatoes plates piled high with hot corn bread other plates of saltrising Mrs Gabbards miraculous apple pies and honey for which the plundered flowers might still be mourning
Yesterday it would have seemed to Scarborough dinner enough for a regiment
Todayhe thought he could probably eat it all and wished that he might try
To drink there were coffee and cider and two kinds of milk
He tried the buttermilk and kept on with it
You must a had a busy summer said Gabbard
This is the first time youve been with us
Yes Scarborough replied
I did hope to get here for the threshing but I couldnt
The threshing set them all offit had been a record year thirtyeight bushels to the acre on the average twentyseven on the hillsides which Gabbard had hesitated whether to put in or not
An hour after supper Scarborough could no longer hold his eyes open
Wake me with the others he said to Mrs Gabbard who was making up the saltrising yeast for the morrows baking
Ill have breakfast when they do
I reckon youve earned it said Mrs Gabbard
Eph says you laid it over em all today
Well I guess I at least earned my supper replied Scarborough
And I guess I ate it
You didnt do so bad considerin Mrs Gabbard admitted
Nothin like livin in town to take appetite away
That isnt all it takes away said Scarborough going on to his own part of the house without explaining his remark
When his head touched the pillow his brain instantly stopped the machinery
He needed no croonings or dronings from the fields to soothe him
Not an idea in my head all day he said to himself with drowsy delight
Four days of this and on the fifth came the outside world in the form of Burdick chairman of the county committee of his party in the county in which his farm lay
They sat on the fence under the big maple out of earshot of the others
Larkins come out for John Frankfort for the nomination for governor said Burdick
Scarborough smiled
Even Larkin couldnt get it for Frankforthes too notorious
He dont want to get it for him replied Burdick
His real mans Judge Graney
Scarborough stopped fanning himself with his widebrimmed straw
Judge Graney was the most adroit and dangerous of John Dumonts tools
He had given invaluable aid from the bench at several of the National Woolens Companys most critical moments
Yet he had retained and increased his popularity and his reputation by deciding against his secret master with a brave show of virtue when he knew the higher courts must reverse him
For several years Scarborough had been looking forward to the inevitable open conflict between the forces of honesty in his party and the forces of the machine as ruled by the halfdozen big corporations who also ruled the machine of the opposition party
He had known that the contest must come and that he must take part in it and he had been getting ready
But he had not wished to give battle until he was strong enough to give a battle which even if he lost it would not strengthen the hold of the corruptionists
After he rejected Larkins dazzling offers conditioned upon his aloofness rather than frank subservience he had thought the whole situation over and as he hinted to Pauline had realized how apparently hopeless a fight against the machine would be just then with the people prosperous and therefore quiescent
And he had decided to stand aside for the time
He now saw that reluctance to attack Dumont had been at least a factor in this decision and he also saw that he could not delay as he had hoped
There was no escapeeither he must let his work of years be undermined and destroyed or he must give battle with all his strength and skill
He remembered what Pauline had said You cant lose
No one cant lose in this sort of fight he thought
Either WE win or therell be no victory
He sprang from the fence to the ground
Lets go to the house he said to Burdick
What you going to do
asked Burdick as they walked toward the gate where his horse and buggy were hitched
Fight of course said Scarborough
Fight Larkin and his gang in the open
Ill get exGovernor Bowen to let us use his name and canvass the state for him
Burdick shook his head sadly
It aint politics he said
Youll split the party then the partyll turn and split you
And later as they were separating Scarborough to drive to Saint X Burdick to go back to Marshaltown he said Ill help all I can in a quiet way
ButI hope youve got your cyclone cellar dug
Scarborough laughed
I havent been digging a cyclone cellar
Ive been trying to manufacture a cyclone
There were thirtythree clear days before the meeting of the convention
He wasted not an hour of them on the manufacturing towns he went to the countryto the farmers and the villagers the men who lived each man in his own house on his own soil from which he earned his own living
Up and down and across the state he went speaking organizing planning inspiringhe and the coterie of young men who looked up to him as their leader and followed him in this desperate assault as courageously as if victory were assured
Not long before the convention he paused at exJudge Bowens country place and spent two hours with him in his great quiet cool library
Isnt it inspiring Scarborough said to see so many young men in arms for a principle
The old man slowly shook his magnificent white head and smiled at the young man
Principles without leaders go begging he replied
Men rally to the standard only when the right voice calls
The right voice at the right time
He laid his hand on Scarboroughs shoulder with affection and pride
If the moment should come for you to think of it do not forget that the leader is the principle and that in this fight the leader is not Ibut you
XIX
PAULINE GOES INTO POLITICS
Larkin decided that the state convention should be held at Saint X because his machine was most perfect there
The National Woolens Company the Consolidated Pipe and Wire Company and the Indiana Oil and Gas Corporationthe three principal political corporations in the statehad their main plants there and were in complete political control
While Larkin had no fear of the Scarborough movement regarding it as a sentimental outburst in the rank and file of the party that would die away when its fomenter had been read out of the party at the convention by the regular organization still he had been in the game too long to take unnecessary chances
He felt that it would be wise to have the delegates assemble where all the surroundings would be favorable and where his ablest and confidential men could do their work in peace and quiet
The convention was to meet on the last Thursday in September
On the preceding Monday morning CulverDumonts small thin stealthy private secretaryarrived at Saint X and after making an appointment with Merriweather for halfpast twelve went out to the Eyrie to go through a lot of accumulated domestic business with Mrs Dumont
When she in a most formal and unencouraging manner invited him to stop there he eagerly accepted
Thank you so much he said effusively
To be perfectly frank Ive been tempted to invite myself
I have some valuables with me that I dont feel at all easy about
If I should be robbed it would be a very serious matter
Would it be asking too much of you to ask you to put a package in your jewel safe
Ill be glad to do it for you replied Pauline
Theres plenty of roomthe safes almost empty and its ridiculously large
My package isnt small said Culver
And on my mind it weighs tons
He reached into his large bagat sight of it Pauline had wondered why he had brought such a bag up from the hotel when his papers for her inspection were so few
He lifted out an oblong bulky package
If youll just touch that button said she James will come and show you how to get to the safe
Culver hesitated nervously
Finally he said Im making a nuisance of myself Mrs Dumont but would you mind going to the safe with me
Id much rather none of the servants knew about this
Pauline smiled and bade him follow her
They went to her private sittingroom and she showed him the safe in a small closet built into the lower part of the bookcase
You have the combination
asked Culver as he put the package away
I see that you dont lock this door often
How fortunate you spoke of it
said she
The combination is on a bit of paper in one of the little drawers
Culver found it in the first drawer he opened and handed it to her without looking at it
You mustnt let me know it said he
Ill just fix the time lock so that it wont interfere
And when he had done so he closed the safe
As he left he said I shall only bother you to let me sleep in the house
Ill be very busy all day each day Im here
When she thought he had gone he returned to add Perhaps Id better explain to you that theres fortyfive thousand dollars in cash in the package
Thats why I was so anxious for no one to know
Ill say nothing about it Pauline assured him
Larkin came down from Indianapolis the next day and registered at the Palace Hotel
As soon as he could escape from the politicians and newspaper correspondents in the hotel office he went by a devious route to a room on the floor below his own and knocking was admitted to Culver and Merriweather
He nodded to Dumonts political agent then said to Culver Youve got the dough
Yes Culver answered in his best imitation of the tone of the man of large affairs
In twenties fifties and hundreds
I hope mighty few hundreds said Larkin
The boys are kind o shy about changing hundreddollar bills
It seems to attract attention to them
He had large dreamy almost sentimental brown eyes that absurdly misrepresented his character or at least his dominant characteristics
His long slightly bent nose and sharp chin and thin tight mouth were more truthful
How do things look Joe
asked Merriweather
Yes Mr Dumont asked me to telegraph him after Id talked with you said Culver
Has Scarborough made much headway
I must say hes raised a darn sight more hell than I thought he would Larkin answered
The people seem to be in a nasty mood about corruption
Darn their fool souls as if they wouldnt be in the rottenest kind of a fix with no property and no jobs if we didnt keep the ignorant vote under control and head off such firebrands as this fellow Scarborough
Got any figgers
demanded Merriweather who had listened to this tirade with an expression suggesting cynicism
He thought and he knew Joe Larkin thought politics a mere game of chanceyou won or you didnt win and principles and oratory and likes and dislikes and resentments were so much hot air
If the oil can had been with Scarborough Merriweather would have served him as cheerfully and as loyally aswell as would Joe Larkin in those circumstances
Larkin wrenched a big bunch of letters and papers from the sagged inside pocket of his slouchy sack coat after some fumbling and sorting he paused upon the back of a dirty envelope
Heres how the convention stands to a man he said
Sure two hundred and sixtysevenby sure I mean the fellows we own outright
Safe two hundred and fortyfiveby safe I mean those thatll stand by the organization thick and thin
Insurgents two hundred and ninetyfivethose are the chaps thatve gone clean crazy with Scarborough
Doubtful three hundred and eightysixsome of em can be bought most of em are waiting to see which way the cat jumps so as to jump with her
Then weve got five hundred and twelve and it takes five hundred and ninetyseven to elect said Merriweather the instant the last word was out of Larkins mouth
Merriweather was a mite of a man could hardly have weighed more than a hundred pounds had a bulging forehead was bald and gray at the temples eyes brown as walnut juice and quick and keen as a ratterriers
His expression was the gamblerscalm watchful indifferent pallid as from years of nights under the gaslight in close hot rooms with the cards sliding from the faro box hour after hour
Eightyfive shortthats right assented Larkin
Then with a look at Culver And some of emll come mighty high
Where are you going to do business with them
inquired Merriweather
Here
Right here in this room where Ive done it manys the time before replied Larkin
Tomorrow night Conkey Sedgwick and my boy Tomll begin steerin em in one at a time about eight oclock
Then Ill turn the money over to you at seven tomorrow night said Culver
Ive got it in a safe place
Not one of the banks I hope said Merriweather
We noted your suggestions on that point and on all the others Culver answered with gracious condescension
Thats why I brought cash in small denominations and didnt go near anybody with it
Larkin rose
Ive got to get to work
See you here tomorrow night at seven Mr Culverseven sharp
I guess itll be Judge Graney on the third ballot
On the first ballot the organizationll vote solid for Graney and my fellowsll vote for John Frankfort
On the second ballot half my Frankfort crowdll switch over to Graney
On the third Ill put the rest of em over and thatll be enough to electprobably the Scarborough crowdll see its no use and let us make it unanimous
The losers are always hot for harmony
That sounds well said Merriweatherhis was a voice that left his hearers doubtful whether he meant what his words said or the reverse
Culver looked with secret admiration from one man to the other and continued to think of them and to admire after they had gone
He felt important sitting in and by proxy directing the councils of these powerful men these holders and manipulators of the secret strings whereto were attached puppet peoples and puppet politicians
Seven years behind the scenes with Dumonts most private affairs had given him a thoroughgoing contempt for the mass of mankind
Did he not sit beside the master at the innermost wheels deep at the very heart of the intricate mechanism
Did not that position make him a sort of master at any rate far superior to the princeliest puppet
At five the next afternoonthe afternoon of the day before the conventionhe was at the Eyrie and sent a servant to say to Mrs Dumont that he would like to see her
She came down to him in the library
Im only troubling you for a moment he said
Ill relieve you of my package
Very well said Pauline
I havent thought of it since day before yesterday
Ill bring it down to you
She left him in the library and went up the stairsshe had been reading everything that was published about the coming convention and the evident surprise of all the politicians at the strength Scarborough was mustering for exGovernor Bowen had put her in high good humor
She cautioned herself that he could not carry the convention but his showing was a moral victoryand what a superb personal triumph
With everything against himmoney and the machine and the skilful confusing of the issues by his crafty opponentshe had rallied about him almost all that was really intelligent in his party and he had demonstrated that he had on his side a mass of the voters large out of all proportion to the number of delegates he had wrested away from the machinenearly three hundred when everybody had supposed the machine would retain all but a handful
Money
Her lips curled scornfullyout here in her own home among these simple people the brutal power of money was master just as in New York among a people crazed by the passion for luxury and display
She was kneeling before the safe was working the combination paper in hand
The knob clicked as the rings fell into place she turned the bolt and swung the door open
She reached into the safe
Suddenly she drew her hand back and sat up on the floor looking at the package
Why its for use in the convention
she exclaimed
She did not move for several minutes when she did it was to examine the time lock to reset it to close the door and bolt it and throw the lock off the combination
Then she rose and slowly descended to the library
As she reappeared emptyhanded Culver started violently and scrutinized her face
Its expression put him in a panic
Mrs
Dumont
he exclaimed wildly
Has it been stolen
She shook her head
No she said
Its there
Trembling from weakness in the reaction he leaned against the table wiping his sweating brow with sweating hands
But she went on it must stay there
He looked openmouthed at her
You have brought the money out here for use in the convention she went on with perfect calmness
You have tried to make me a partner in that vile business
AndI refuse to play the part assigned me
I shall keep the money until the convention is over
He looked round like a terrorstricken drowning man about to sink for the last time
Im ruined
Im ruined
he almost screamed
No she said still calm
You will not be ruined though you deserve to be
But I understand why you have become callous to the commonplace decencies of life and I shall see to it that no harm comes to you
Mr Dumont willDESTROY me
You dont realize Mrs Dumont
Vast property interests are at stake on the result of this conventionthats our cause
And you are imperiling it
Imperiling a cause that needs lies and bribes to save it
she said ironically
Please calm yourself Mr Culver
You certainly cant be blamed for putting your money in a safe place
I take the responsibility for the rest
And when you tell Mr Dumont exactly what happened you will not be blamed or injured in any way
I shall telegraph him at once he warned her
Certainly said Pauline
He might blame you severely for failing to do that
He paused in his pacing up and down the room
He flung his arms toward her his eyes blazing
I WILL have it
he exclaimed
Do you hear me I WILL
Ill bring men from downtown and have the safe blown open
The money is not yoursit is She advanced to the bell
Another word Mr Culver and Ill have the servants show you the door
Yours is a strange courageto dare to speak thus to me when your head should be hanging in shame for trying to make such base use of me and my courtesy and friendliness
His arms dropped and he lowered his head
I beg your pardon he said humbly
Im not myself
I think Im going insane
PITY me
Pauline looked at him sadly
I wish I had the right to
ButI SYMPATHIZE and Im sorryso sorryto have to do this
A pause thenGood afternoon Mr
Culver
And she moved toward the door
At the threshold she turned
I must say one thing furtherTHE CONVENTION MUST NOT BE PUT OFF
If it is adjourned tomorrow without making nominations I shall understand that you are getting the money elsewhere
AndI shall be compelled to put such facts as I know in the possession ofof those you came to injure
And she was gone
Culver went to Merriweathers office and sent out for him and Larkin
When they arrived he shut the doors and told them what had happenedand in his manner there was not left a trace of the New Yorker and ambassador condescending to westerners and underlings
Larkin cursed Merriweather gave no outward sign
Presently Merriweather said Larkin you must adjourn the convention over tomorrow
Culver can go to Chicago and get back with the money by tomorrow night
No use groaned Culver
And he told them the last part of his talk with Mrs Dumont
She thought of that
said Merriweather and he looked the impartial admiration of the connoisseur of cleverness
But shed never carry out her threatnever in the world
persisted Larkin
If you had seen her when she said it and if youd known her as long as I have you wouldnt say that replied Culver
We must try to get the money here right awayat the banks
All shut said Merriweather I wonder how much cash there is at the Woolens and the Oil and Steel offices
We must get together as much as we canquietly
And he rapidly outlined a program that put all three at work within fifteen minutes
They met again at seven
Culver had twentysix hundred dollars Larkin thirtyone hundred Merriweather who had kept for himself the most difficult task had only twelve hundred
Sixtynine hundred said Merriweather eying the heap of paper in packages and silver in bags
Better than nothing suggested Culver with a pitiful attempt to be hopeful
Merriweather shrugged his shoulders
Lets get some supper he said to Culver
Then to Larkin Well Joe youll have to try promises
Will you keep this cash or shall I
You might as well keep it replied Larkin with a string of oaths
Itd be ruination to pay one without paying all
Perhaps you can use some of it between ballots tomorrow
Then sharply to Culver Youve telegraphed Mr
Dumont
Of course said Culver
And it took some time as I had to put the whole story into cipher
As Culver and Merriweather were seated with the dinner before them which Culver did not touch and which Merriweather ate placidly Culver asked him whether there was any hope at all
Theres always hope replied Merriweather
Promises especially from Joe Larkin will go a long way though they dont rouse the white hot enthusiasm that cold cash in the pocket does
Well pull through all right
He ate for a while in silence
Then This Mrs Dumont must be an uncommon woman
A few more mouthfuls and with his small icy mirthless laugh he added Ive got one something like her at home
I keep her there
Culver decided to spend the night at the hotel
He hung round the hotel office until two in the morning expecting and dreading Dumonts reply to his telegram
But nothing came either for him or for Merriweather 
Queer we dont get word of some sort isnt it
said he to Merriweather the next morning as the latter was leaving for the convention
Merriweather made no reply beyond a smile so faint that Culver barely saw it
She was right after all thought Culver less despondent
Ill get the money just before I leave and take it back
And Ill not open this subject with Dumont
Maybe hell never speak of it to me
And Dumont never did
XX
A MAN IN HIS MIGHT
Olivia came to attend the convention as Fred was a delegate from Marion County
Pauline and Gladys accepted her invitation and shared her boxthe convention was held in the Saint X Grand Opera House the second largest auditorium in the state
Pauline in the most retired corner could not see the Marion County delegation into which Scarborough went by substitution
But she had had a glimpse of him as she came inhe was sitting beside Fred Pierson and was gazing straight ahead as if lost in thought
He looked tired and worn but not cast down
You should have been here Polly when Scarborough came in said Olivia who was just in front of her
They almost tore the roof off
Hes got the audience with him even if the delegates arent
A good many of the delegates applauded too she addedbut in a significantly depressed tone
Why isnt he a candidate Mrs
Pierson
asked Gladys
They wanted him to be of course replied Olivia and I think it was a mistake that he didnt consent
But he wouldnt hear of it
He said it simply wouldnt do for him to make the fight to carry the convention for himself
He said that even if he were nominated the other side would use it against him
That seems reasonable said Gladys
But it isnt replied Olivia
He may not know it but he can lead men where they wouldnt go for his merely sending them
I suppose it was his modesty suggested Gladys
Modestys a good deal of a vice especially in a leader replied Olivia
There was an hour of dullnessroutine business reports of committees wearisome speeches
But like every one of those five thousand people Pauline was in a fever of anticipation
For while it was generally assumed that Scarborough and his friends had no chance and while Larkin was apparently carrying everything through according to program still it was impossible to conceive of such a man as Scarborough accepting defeat on test votes tamely taken
He would surely challenge
Larkin watched him uneasily wondering at what point in the proceedings the gage would be flung down
Even Merriweather could not keep still but flitted about his nervousness of body contrasting strangely with his calmness of face himself the most unquiet man in the hall he diffused quiet wherever he paused
At last came the call for nominations
When the secretary of the convention read Cass from the roll of counties a Larkin henchman rose and spoke floridly for twenty minutes on the virtues of John Frankfort put up as the Larkin drawfire the pretended candidate whose prearranged defeat was to be used on the stump as proof that Boss Larkin and his gang had been downed
At the call of Hancock County anothera secretLarkin henchman rose to eulogize that stanch foe of corporate corruption and aggression Hancock Countys favorite son the peoples judge Judge Edward Howel Graney
Then the rollcall proceeded amid steadily rising excitement which abruptly died into silence as the clerk shouted with impressive emphasis Wayne
That was the home county of the Scarborough candidate
A Wayne delegate rose and in a single sentence put exGovernor Bowen in nomination
There was a faint ripple of applause which was instantly checked
A silence of several seconds and Mr Chairman and gentle It was the voice Pauline knew so well
She could not see him but that voice seemed to make him visible to her
She caught her breath and her heart beat wildly
He got no further into seconding Bowens nomination than the middle of the fourth word
There may have been ears offended by the thunderclap which burst in that theater but those ears were not Paulines were not in Olivia Piersons box
And then came tumbling and roaring huge waves of adulation with his name shouted in voices hoarse and voices shrill like hissing foam on the triumphant crests of billows
And Pauline felt as if she were lifted from her bodily self were tossing in a delirium of ecstasy on a sea of sheer delight
And now he was on the platform borne there above the shoulders of a hundred men
He was standing pale and straight and mighty
He stretched out his hand so large and strong and somehow as honest as his eyes the tempest stilled
He was speakingwhat did he say
She hardly heard though she knew that it was of and for right and justicewhat else could that voice utter or the brain behind those proud features think
With her and with all there far more than his words it was his voice like music like magic rising and falling in thrilling inflections as it wove its spell of gold and fire
Whenever he paused there would be an instant of applausea huge hoarse thunder the call of that mysterious and awful and splendid soul of the massan instant full of that one great deep throbbing note then silence to hear him again
Scarborough had measured his taskto lift that convention from the slough of sordidness to which the wiles and bribes of Dumont and his clique had lured it to set it in the highroad of what he believed with all his intensity to be the highroad of right
Usually he spoke with feeling strongly repressed but he knew that if he was to win that day against such odds he must take those delegates by surprise and by storm must win in a suddenly descended whirlwind of passion that would engulf calculation and craft sordidness and cynicism
He made few gestures he did not move from the position he had first taken
He staked all upon his voice into it he poured all his energy all his fire all his whitehot passion for right and justice all his scorn of the base and the low
Head above heart when head is right he had often said
But when head is wrong then heart above head
And he reached for hearts that day
Five minutes and delegates and spectators were his captives
Fifteen minutes and he was riding a storm such as comes only when the fountains of the human deeps are broken up
Thirty minutes and he was riding it as its master was guiding it where he willed
In vain Larkin sought to rally delegates round the shamed but steadfast nucleus of the bribed and the bossed
In vain his orator moved an adjournment until calmness and reason shall be restored
The answer made him shrink and sink into his seat
For it was an awful deafening roll of the wardrums of that exalted passion which Scarborough had roused
The call of counties began
The third on the listBartholomewwas the first to say what the people longed to hear
A giant farmer fiery and freckled rose and in a voice like a blast from a bass horn bellowed Bartholomew casts her solid vote for Hampden Scarborough
Pauline had thought she heard that multitude speak before
But she now knew she had heard hardly more than its awakening whisper
For with the pronouncing of that name the tempest really burst
She sprang to her feet obeying the imperious inward command which made every one in that audience and most of the delegates leap up
And for ten long minutes for six hundred cyclonic seconds the people poured out their passionate adoration
At first Scarborough flung out his arms and all could see that he was shouting some sort of protest
But they would not hear him now
He had told them WHAT to do
He must let them say HOW to do it
Pauline looked out at those flaming thousands with the maddest emotions streaming like lightning from their faces
But she looked without fear
Theysheall were beside themselves but it was no frenzy for blood or for the sordid things
It was the divine madness of the soldier of the right battling for THE CAUSE in utter forgetfulness of self and selfishness
Beautiful
Beautiful
she murmured every nerve tingling
I never knew before how beautiful human beings are
Finally the rollcall could proceed
Long before it was ended the necessary votes had been cast for Scarborough and Larkin rose to move that the nomination be made unanimousLarkin beaten down in the open was not the man to die there he hastened to cover where he could resume the fight in the manner most to his liking
Again Scarborough was borne to the platform again she saw him standing therestraight and mighty but deathly pale and sadwell he might be bowed by the responsibility of that mandate given by the godinman but to be executed by and through plain men
A few broken hesitating words and he went into the wings and left the theater applause sweeping and swirling after him like a tidal wave
Pauline coming out into the open looked round her dazed
Why it was the same workaday world as before with its actions so commonplace and selfish with only its impulses fine and high
If these moments of exaltation could but last could but become the fixed order and routine of life
If high ideal and courage ruled instead of low calculation and fear
She sighed then her eyes shone
At least I have seen
she thought
At least I have lived one of those moments when the dreams come true
And human being has a new meaning for me
Two men just behind her in the crowd were talking of Scarborough
A demagogue
sneered one
A demigod retorted the other
And Pauline turned suddenly and gave him a look that astonished and dazzled him
XXI
A COYOTE AT BAY
Six weeks later on the morning after the general election Dumont awoke bubbling over with good humoras always when the world went well with him and so set the strong red currents of his body to flowing in unobstructed channels
He had not gone to bed the previous night until he had definite news from Indiana Illinois and New York the three states in which his industrialpolitical stakes were heaviest
They had gone as he wished as he and his friends had spent large sums of money to assist them to go
And now a glance at the morning papers confirmed his midnight bulletins
Indiana where he had made the strongest efforts because the control of its statute book was vital to him had gone his way barely but apparently securely Scarborough was beaten for governor by twentyfive hundred
Presently he had Culver in to begin the days business
The first paper Culver handed him was a cipher telegram announcing the closing of an agreement which made the National Woolens Company absolute in the Northwest the second item in Culvers budget was also a cipher telegramfrom Merriweather
It had been filed at four oclockseveral hours later than the newspaper despatches
It said that Scarboroughs friends conceded his defeat that the Legislature was safely Dumonts way in both houses
Culver always sorted out to present first the agreeable part of the mornings budget never had he been more successful
At the office Dumont found another cipher telegram from Merriweather Later returns show Scarborough elected by a narrow majority
But he will be powerless as Legislature and all other state offices are with us
Dumont crushed the telegram in his hand
Powerlesshell
he muttered
Does he think Im a fool
He had spent three hundred thousand dollars to protect his monopoly in its home for it was under Indiana laws as interpreted by Dumonts agents in public office that the main or holding corporation of his group was organized
And he knew that in spite of his judges and his attorneygeneral and his legislative lobby and his resourceful lawyers and his subsidized newspapers a governor of Scarboroughs courage and sagacity could harass him could force his tools in public office to activity against him might drive him from the state
Heretofore he had felt and had been secure in the might of his millions
But now He had a feeling of dread close kin to fear as he measured this peril this man strong with a strength against which money and intrigue were as futile as bow and arrow against rifle
He opened the door into the room where his twenty personal clerks were at work
They glanced at his face winced bent to their tasks
They knew that expression it meant J D will take the hide off every one who goes near him today
Tell Mr Giddings I want to see him he snapped lifting the head of the nearest clerk with a glance like an electric shock
The clerk rose tiptoed away to the office of the first vicepresident of the Woolens Trust
He came tiptoeing back to say in a faint deprecating voice Mr Giddings isnt down yet sir
Dumont rolled out a volley of violent language about Giddings
In his tantrums he had no more regard for the dignity of his chief lieutenants themselves rich men and middleaged or old than he had for his office boys
To the Ineffable Grand Turk what noteworthy distinction is there between vizier and sandalstrapper
Send him inquickyou as soon as he comes he shouted in conclusion
If he had not paid generously if his lieutenants had not been coining huge dividends out of his brains and commercial audacity if his magnetic confidenceinspiring personality had not created in the minds of all about him visions of golden rivers widening into golden oceans he would have been deserted and execrated
As it was his service was eagerly sought and his servants endured its mental and moral hardships as the prospector endures the physical cruelties of the mountain fastnesses
He was closing his private door when the doorboy from the outermost of that maze of handsome offices came up to him with a card
Not here he growled and shut himself in
Half an hour later the sounds of an angry tumult in the clerks room made him fling his door open
What the he began his heavy face purple then stopped amazed
The outside doorkeeper the watchman and several clerks were engaged in a struggle with Fanshaw
His hat was off his hair wild his necktie shirt and coat awry
There you are nowI knew you were in he shouted as he caught sight of Dumont
Call these curs off Jack
Let him alone snarled Dumont
Fanshaw was released
He advanced into Dumonts office straightening his clothing and panting with exertion excitement and anger
Dumont closed the door
Well he said surlily
What d you want
Ill have to go to the wall at halfpast ten if you dont help me out said Fanshaw
The Montana election went against my crowdIm in the copper deal
Theres a slump but the stocks dead sure to go up within a week
In trouble again
sneered Dumont
Its been only three months since I pulled you through
You didnt lose anything by it did you
retorted Fanshawhe had recovered himself and was eying Dumont with the cool steady significant stare of one rascal at another whom he thinks he has in his power
Before that look Dumont flushed an angrier red
I wont do it again
and he brought his fist down with a bang
All I want is five hundred thousand to carry my copper for a week at the outside
If I get it Ill clear a million
If I dontFanshaw shrugged his shouldersIll be cleaned out
He looked with narrowed shifting eyes at Dumont
My wife has all shes got in this he went on even her jewels
Dumonts look shot straight into Fanshaws
Not a cent
he said with vicious emphasis
Not a red
Fanshaw paled and pinched in his lips
Im a desperate man
Im ruined
Leonora Dumont shook his head the veins swelling in his forehead and neck
The last strand of his selfrestraint snapped
Leave her out of this
She has no claim on me NOWand YOU never had
Fanshaw stared at him then sprang to his feet all in a blaze
You scoundrel
he shouted shaking his fist under Dumonts nose
If you dont clear out instantly Ill have you thrown out said Dumont
He was cool and watchful now
Fanshaw folded his arms and looked down at him with the dignified fury of the betrayed and outraged
So
he exclaimed
I see it all
Dumont pressed an electric button then leaned back in his revolving chair and surveyed Fanshaw tranquilly
Not a cent
he repeated a cruel smile in his eyes and round his mouth
The boy came and Dumont said to him Send the watchman
Fanshaw drew himself up
I shall punish you he said
Your wealth will not save you
And he stalked past the gaping office boy
He stood in front of the Edison Building looking aimlessly up and down the street as he pulled his long narrow browngray mustache
Gloom was in his face and hate in his heartnot hate for Dumont alone but hate for all who were what he longed to be all rich and successful men
And the towering steel and stone palaces of prosperity sneered down on him with crushing mockery
Damn them all
he muttered
The coldhearted thieves
From his entry into that district he had played a gambling game had played it dishonestly in a small way
Again and again he had sneakingly violated Wall Streets code of moralitythat curious code with its quaint unexpected incorporations of parts of the decalogue and its quainter though not so unexpected infringements thereof and amendments thereto
Now by pull now by trickery he had evaded punishment
But apparently at last he was to be brought to bar branded and banished
Damn them all
he repeated
Theyre a pack of wolves
Theyve got me down and theyre going to eat me
He blamed Dumont and he blamed his wife for his plightand there was some justice in both accusations
Twenty years before he had come down to the Street a franklooking boy of an old and distinguished New York family that had become too aristocratic for business and had therefore lost its hold upon its once great fortune
He was neither a good boy nor a bad
But he was weak and had the extravagant tastes and cynical morals to which he had been bred and his intelligent brain was of the kind that goes with weaknessshrewd and sly preferring to slink along the byways of craft even when the highway of courage lies straight and easy
But he had physical bravery and the selfconfidence that is based upon an assured social position in a community where social position is worshiped so he passed for manly and proud when he was in reality neither
Family vanity he had personal pride he had not
In many environments his weakness would have remained hidden even from himself and he would have lived and died in the odor and complacence of respectability
But not in the strain and stress of Wall Street
There he had naturally developed not into a lion not even into a wolf but into a coyote
Wall Street found him out in ten yearsabout one year after it began to take note of him and his skulking ways and his habit of prowling in the wake of the pack
Only his adroit use of his family connections and social position saved him from being trampled to death by the wolves and eaten by his brother coyotes
Thereafter he lived precariously but on the whole sumptuously upon carcasses of one kind and another
He participated in strike suits against big corporationshe would set on a pack of coyotes to dog the lions and to raise discordant howls that inopportunely centered public attention upon leonine lawless doings the lions would pay him well to call off the pack
He assisted sometimes wolves and sometimes coyotes in flotations of worthless or almost worthless stocks and bonds from gold and mahogany offices and upon a sea of glittering prospectuses
He had a hand in all manner of small shady transactions of lawful or almost lawful swindling that were tolerated by lions and wolves because at bottom there is a feeling of fellowship among creatures of prey as against creatures preyed upon
There were days when he came home haggard and blue in the lips to tell Leonora that he must fly
There were days when he returned from the chase or rather from the skulk elated youthful his pockets full of money and his imagination afire with hopes of substantial wealth
But his course was steadily downward his methods steadily farther and farther from the line of the law
Dumont came just in time to save him came to build him up from the most shunned of coyotes into a deceptive imitation of a wolf with aspirations toward the lion class
Leonora knew that he was small but she thought all men smallshe had supreme contempt for her own sex and it seemed to her that men must be even less worthy of respect since they were under the influence of women and lavished time and money on them
Thus she was deceived into cherishing the hope that her husband small and timid though he was would expand into a multimillionaire and would help her to possess the splendors she now enjoyed at the expense of her associates whom she despised
She was always thinking how far more impressive than their splendor her magnificence would be if their money were added to her brains and beauty
Dumont had helped Fanshaw as much as he could
He immediately detected the coyote
He knew it was impossible to make a lion or even a wolf out of one who was both small and crooked
He used him only in minor matters chiefly in doing queer dark things on the market with National Woolens things he indirectly ordered done but refused to know the details of beyond the one important detailthe record of checks for the profits in his bank account
For such matters Fanshaw did as well as another
But as Dumont became less of a wolf and more of a lion less of a speculator and more of a financier he had less and less work of the kind Fanshaw could do
But Leonora unaware of her husbands worthlessness and desperate in her calamities sneered and jeered and lashed him onto ruin
The coyote could put on the airs of a lion so long as the lion was his friend and protector when he kept on in kingly ways after the lion had cast him off he speedily came to grief
As he stood looking helplessly up and down Broad Street he was debating what move to make
There were about even measures of truth and falsehood in his statement to Dumonthe did need two hundred thousand dollars and he must have it before a quarter past two that day or go into a bankruptcy from which he could not hope to save a shred of reputation or to secrete more than fifty thousand dollars
To the New York Life Building he finally said to the driver as he got into his hansom
Then to himself Ill have a go at old Herron
He knew that Dumont and Herron had quarreled and that Herron had sold out of the National Woolens Company
But he did not know that Herron was a man with a fixed idea hatred of Dumont and a fixed purpose to damage him at every opportunity that offered or could be created to ruin him if possible
When the National Woolens Company was expanded into the huge conglomerate it now wasa hundred millions common a hundred millions preferred and twenty millions of bondsHerron had devised and directed the intricate and highly perilous course among the rocks of law and public opinion in many states and in the nation
It was a splendid exhibition of legal piloting and he was bitterly dissatisfied with the modest reward of ten millions of the preferred stock which Dumont apportioned to him
He felt that that would have been about his just share in the new concern merely in exchange for his stock in the old
When he found Dumont obdurate and grew frank and spoke such words as dishonor and dishonesty and got into the first syllable of swindling Dumont cut him off with If you dont like it get out
I can hire that sort of work for half what Ive paid you
Youre swollen with vanity
We ought to have a young man in your position anyhow
Herron might have swallowed the insult to his pride as a lawyer
But the insult to his pride in his youth
He was fiftyseven and in dress and in expression was stoutly insisting that he was still a young man whom hard work had made prematurely gray and somewhat wrinkled
Dumonts insinuation that he was old and stale set a great fire of hate blazing he of course told himself and others that his wrath was stirred solely because his sense of justice had been outraged by the swindling
Fanshaw entered Herrons office wearing the jaunty air of arrogant prosperity never so important as when prosperity has fled
But Herrons shrewd experienced eyes penetrated the sham
He had intended to be cold
Scenting a hardluck yarn and a touch he lowered his temperature to the point at which conversation is icebeset and confidences are frozen tight
Fanshaws nerve deserted him
Herron he said dropping his prosperous pose I want to get a divorce and I want to punish Dumont
Herrons narrow cold face lighted up
He knew what everybody in their set knew of Fanshaws domestic affairs but like everybody else he had pretended not to know
He changed his expression to one of shock and indignation
You astound me
he exclaimed
It is incredible
He told me himself not an hour ago said Fanshaw
I went to him as a friend to ask him to help me out of a hole
And He rose and theatrically paced the floor
Herron prided himself upon his acute conscience and his nice sense of honor
He felt that here was a chance to wreak vengeance upon Dumontor rather as he put it to himself to bring Dumont to an accounting for his depravity
Just as Dumont maintained with himself a character of honesty by ignoring all the dubious acts which his agents were forced to do in carrying out his orders so Herron kept peace with a far more sensitive conscience by never permitting it to look in upon his mind or out through his eyes
Frightful
Frightful
he exclaimed after a long pause in which his immured and blindfold conscience decided that he could afford to support Fanshaw
I knew he was a rascal in businessbut THIS
There was genuine emotion in his voice and in his mind
He was strict to puritanic primness in his ideals of feminine morality nor had he been relaxed by having a handsome wife looking scarce a day over thirty behind her veil or in artificial light and fond of gathering about her young men who treated him as if he were old and didnt count
You are certain Fanshaw
I tell you he hinted it himself replied Fanshaw
And instantly my eyes were opened to scores of damning confirmations
He struck his forehead with his open hand
How blind Ive been
he exclaimed
Herron shook his head sympathetically and hastened on to business
WE cant handle your case he said
But Best and Sharpless on the floor above are reliable
And Ill be glad to help you with advice
I feel that this is the beginning of Dumonts end
I knew such insolent wickedness could not have a long course
Fanshaw drew Herron on to tell the story of his wrongsthe swindling
Before it was ended Fanshaw saw that he had found a man who hated Dumont malignantly and was thirsting for vengeance
This encouraged him to unfold his financial difficulties
Herron listened sympathetically asked ingeniously illuminating questions and in the end agreed to tide him over
He had assured himself that Fanshaw had simply undertaken too large an enterprise the advance would be well secured he would make the loan in such a way that he would get a sure profit and would also bind Fanshaw firmly to him without binding himself to Fanshaw
BesidesIt wouldnt do for him to go to the wall just now
Arm in arm they went up to Best and Sharpless to take the first steps in the suit
Together they went downtown to relieve Fanshaw of the pressure of the too heavy burden of copper stocks then up to their club where he assisted Fanshaw in composing the breakingoff letter to Leonora

STORMS IN THE WEST
While the FanshawHerron storm was slowly gathering in Dumonts eastern horizon two others equally black were lifting in the west
In the two months between Scarboroughs election and his inauguration the great monopolies thriving under the protection of the states corrupted statutebook and corrupted officials followed the lead of their leader Dumonts National Woolens Company in making sweeping but stealthy changes in their prices wages methods and even in their legal status
They hoped thus to enable their Legislature plausibly to resist Scarboroughs demand for a revision of the lawswhy revise when the cry of monopoly had been shown to be a false issue raised by a demagogue to discredit the tried leaders of the party and to aggrandize himself
And when Scarborough had been thoroughly exposed business could be resumed gradually
But Scarborough had the better brain and had character as well
He easily upset their program and pressed their Legislature so hard that it was kept in line only by pouring out money like water
This became a public scandal which made him stronger than ever and also made it seem difficult or impossible for the monopolies to get a corruptible Legislature at the next election
At last the people had in their service a lawyer equal in ability to the best the monopolies could buy and one who understood human nature and political machinery to boot
Dumont began to respect Scarborough profoundlynot for his character which made him impregnable with the people but for his intellect which showed him how to convince the people of his character and to keep them convinced
When Merriweather came on to take his beating from his employer he said among other things deprecatory Scarboroughs a dreamer
His heads among the clouds
Dumont retorted Yes but his feet are on the groundtoo damned firmly to suit me
And after a moments thought he added What a shame for such a brain to go to waste
Why he could make millions
He felt that Gladys was probably his best remaining card
She had been in Indianapolis visiting the whole of February Scarboroughs second month as governor and had gone on to her brother in New York with a glowing report of her progress with Scarboroughs sister Arabella now a widow and at her own invitation living with him in Indianapolis to relieve him of the social duties of his office
She was a dozen years more the Arabella who had roused her fathers wrath by her plans for educating her brother like a gentleman and Olivia and Fred were irritated and even alarmed by her anything but helpful peculiaritiesthough Scarborough seemed cheerful and indifferent enough about them
It was a temperamental impossibility for Dumont to believe that Scarborough could really be sincere in a course which was obviously unprofitable
Therefore he attached even more importance to Arabellas cordiality than did Gladys herself
And when the Legislature adjourned and Scarborough returned to Saint X for a brief stay Dumont sent Gladys posthaste back to the Eyriethat is she instantly and eagerly acted upon his hint
A few evenings after her return she and Pauline were on the south veranda alone in the starlight
She was in low spirits and presently began to rail against her lot
Dont be absurd said Pauline
Youve no right to complain
You have everythingand yourefree
That word free was often on Paulines lips in those days
And a close observer might have been struck by the tone in which she uttered it
Not the careless tone of those who have never had or have never lost freedom but the lingering longing tone of those who have had it and have learned to value it through long years without it
Yeseverything
replied Gladys bitterly
Everything except the one thing I want
Pauline did not help her but she was at the stage of suppressed feeling where desire to confide is stronger than pride
The one thing I want she repeated
Pauline I used to think Id never care much for any man except to like it for him to like me
Men have always been a sort of amusementand the oftener the man changed the better the fun
Ive known for several years that I simply must marry but Ive refused to face it
It seemed to me I was fated to wander the earth homeless begging from door to door for leave to come in and rest a while
You know perfectly well Gladys that this is your home
Of coursein a sense
Its as much my home as another womans house could be
Butwith a little sobIve seen my mate and I want to begin my nest
They were side by side on a wide wicker sofa
Pauline made an impulsive move to put her arm round Gladys then drew away and clasped her hands tightly in her lap
Gladys was crying sobbing brokenly apologizing for itIm a little idiotbut I cant help itI havent any pride lefta woman never does have really when shes in loveoh Pauline do you think he cares at all for me
And after a pause she went on too absorbed in herself to observe Pauline or to wonder at her silence Sometimes I think he does
Again I fear thatthat he doesnt
And latelywhy doesnt he come here any more
You know how busy he is said Pauline in a voice so strained that Gladys ought to have noticed it
But it isnt thatIm sure it isnt
No it has something to do with me
It means either that he doesnt care for me or thatthat he does care and is fighting against it
Oh I dont know what to think
Then after a pause How I hate being a woman
If I were a man I could find out the truthsettle it one way or the other
But I must sit dumb and wait and wait and wait
You dont know how I love him she said brokenly burying her face in the ends of the soft white shawl that was flung about her bare shoulders
I cant help ithes the besthe makes all the others look and talk like cheap imitations
Hes the best and a woman cant help wanting the best
Pauline rose and leaned against the railingshe could evade the truth no longer
Gladys was in love with Scarborough was at last caught in her own toils would go on entangling herself deeper and deeper abandoning herself more and more to a hopeless love unless What would you do Pauline
pleaded Gladys
There must be some reason why he doesnt speak
It isnt fair to meit isnt fair
I could stand anythingeven giving him upbetter than this uncertainty
Itsits breaking my heartI who thought I didnt have a heart
No it isnt fair said Pauline to herself rather than to Gladys
I suppose you dont sympathize with me Gladys went on
I know you dont like him
Ive noticed how strained and distant you are toward each other
And you seem to avoid each other
And hell never talk of you to me
Did you have some sort of misunderstanding at college
Yes said Pauline slowly
Aa misunderstanding
And you both remember it after all these years
Yes said Pauline
How relentless you are said Gladys and how tenacious
But she was too intent upon her own affairs to pursue a subject which seemed to lead away from them
Presently she rose
Ill be ashamed of having confessed when I see you in daylight
But I dont care
I shant be sorry
I feel a little better
After all why should I be ashamed of any one knowing I care for him
And she sighed laughed went into the house whistling softlysad depressed but hopeful feeling deep down that she surely must win where she had never known what it was to lose
Pauline looked after her
No it isnt fair she repeated
She stayed on the veranda walking slowly to and fro not to make up her mind for she had done that while Gladys was confessing but to decide how she could best accomplish what she saw she must now no longer delay
It was not until two hours later that she went up to bed
When Gladys came down at nine the next morning Pauline had just gone outI think Miss Gladys she told the coachman to drive to her fathers said the butler
Gladys set out alone
Instead of keeping to the paths and the woods along the edge of the bluff she descended to the valley and the river road
She walked rapidly her face glowing her eyes sparklingshe was quick to respond to impressions through the senses and today she felt so well physically that it reacted upon her mind and forced her spirits up
At the turn beyond Deer Creek bridge she met Scarborough suddenly
He too was afoot and alone and his greeting was interpreted to her hopes by her spirits
May I turn and walk with you
he asked
Im finding myself disagreeable company today
You did look dull she said as they set out together dull as a lovesick German
But I supposed it was your executive pose
I was thinking that Ill be old before I know it
His oldyoung face was shadowed for an instant
Oldthats an unpleasant thought isnt it
Unpleasant for a man said Gladys with a laugh light as youths dread of age
For a woman ghastly
Old and aloneeither ones dreadful enough
Butthe two together
I often think of them
Dont laugh at mereally I do
Dont you
If you keep to that our walkll be a dismal failure
Its a road I never takeif I can help it
You dont look as though you were ever gloomy
Gladys glanced up at him admiringly
I should have said you were one person the blue devils wouldnt dare attack
Yes but they do
And sometimes they throw me
And trample you
And trample me he answered absently
Thats because youre alone too much she said with a look of tactful sympathy
Precisely he replied
But how am I to prevent that
Marry of course she retorted smiling gaily up at him letting her heart just peep from her eyes
Thank you
And it sounds so easy
May I ask why youve refused to take your own medicineyou who say you are so often blue
She shrugged her shoulders
Ive always suspected the men who asked me
They were She did not finish what she feared might be an unwise repelling remark in the circumstances
They were after your money he finished for her
She nodded
They were Europeans she explained
Europeans want money when they marry
Thats another of the curses of riches he said judicially
And if you marry a rich man over here you may be pretty sure hell marry you for your money
Ive observed that rich men attach an exaggerated importance to money always
Id prefer to marry a poor man she hastened to answer her heart beating fastercertainly his warning against rich suitors must have been designed to help his own cause with her
Yes that might be better he agreed
But you would have to be careful after you were married or he might fancy you were using your money to tyrannize over him
Ive noticed that the poor husbands of rich women are supersensitiveoften for cause
Oh Id give it all to him
He could do what he pleased with it
Id not care so long as we were happy
Scarborough liked the spirit of this liked her look as she said it
Thats very generousvery like you he replied warmly
But I dont think it would be at all wise
Youd be in a dangerous position
You might spoil himgreat wealth is a great danger and when its suddenly acquired and so easily No youd better put your wealth aside and only use so much of it as will make your income equal to hisif you can stand living economically
I could stand anything with or from any one I cared for
Gladys was eager for the conversation to turn from the general to the particular
She went on forcing her voice to hide her interest And you why dont you cure your blues
Oh I shall he replied carelessly
But not with your medicine
Every one to his own prescription
And whats yours for yourself
said Gladys feeling tired and nervous from the strain of this delayed happiness
Mine
He laughed
My dreams
You are a strange combination arent you
In one way youre so very practicalwith your politics and all that
And in another wayI suspect you of being sentimentalalmost romantic
Youve plucked out the heart of my mystery
My real name is non Quixote de Saint X
And has your Dulcinea red hands and a flat nose and freckles like the lady of Toboso
Gladys hands were white her nose notably fine her skin transparently clear
Being Don Quixote I dont know it if she has
And you prefer to worship afar and to send her news of your triumphs instead of going to her yourself
I dare not go
He was looking away far away
There are wicked enchanters
Im powerless
She alone can break their spells
They walked in silence her heart beating so loudly that she thought he must be hearing it must be hearing what it was saying
Yesshe must break the spells
But howbut how
What must she say to make him see
Did he expect her to ask him to marry her
She had heard that rich women often were forced to make this concession to the pride of the men they wished to marry
On the other hand was there ever a man less likely than Scarborough to let any obstacle stand between him and what he wanted
The first huge drops of a summer rain pattered in big round stains brown upon the white of the road
He glanced upa cloud was rolling from beyond the cliffs was swiftly curtaining the blue
Come he commanded and they darted into the underbrush he guiding her by her arm
A short dash among the trees and bushes and they were at the base of the bluff were shielded by a shelf of rock
Itll be over soon he assured her
But you must stand close or youll be drenched
A clap of thunder deafened them as a flame and a force enswathed the sycamore tree a few yards away blowing off its bark scattering its branches making it all in an instant a blackened and blasted wreck
Gladys gave a low scream of terror fell against him hid her face in his shoulder
She was trembling violently
He put his arm round herif he had not supported her she would have fallen
She leaned against him clinging to him so that he felt the beat of her heart the swell and fall of her bosom felt the rush of her young blood through her veins felt the thrill from her smooth delicate olive skin
And he too was tremblingshaken in all his nerves
Dont be afraid he saidin his voice he unconsciously betrayed the impulse that was fighting for possession of him
She drew herself closer to him with a long tremulous sigh
Im a coward she murmured
Im shaking so that I cant stand
She tried to draw herself awayor did she only make pretense to him and to herself that she was tryingthen relaxed again into his arms
The thunder cracked and crashed the lightnings leaped in streaks and in sheets the waters gushed from the torn clouds and obscured the light like a heavy veil
She looked up at him in the dimnessshe too was drunk with the delirium of the storms raging without and within them
His brain swam giddily
The points of gold in her dark eyes were drawing him like so many powerful magnets
Their lips met and he caught her up in his arms
And for a moment all the fire of his intensely masculine nature so long repressed raged over her lips her eyes her hair her cheeks her chin
A moment she lay happy as a petrel beaten by a tempest a moment her thirsty heart drank in the ecstasy of the lightnings through her lips and skin and hair
She opened her eyes to find out why there was a sudden calm
She saw him staring with set white face through the rainveil
His arms still held her but where they had been like the clasp of life itself they were now dead as the arms of a statue
A feeling of cold chilled her skin trickled icily in and in
She released herselfhe did not oppose her
It seems to me Ill never be able to look youor myselfin the face again he said at last
I didnt know it was in me toto take advantage of a womans helplessness
I wanted you to do what you did she said simply
He shook his head
You are generous he answered
But I deserve nothing but your contempt
I wanted you to do it she repeated
She was under the spell of her love and of his touch
She was clutching to save what she could was desperately hoping it might not be so little as she feared
I had thethe same impulse that you had
She looked at him timidly with a pleading smile
And please dont say youre sorry you did it even if you feel so
Youll think me very boldI know it isnt proper for young women to make such admissions
Butdont reproach yourselfplease
If she could have looked into his mind as he stood there crushed and degraded in his own eyes she would have been a little consoledfor in defiance of his selfscorn and selfhate his nerves were tingling with the memory of that delirium and his brain was throbbing with the surge of impulses long dormant now imperious
But she was not even looking toward himfor through her sense of shame of wounded pride her love was clamoring to her to cry out Take me in your arms again
I care not on what terms only take me and hold me and kiss me
The rain presently ceased as abruptly as it had begun and they returned under the dripping leaves to the highroad
She glanced anxiously at him as they walked toward the town but he did not speak
She saw that if the silence was to be broken she must break it
What can I say to convince you
she asked as if not he but she were the offender
He did not answer
Wont you look at me please
He looked the color mounting in his cheeks his eyes unsteady
Now tell me youll not make me suffer because you fancy youve wronged me
Isnt it ungallant of you to act this way after Ive humiliated myself to confess I didnt mind
Thank you he said humbly and looked away
You wont have it that I was in the least responsible
She was teasing him nowhe was plainly unaware of the meaning of her yielding
Hes so modest she thought and went on You wont permit me to flatter myself I was a temptation too strong even for your iron heart Don Quixote
He flushed scarlet and the suspicion the realization of the truth set her eyes to flashing
Its before another woman hes abasing himself she thought not before me
He isnt even thinking of me
When she spoke her tone was cold and sneering I hope she will forgive you
She certainly would if she could know what a paladin you are
He winced but did not answer
At the road up the bluffs she paused and there was an embarrassed silence
Then he poured out abrupt sentences It was doubly base
I betrayed your friendly trust I was false to her
Dont misunderstandshes nothing to me
Shes nothing to me yet everything
I began really to live when I began to love her
Andevery one must have aa polestar
And shes minethe star I sail by and always must
And He halted altogether then blundered on I shall not forgive myself
But yoube mercifulforgive meforget it
I shall do neither she replied curtly jealousy and vanity stamping down the generous impulse that rose in response to his appeal
And she went up her road
A few yards and she paused hoping to hear him coming after her
A few yards more and she sat down on a big boulder by the wayside
Until now all the wishes of her life had been more or less material had been wishes which her wealth or the position her wealth gave had enabled her instantly to gratify
She buried her face in her arms and sobbed and rocked herself to and fro in a cyclone of anger and jealousy and shame and love and despair
I hate him
she exclaimed between clenched teeth
I hate him butif he came and wanted me oh how I would LOVE him
Meanwhile Pauline was at her fathers
He isnt down yet said her mother
You know he doesnt finish dressing nowadays until he has read the papers and his mail
Then he walks in the garden
Ill go there said Pauline
Wont you bring him when hes ready
She never entered the garden that the ghosts of her childhoodhow far far it seemeddid not join her brushing against her or rustling in tree and bush and leafy trellis
She paused at the end of the long arbor and sat on the rustic bench there
A few feet away was the bed of liliesofthevalley
Every spring of her childhood she used to run from the house on the first warm morning and hurry to it and if her glance raised her hopes she would kneel upon the young grass and lower her head until her long golden hair touched the black ground and the soil that had been hard and cold all winter would be cracked open this way and that and from the cracks would issue an odorthe odor of life
And as she would peer into each crack in turn she would see down away down the pale tip of what she knew to be an upshooting slender shaft
And her heart would thrill with joy for she knew that the shafts would presently rise green above the black earth would unfold would blossom would bloom would fling from tremulous bells a perfumed proclamation of the arrival of spring
As she sat waiting it seemed to her that through the black earth of her life she could see and feel the backward heralds of her springafter the long winter she said to herself
She glanced upher father coming toward her
He was alone was holding a folded letter uncertainly in his hand
He looked at her his eyes full of pity and grief
Pauline he began has everything beenbeen wellof late between you andyour husband
She started
No father she replied
Then looking at him with clear directness Ive not been showing you and mother the truth about John and menot for a long time
She saw that her answer relieved him
He hesitated held out the letter
The best way is for you to read it he said
It was a letter to him from Fanshaw
He was writing he explained because the discharge of a painful duty to himself would compel him to give pain to your daughter whom I esteem highly and he thought it only right to prepare her and her family for what was coming in order that they might be ready to take the action that would suggest itself
And he went on to relate his domestic troubles and his impending suit
Poor Leonora
murmured Pauline as she finished and sat thinking of all that Fanshaws letter involved
Is it true Polly
asked her father
She gave a great sigh of relief
How easy this letter had made all that she had been dreading
Yesits true she replied
Ive known aboutabout it ever since the time I came back from the East and didnt return
The habitual pallor of her fathers face changed to gray
I left him father
She lifted her head impatient of her stammering
A bright flush was in her face as she went on rapidly And I came today to tell you the whole storyto be truthful and honest again
Im sick of deception and evasion
I cant stand it any longerI mustnt
Iyou dont know how Ive shrunk from wounding mother and you
But Ive no choice now
Father I must be freefree
And you shall be replied her father
He shall not wreck your life and Gardiners
Pauline stared at him
Father
she exclaimed
He put his arm round her and drew her gently to him
I know the idea is repellent he said as if he were trying to persuade a child
But its right Pauline
There are cases in which not to divorce would be a sin
I hope my daughter sees that this is one
I dont understand she said confusedly
I thought you and mother believed divorce was dreadfulno matter what might happen
We did Pauline
But wethat is Ihad never had it brought home
A hint of this story was published just after you came last year
I thought it false but it set me to thinking
If your daughters husband had turned out to be as you once thought him would it be right for her to live on with him
To live a lie to pretend to keep her vows to love and honor him
Would it be right to condemn Gardiner to be poisoned by such a father
And at last I saw the truth and your mother agreed with me
We had been too narrow
We had been laying down our own notions as Gods great justice
Pauline drew away from her father so that she could look at him
And at last she saw into his heart
If I had only known she said and sat numb and stunned
When you were coming home from college her father went on your mother and I talked over what we should do
John had just confessed your secret marriage You knew that
Yes and we understood Polly
You were so youngso headstrongand you couldnt appreciate our reasons
Paulines brain was reeling
Your mother and I talked it over before you got home and thought it best to leave you entirely free to choose
But when we saw you overcome by joy Dont
she interrupted her voice a cry of pain
I cant bear it
Dont
Years of false selfsacrifice of deceiving her parents and her child of selfsuppression and selfdegradation and this final cruelty to Gladysall all in vain all a heaping of folly upon folly of wrong upon wrong
She rushed toward the house
She must fly somewhereanywhereto escape the thoughts that were picking with sharp beaks at her aching heart
Halfway up the walk she turned and fled to a refuge she would not have thought of half an hour before to her fathers arms
Oh father she cried
If I had only known you
Gladys returning from her walk went directly to Paulines sittingroom
Im off for New York and Europe tomorrow morning she began abruptly her voice hard her expression bitter and reckless
Where can she have heard about Leonora
thought Pauline
She said in a strained voice I had hoped you would stay here to look after the house
To look after the house
What do you mean
asked Gladys
But she was too full of herself to be interested in the answer and went on I want you to forget what I said to you
Ive got over all that
Ive come to my senses
Pauline began a nervous turning of her rings
Gladys gave a short grim laugh
I detest him she went on
Were very changeable we women arent we
I went out of this house two hours ago loving himto distraction
I came back hating him
And all that has happened in between is that I met him and he kissed me a few times and stabbed my pride a few times
Pauline stopped turning her ringsshe rose slowly mechanically looked straight at Gladys
That is not true she said calmly
Gladys laughed sardonically
You dont know the cold and haughty Governor Scarborough
Theres fire under the ice
I can feel the places on my face where it scorched
Cant you see them
Pauline gave her a look of disgust
How like John Dumonts sister
she thought
And she shut herself in her room and stayed there pleading illness in excuse until Gladys was gone
XXIII
A SEA SURPRISE
On the third day from New York Gladys was so far recovered from seasickness that she dragged herself to the deck
The water was fairly smooth but a sticky foggy rain was falling
A decksteward put her steamerchair in a sheltered corner
Her maid and a stewardess swathed her in capes and rugs she closed her eyes and said Now leave me please and dont come near me till I send for you
She slept an hour
When she awoke she felt better
Some one had drawn a chair beside hers and was seated therea man for she caught the faint odor of a pipe though the wind was the other way
She turned her head
It was Langdon whom she had not seen since she went below a few hours after Sandy Hook disappeared
Indeed she had almost forgotten that he was on board and that her brother had asked him to look after her
He was staring at her in an absentminded way his wonted expression of satire and lazy goodhumor fainter than usual
In fact his face was almost serious
That pipe she grumbled
Please do put it away
He tossed it into the sea
Beg pardon he said
It was stupid of me
I was absorbed inin my book
Whats the name of it
He turned it to glance at the cover but she went on Nodont tell me
Ive no desire to know
I asked merely to confirm my suspicion
Youre right he said
I wasnt reading
I was looking at you
That was impertinent
A man should not look at a woman when she doesnt intend him to look
Then Id never look at all
Im interested only in things not meant for my eyes
I might even read letters not addressed to me if I didnt know how dull letters are
No intelligent person ever says anything in a letter nowadays
They use the telegraph for ordinary correspondence and telepathy for the other kind
But it was interestinglooking at you as you lay asleep
Was my mouth open
A little
Am I yellow
Very
Eyes red
Hair in strings
Lips blue
All that he said and skin somewhat mottled
But I was not so much interested in your beauty as I was in trying to determine whether you were well enough to stand two shocks
I need them replied Gladys
One is rather unpleasant the otherthe reverse in fact a happiness
The unpleasant first please
Certainly he replied
Always the medicine first then the candy
And he leaned back and closed his eyes and seemed to be settling himself for indefinite silence
Go on she said impatiently
Whats the medicine
A death
I said unpleasant didnt I
When an enemy dies its all joy
When a friend passes over to eternal bliss why being good Christians we are not so faithless and selfish as to let the momentary separation distress us
But what is it
Youre trying to gain time by all this beating about the bush
You ought to know me well enough to know you can speak straight out
Fanshaws suing his wife for divorceand he names Jack
Is that your news
said Gladys languidly
Suddenly she flung aside the robes and sat up
Whats Pauline going to do
Can she Gladys paused
Yes she canif she wishes to
Butwill she
Will she
demanded Gladys
Jack doesnt know what shell do replied Langdon
Hes keeping quietthe only sane course when that kind of storm breaks
He had hoped youd be there to smooth her down but he says when he opened the subject of your going back to Saint X you cut him off
Does she know
Somebody must have told her the day you left
Dont you remember she was taken ill suddenly
Oh
Gladys vividly recalled Paulines strange look and manner
She could see her sisterinlawthe long lithe form the small graceful head with its thick soft waving hair the oval face the skin as fine as the petals at the heart of a rose the arched brows and goldenbrown eyes that look that air as of buoyant life locked in the spell of an icy trance mysterious fascinating sometimes so melancholy
I almost hope shell do it Mowbray she said
Jack doesnt deserve her
Hes not a bit her sort
She ought to have married Some one who had her sort of idealssome one like that big handsome chapthe one you admired so franticallyGovernor Scarborough
He was chock full of ideals
And hes making the sort of career she could sympathize with
Scarborough
exclaimed Gladys with some success at selfconcealment
I detest him
I detest careers
Good said Langdon his face serious his eyes amused
That opens the way for my other shock
Oh the good news
What is it
That Id like it if youd marry me
Gladys glanced into his still amused eyes then with a shrug sank back among her wraps
A poor joke she said
I should say that marriage was a stale joke rather than a poor one
Will you try itwith me
You might do worse
How did you have the courage to speak when Im looking such a wreck
she asked with mock gravity
But you aintyoure looking better now
That first shock braced you up
Besides this isnt romance
Its no high flight with all the longer drop and all the harder jolt at the landing
Its a plain practical proposition
Gladys slowly sat up and studied him curiously
Do you really mean it
she asked
Each was leaning on an elbow gazing gravely into the others face
Id never joke on such a dangerous subject as marriage
Im far too timid for that
What do you say Gladys
She had never seen him look serious before and she was thinking that the expression became him
He knows how to make himself attractive to a woman when he cares to she said to herself
Id like a man that has lightness of mind
Serious people bore one so after a while
By serious people she meant one serious person whom she had admired particularly for his seriousness
But she was in another mood now another atmospherethe atmosphere she had breathed since she was thirteen except in the brief period when her infatuation for Scarborough had swept her away from her world
No
She shook her head with decisionand felt decided
But to his practised ear there was in her voice a hint that she might hear him further on the subject
They lay back in their chairs he watching the ragged dirty scurrying clouds she watching him
After a while he said Where are you going when we reach the other side
To join mother and auntie
And how long will you stay with them
Not more than a week I should say she answered with a grimace
And thenwhere
She did not reply for some time
Studying her face he saw an expression of lonesomeness gather and strengthen and deepen until she looked so forlorn that he felt as if he must take her in his arms
When she spoke it was to say dubiously Back to New Yorkto keep house for my brotherperhaps
And when his wife frees herself and he marries againwhere will you go
Gladys lifted a fold of her cape and drew it about her as if she were cold
But he noted that it hid her face from him
You wantyou needa home
So do I he went on tranquilly
You are tired of wandering
So am I
You are bored with parade and paradepeople
So am I
You wish freedom not bondage when you marry
I refuse to be bound and I dont wish to bind any one
We have the same friends the same tastes have had pretty much the same experiences
You dont want to be married for your money
Im not likely to be suspected of doing that sort of thing
Some one has said that rich men marry more often for money than poor men interrupted Gladys
And then she colored as she recalled who had said it
Langdon noted her color as he noted every point in any game he was playing he shrewdly guessed its origin
When Scarborough told you that he replied calmly he told you a great truth
But please remember I merely said I shouldnt be SUSPECTED of marrying you for money
I didnt say I wasnt guilty
Is your list of reasons complete
Two more the clinchers
You are disappointed in loveso am I
You need consolationso do I
When one cant have the best one takes the best one can get if one is sensible
It has been known to turn out not so badly
They once more lay back watching the clouds
An hour passed without eithers speaking
The decksteward brought them tea and biscuits which he declined and she accepted
She tried the big hard tasteless disk between her strong white teeth then said with a sly smile You pried into my secret a few minutes ago
Im going to pry into yours
Who was she
As the lady would have none of me theres no harm in confessing replied Langdon carelessly
She wasand isand he looked at herever shall be world without endGladys Dumont
Gladys gasped and glanced at him with swift suspicion that he was jesting
He returned her glance in a calm matteroffact way
She leaned back in her chair and they watched the slippery rail slide up and down against the background of chilly rainy sea and sky
Are you asleep
he asked after a long silence
No she replied
I was thinking
Of myproposition
Yes
Doesnt it grow on you
Yes
He shifted himself to a sitting position with much deliberateness
He put his hand in among her rugs and wraps until it touched hers
It may turn out better than you anticipate he said a little sentiment in his eyes and smile a little raillery in his voice
I doubt if it will she answered without looking at him directly
ForIanticipate a great deal
XXIV
DUMONT BETRAYS DUMONT
Fanshaw versus Fanshaw was heard privately by a referee and before Mrs Fanshaws lawyers had a chance to ask that the referees report be sealed from publicity the judge of his own motion ordered it
At the political club to which he belonged he had received an intimation from the local boss that if Dumonts name were anywhere printed in connection with the case he would be held responsible
Thus it came to pass that on the morning of the filing of the decree the newspapers were grumbling over their inability to give the eagerlyawaited details of the great scandal
And Herron was Catonizing against judicial corruption
But Dumont was overswift in congratulating himself on his escape and in preening himself on his power
For several days the popular newspapers were alone in denouncing the judge for favoritism and in pointing out that the judiciary were becoming subservient to the rich and the powerful in their rearrangements of their domestic relationsa long first step toward complete subservience
Herron happened to have among his intimates the editor of an eminently respectable newspaper that prides itself upon never publishing private scandals
He impressed his friend with his own strong views as to the gravity of this growing discrimination between masses and classes and the organ of independent conservatism was presently lifting up its solemn voice in a stentorian jeremiad
Without this reinforcement the yellows might have shrieked in vain
It was assumed that baffled sensationalism was by far a stronger motive with them than justice and the public was amused rather than aroused by their protests
But now soberer dailies and weeklies took up the case and the discussion spread to other cities to the whole country
By his audacity by his arrogant frankness he had latterly treated public opinion with scantiest courtesyby his purchase of campaign committees and legislatures and courts Dumont had made himself in the public mind an embodiment of the mighty and menacing plutocracy of which the campaign orators talked so much
And the various phases of the scandal gave the press a multitude of texts for satirical or pessimistic or fiery discourses upon the public and private rottenness of plutocrats
But Dumonts name was never directly mentioned
Every one knew who was meant no newspaper dared to couple him in plain language with the scandal
The nearest approach to it was where one New York newspaper published without comment in the center of a long news article on the case two photographs of Dumont side by sideone taken when he first came to New York clearcut handsome courageous apparently a type of progressive young manhood the other taken within the year gross lowering tyrannical obviously a type of indulged selfindulgent despot
Herron had forced Fanshaw to abandon the idea of suing Dumont for a money consolation
He had been deeply impressed by his wifes warnings against Fanshawa lump of soot and sure to smutch you if you go near him
He was reluctant to have Fanshaw give up the part of the plan which insured the public damnation of Dumont but there was no other prudent course
He assured himself that he knew Fanshaw to be an upright man but he did not go to so perilous a length in selfdeception as to fancy he could convince cynical and incredulous New York
It was too eager to find excuses for successful and admired men like Dumont too ready to laugh at and despise underdogs like Fanshaw
Herron never admitted it to himself but in fact it was he who put it into Fanshaws resourceless mind to compass the revenge of publicity in another way
Fanshaw was denouncing the judge for sealing the divorce testimony and the newspapers for being so timid about libel laws and contempt of court
If a newspaper should publish the testimony said Herron Judge Glassford would never dare bring the editor before him for contempt
His records too bad
I happen to know he was in the NewsRecord office no longer ago than last month begging for the suppression of an article that might have caused his impeachment if published
So theres one paper that wouldnt be afraid of him
Then why does it shield the scoundrel
Perhaps replied Herron his hand on the door of his office lawlibrary it hasnt been able to get hold of a copy of the testimony
And having thus dropped the seed on good soil he left
Fanshaw waited several weeks waited until certain other plans of his and Herrons were perfected
Then he suddenly deluged the sinking flames of the divorce discussion with a huge outpouring of oil
Indirectly and with great secrecy he sent a complete copy of the testimony to the newspaper Herron had mentioned the most sensational and one of the most widely circulated in New York
The next morning Dumont had to ring three times for his secretary
When Culver finally appeared he had in his trembling right hand a copy of the NewsRecord
His face suggested that he was its owner publisher and responsible editor and that he expected then and there to be tortured to death for the two illustrated pages of the Great FanshawDumont Divorce
All the Testimony
Shocking Revelations
I thought it necessary for you to know this without delay sir he said in a shaky voice as he held out the newspaper to his master
Dumont grew sickly yellow with the first glance at those headlines
He had long been used to seeing extensive and highly unflattering accounts of himself and his doings in print but theretofore every open attack had been on some public matter where a newspaper pounding might be attributed to politics or stockjobbery
Hereit was a verbatim official report and of a private scandal more dangerous to his financial standing than the fiercest assault upon his honesty as a financier for it tore away the foundation of reputationprivate character
A faithful transcript throughout it portrayed him as a bag of slimy gold and gilded slime
He hated his own face staring out at him from a threecolumn cut in the center of the first pageits heavy jaw its cynical mouth its impudent eyes
Do I look like THAT
he thought
He was like one who walking along the streets catches sight of his own image in a showwindow mirror and before he recognizes it sees himself as others see him
He flushed to his temples at the contrast with the smaller cut beside itthe face of Pauline high and fine icily beautiful as always in her New York days when her features were in repose
Culver shifted from one weak leg to the other and the movement reminded Dumont of his existence
Thats all
Clear out
he exclaimed and fell back into his big chair and closed his eyes
He thought he at last understood publicity
But he was mistaken
He finished dressing and choked down a little breakfast
As he advanced toward the front door the servant there coughed uneasily and said Beg pardon sir but I fear you wont be able to get out
Whats the matter
he demanded his brows contracting and his lips beginning to slide back in a snarlit promised to be a sad morning for human curs of all kinds who did not scurry out of the lions way
The crowd sir said the servant
And he drew aside the curtain across the glass in one of the inside pair of great double doors of the palace entrance
Its quite safe to look sir
They cant see through the outside doors as far as this
Dumont peered through the bronze fretwork
A closely packed mass of people was choking the sidewalk and streethis brougham was like an island in a troubled lake
He saw several policementhey were trying to move the crowd on but not trying sincerely
He saw three huge cameras their operators under the black cloths their lenses pointed at the doorwaiting for him to appear
For the first time in his life he completely lost his nerve
Not only publicity the papera lifeless sheet of print but also publicity the publicwith living eyes to peer and living voices to jeer
He looked helplessly appealingly at the cur he had itched to kick the moment before
What the devil shall I do
he asked in a voice without a trace of courage
I dont know sir replied the servant
The basement door wouldnt help very much would it
The basement door was in front also
Idiot
Is there no way out at the rear
he asked
Only over the fences sir said the servant perfectly matteroffact
Having no imagination his mind made no picture of the great captain of industry scrambling over back fences like a stray cat flying from a brick
Dumont turned back and into his firstfloor sittingroom
He unlocked his stand of brandy bottles poured out an enormous drink and gulped it down
His stomach reeled then his head
He went to the window and looked outthere must have been five hundred people in the street and vehicles were making their way slowly and with difficulty drivers gaping at the house and joking with the crowd newsboys bent sidewise to balance their huge bundles of papers were darting in and out and even through the thick plate glass he could hear All about Millionaire Dumonts disgrace
He went through to a rear window
No there was a continuous wall a high brick wall
A servant came and told him he was wanted at the telephone
It was Giddings who said in a voice that was striving in vain to be calm against the pressure of some intense excitement You are coming down today Mr
Dumont
Why
asked Dumont snapping the word out as short and savage as the crack of a lash
There are disquieting rumors of a raid on us
Whos to do the raiding
They say its Patterson and FanningSmith and Cassell and Herron
Its a raid for control
Dumont snorted scornfully
Dont fret
Were all right
Ill be down soon
And he hung up the receiver muttering The ass
I must kick him out
Hes an old woman the instant I turn my back
He had intended not to go down but to shut himself in with the brandy bottle until nightfall
This news made his presence in the Street imperative
They couldnt have sprung at me at a worse time he muttered
But I can take care of em
He returned to the library took another drink larger than the first
His blood began to pound through his veins and to rush along under the surface of his skin like a sheet of fire
Waves of fury surged into his brain making him dizzy confusing his sighthe could scarcely refrain from grinding his teeth
He descended to the basement his step unsteady
A ladder he ordered in a thick voice
He led the way to the rear wall
A dozen menservants swarming about tried to assist him
He ordered them aside and began to climb
As the upper part of his body rose above the wallline he heard a triumphant shout many voices crying There he is
There he is
The lot round the corner from his place was not built upon and there in the side street was a rapidly swelling crowd the camerabearers hastily putting their instruments in position the black cloths fluttering like palls or pirate flags
With a roaring howl he released his hold upon the ladder and shook both fists his swollen face blazing between them
He tottered fell backward crashed upon the stone flooring of the area
His head struck with a crack that made the womenservants scream
The men lifted him and carried him into the house
He was not stunned he tried to stand
But he staggered back into the arms of his valet and his butler
Brandy
he gasped
He took a third drinkand became unconscious
When the doctor arrived he was raving in a high fever
For years he had drunk to excessbut theretofore only when HE chose never when his appetite chose never when his affairs needed a clear brain
Now appetite long lying in wait for him had found him helpless in the clutches of rage and fear and had stolen away his mind
The news was telephoned to the office at halfpast eleven oclock
It doesnt matter said Giddings
Hed only make things worse if he were to come now
Giddings was apparently right
From a tower of strength supporting alone yet with ease National Woolens and the vast structure based upon it Dumont had crumbled into an obstruction and a weakness
There is an abysmal difference between everybody knowing a thing privately and everybody knowing precisely the same thing publicly
In that newspaper exposure there was no fact of importance that was not known to the entire Street to his chief supporters in his great syndicate of ranches railroads factories steamship lines and selling agencies
But the tremendous blare of publicity acted like Joshuas horns at Jericho
The solid walls of his public reputation tottered toppled fell flat
There had been a tight moneymarket for two weeks
Though there had been uneasiness as to all the small and many of the large industrials belief in National Woolens and in the stability of John Dumont had remained strong
But of all the cowards that stand sentinel for capital the most craven is Confidence
At the deafening crash of the fall of Dumonts private character Confidence girded its loins and tightened its vocal cords to be in readiness for a shrieking flight
Dumont ruled through a parent and central corporation the National Woolens Company which held a majority of the stock in each of the seventeen corporations constituting the trust
His control was in part through ownership of Woolens stock but chiefly through proxies sent him by thousands of small stockholders because they had confidence in his abilities
To wrest control from him it was necessary for the raiders both to make him unload his own holdings of stock and to impair his reputation so that his supporters would desert him or stand aloof
On the previous day National Woolens closed at eightytwo for the preferred and thirtynine for the common
In the first hour of the day of the raid Giddings and the other members of Dumonts supporting group of financiers were able to keep it fairly steady at about five points below the closing price of the previous day by buying all that was offeredthe early offerings were large but not overwhelming
The supporters of other industrials saw that the assault on Woolens was a menace to their stocksif a strong industrial weakened the weaker ones would inevitably suffer disaster in the frightened market that would surely result
They showed a disposition to rally to the support of the Dumont stocks
At eleven oclock Giddings began to hope that the raid was a failure if indeed it had been a real raid
At eleventwenty Herron played his trump card
The National Industrial Bank is the huge barometer to which both speculative and investing Wall Street looks for guidance
Whom that bank protects is as safe as was the medieval fugitive who laid hold of the altar in the sanctuary whom that bank frowns upon in the hour of stress is lost indeed if he have so much as a pinspoint area of heel that is vulnerable
Melville president of the National Industrial was a fanatically religious man with as keen a nose for heretics as for rotten spots in collateral
He was peculiarly savage in his hatred of all matrimonial deviations
He was a brother of Fanshaws mother and she and Herron had been working upon him
But so long as Dumonts share in the scandal was not publicly attributed he remained obduratehe never permitted his uptown creed or code to interfere with his downtown doings unless it became necessarythat is unless it could be done without money loss
For uptown or downtown to make money was always and in all circumstances the highest morality to lose money the profoundest immorality
At twenty minutes past eleven Melville and the president of the other banks of his chain called loans to Dumont and the Dumont supporting group to the amount of three millions and a quarter
Ten minutes later other banks and trust companies whose loans to Dumont and his allies either were on call or contained provisions permitting a demand for increased collateral followed Melvilles example and aimed and sped their knives for Dumonts vitals
Giddings found himself face to face with unexpected and peremptory demands for eleven millions in cash and thirteen millions in additional collateral securities
If he did not meet these demands forthwith the banks and trust companies to protect themselves would throw upon the market at whatever price they could get the thirtyodd millions of Woolens stocks which they held as collateral for the loans
What does this mean Eaversole
he exclaimed with white wrinkled lips heavy circles suddenly appearing under his eyes
Is Melville trying to ruin everything
No answered Eaversole third vicepresident of the company
Hes supporting the market all except us
He says Dumont must be driven out of the Street
He says his presence here is a pollution and a source of constant danger
The National Woolens supporting group was alone it could get no help from any quarter as every possible ally was frightened into his own breastworks for the defense of his own interests
Dumont the brain and the will of the group had made no false moves in business had been bold only where his matchless judgment showed him a clear way but he had not foreseen the instantaneous annihilation of his chief assethis reputation
Giddings sustained the unequal battle superbly
He was cool and watchful and effective
It is doubtful if Dumont himself could have done so well handicapped as he would have been on that day by the Fanshaw scandal
Giddings cajoled and threatened retreated slowly here advanced intrepidly there
On the one side he held back wavering banks and trust companies persuading some that all was well warning others that if they pressed him they would lose all
On the other side he faced his powerful foes and made them quake as they saw their battalions of millions roll upon his unbroken line of battle only to break and disappear
At noon National Woolens preferred was at fiftyeight the common at twentynine
Giddings was beginning to hope
At three minutes past noon the tickers clicked out It is reported that John Dumont is dying
As that last word jerked letter by letter from under the printing wheel the floor of the Stock Exchange became the rapids of a human Niagara
By messenger by telegraph by telephone holders of National Woolens and other industrials in the financial district in all parts of the country across the sea poured in their selling orders upon the frenzied brokers
And all these forces of hysteria and panic projected into that narrow roofedin space made of it a chaos of contending demons
All stocks were caught in the upheaval Melvilles plans to limit the explosion were blown skyward feeble as straws in a cyclone
Amid shrieks and howls and frantic tossings of arms and mad rushes and maniac contortions of faces National Woolens and all the Dumont stocks bent broke went smashing down down down every one struggling to unload
Dumonts fortune was the stateliest of the many galleons that day driven on the rocks and wrecked
Dumonts crew was for the most part engulfed
Giddings and a few selected friends reached the shore halfdrowned and humbly applied at the wreckers camp they were hospitably received and were made as comfortable as their exhausted condition permitted
John Dumont was at the mercy of Hubert Herron in his own company
If he lived he would be president only until the next annual meetingless than two months away and the Herron crowd had won over enough of his board of directors to make him meanwhile powerless where he had been autocrat
XXV
THE FALLEN KING
Toward noon the next day Dumont emerged from the stupor into which Doctor Sacketts opiate had plunged him
At once his mind began to grope about for the broken clues of his business
His valet appeared
The morning papers said Dumont
Yes sir replied the valet and disappeared
After a few seconds Culver came and halted just within the doorway
Im sorry sir but Doctor Sackett left strict orders that you were to be quiet
Your life depends on it
Dumont scowled and his lower lip projectedthe crowning touch in his most imperious expression
The papers all of emquick
he commanded
Culver took a last look at the bluewhite face and bloodshot eyes to give him courage to stand firm
The doctorll be here in a few minutes he said bowed and went out
Choking with impotent rage Dumont rang for his valet and forced him to help him dress
He was so weak when he finished that only his will kept him from fainting
He took a stiff drink of the brandythe odor was sickening to him and he could hardly force it down
But once down it strengthened him
No nothing to eat he said thickly and with slow but fairly steady step left his room and descended to the library
Culver was theresat agape at sight of his master
But youyou must not he began
Dumont gave him an ugly grin
But I will
he said and again drank brandy
He turned and went out and toward the front door Culver following with stammering protests which he heeded not at all
On the sidewalk he hailed a passing hansom
To the Edison Building he said and drove off Culver bareheaded at the curb looking dazedly after him
Before he reached Fiftyninth Street he was halfsitting halfreclining in the corner of the seat his eyes closed and his senses sinking into a stupor from the fumes of the powerful doses of brandy
As the hansom drove down the avenue many recognized him wondered and pitied as they noted his color his collapsed body head fallen on one side mouth open and lips greenish gray
As the hansom slowly crossed the tracks at Twentythird Street the heavy jolt roused him
The newspapers he muttered and hurled up through the trap in the roof an order to the driver to stop
He leaned over the doors and bought half a dozen newspapers of the woman at the Flatiron stand
As the hansom moved on he glanced at the headlinesthey were big and staring but his blurred eyes could not read them
He fell asleep again his hands clasped loosely about the huge proclamations of yesterdays battle and his rout
The hansom was caught in a jam at Chambers Street
The clamor of shouting swearing drivers roused him
The breeze from the open sea blowing straight up Broadway into his face braced him like the tonic that it is
He straightened himself recovered his train of thought stared at one of the newspapers and tried to grasp the meaning of its headlines
But they made only a vague impression on him
Its all lies he muttered
Lies
How could those fellows smash ME
And he flung the newspapers out of the hansom into the faces of two boys seated upon the tail of a truck
Youre drunk early yelled one of the boys
Thats no oneday jag shouted the other
Its a hangover
He made a wild threatening gesture and as his hansom drove on muttered and mumbled to himself vague profanity aimed at nothing and at everything
At the Edison Building he got out
Wait
he said to the driver
He did not see the impudent smirk on the face of the elevator boy nor the hesitating sheepish salutation of the doorman uncertain how to greet the fallen king
He went straight to his office unlocked his desk and just in time to save himself from fainting seized and halfemptied a flask of brandy he kept in a drawer
It had been therebut untouched ever since he came to New York and took those offices he never drank in business hours
His head was aching horribly and at every throb of his pulse a pain tore through him
He rang for his messenger
Tell Mr Giddings I want to see himyou
he said his teeth clenched and his eyes blazinghe looked insane
Giddings came
His conscience was clearhe had never liked Dumont owed him nothing yet had stood by him until further fidelity would have ruined himself would not have saved Dumont or prevented the HerronCassell raiders from getting control
Now that he could afford to look at his revengebooks he was deeply resenting the insults and indignities heaped upon him in the past five years
But he was unable to gloat was moved to pity at sight of the physical and mental wreck in that chair which he had always seen occupied by the most robust of despots
Well said Dumont in a dull faraway voice without looking at him
Whats happened
Giddings cast about for a smooth beginning but could find none
They did us upthats all he said funereally
Dumont lifted himself into a momentary semblance of his old look and manner
You lie damn you
he shouted his mouth raw and ragged as a hungry tigers
Giddings began to cringe remembered the changed conditions bounded to his feet
Ill tolerate such language from no man
he exclaimed
I wish you good morning sir
And he was on his way to the door
Come back
commanded Dumont
And Giddings the habit of implicit obedience to that voice still strong upon him hesitated and half turned
Dumont was more impressed with the truth of the cataclysm by Giddings revolt than by the newspaper headlines or by Giddings words
And from somewhere in the depths of his reserveself he summoned the last of his coolness and selfcontrol
Beg pardon Giddings said he
You see Im not well
Giddings returnedhe had taken orders all his life he had submitted to this master slavishly the concession of an apology mollified him and flattered him in spite of himself
Oh dont mention it he said seating himself again
As I was saying the raid was a success
I did the best I could
Some called our loans and some demanded more collateral
And while I was fighting front and rear and both sides bang came that lie about your condition
The market broke
All I could do was sell sell sell to try to meet or protect our loans
Giddings heard a sound that made him glance at Dumont
His head had fallen forward and he was snoring
Giddings looked long and pityingly
A sure enough dead one he muttered unconsciously using the slang of the Street which he habitually avoided
And he went away closing the door behind him
After half an hour Dumont roused himselfout of a stupor into a halfdelirious dream
Must get cash he mumbled and look after the time loans
He lifted his head and pushed back his hair from his hot forehead
Ill stamp on those curs yet
He took another drinkhis hands were so unsteady that he had to use both of them in lifting it to his lips
He put the flask in his pocket instead of returning it to the drawer
No one spoke to him all pretended not to see him as he passed through the offices on his way to the elevator
With glassy unseeing eyes he fumbled at the dashboard and side of the hansom with a groan like a rheumatic old mans he lifted his heavy body up into the seat dropped back and fell asleep
A crowd of clerks and messengers newsboys and peddlers gathered and gaped awed as they looked at the man who had been for five years one of the heroes of the Street and thought of his dazzling catastrophe
Whats the matter
inquired a newcomer apparently a tourist edging his way into the outskirts of the crowd
Thats Dumont the head of the Woolens Trust the curbbroker he addressed replied in a low tone
He was raided yesterdaywoke up in the morning worth a hundred millions went to bed worthperhaps five maybe nothing at all
At this exaggeration of the height and depth of the disaster awe and sympathy became intense in that cluster of faces
A hundred millions to nothing at all or at most a beggarly five millionswhat a dizzy precipice
Great indeed must be he who could fall so far
The driver peered through the trap wondering why his distinguished fare endured this vulgar scrutiny
He saw that Dumont was asleep thrust down a hand and shook him
Where to sir
he asked as Dumont straightened himself
To the National Industrial Bank you fool snapped Dumont
How many times must I tell you
Thank you sir said the driverwithout sarcasm thinking steadfastly of his payand drove swiftly away
Theretofore whenever he had gone to the National Industrial Bank he had been received as one king is received by another
Either eager and obsequious high officers of King Melville had escorted him directly to the presence or King Melville because he had a caller who could not be summarily dismissed had come out apologetically to conduct King Dumont to another audience chamber
That day the third assistant cashier greeted him with politeness carefully graded to the due of a man merely moderately rich and not a factor in the game of high finance
Be seated Mr Dumont he said pointing to a chair just inside the railinga seat not unworthy of a man of rank in the plutocratic hierarchy but a man of far from high rank
Ill see whether Mr Melvilles disengaged
Dumont dropped into the chair and his heavy head was almost immediately resting upon his shirtbosom
The third assistant cashier returned roused him somewhat impatiently
Mr Melvilles engaged said he
But Mr Cowles will see you
Mr Cowles was the third vicepresident
Dumont rose
The blood flushed into his face and his body shook from head to foot
Tell Melville to go to hell he jerked out the haze clearing for a moment from his piercing wicked eyes
And he stalked through the gateway in the railing
He turned
Tell him Ill tear him down and grind him into the gutter within six months
In the hansom again he reflected or tried to reflect
But the lofty buildings seemed to cast a black shadow on his mind and the roar and rush of the tremendous tide of traffic through that deep canon set his thoughts to whirling like drinkmaddened bacchanals dancing round a punchbowl
That woman
he exclaimed suddenly
What asses they make of us men
And all these vulturesIm not carrion yet
But THEY soon will be
And he laughed and his thoughts began their crazy spin again
A newsboy came waving an extra in at the open doors of the hansom
Dumonts downfall
he yelled in his shrill childish voice
All about the big smash
Dumont snatched a paper and flung a copper at the boy
Gimme a tip on Woolens Mr Dumont said the boy with an impudent grin balancing himself for flight
Hows Mrs
Fanshaw
The newspapers had made his face as familiar as the details of his private life
He shrank and quivered
He pushed up the trap
Home
he said forgetting that the hansom and driver were not his own
All right Mr
Dumont
replied the driver
Dumont shrank again and sat cowering in the cornerthe very calling him by his name now a synonym for failure disgrace ridicule and contempt seemed a subtile insult
With roaring brain and twitching dizzy eyes he read at the newspapers account of his overthrow
And gradually there formed in his mind a coherent notion of how it had come to pass of its extent of why he found himself lying in the depths the victim of humiliations so frightful that they penetrated even to him stupefied and crazed with drink and fever though he was
His courage his selfcommand were burnt up by the brandy
His body had at last revolted was having its terrible revenge upon the mind that had so long misused it in every kind of indulgence
Im done fordone for he repeated audibly again and again at each repetition looking round mentally for a fact or a hope that would deny this assertionbut he cast about in vain
Yes Im done for
And flinging away the newspaper he settled back and ceased to try to think of his affairs
After a while tears rolled from under his blue eyelids dropped haltingly down his cheeks spread out upon his lips tasted salt in his halfopen mouth
The hansom stopped before his brick and marble palace
The butler hurried out and helped him alightnot yet thirtyseven he felt as if he were a dying old man
Pay the cabby he said and groped his way into the house and to the elevator and mechanically ran himself up to his floor
His valet was in his dressingroom
He waved him away
Get out
And dont disturb me till I ring
The doctor began Mallow
Do as I tell you
When he was alone he poured out brandy and gulped it down a drink that might have eaten the lining straight out of a stomach less powerful than his
He went from door to door locking them all
Then he seated himself in a loungingchair before the long mirror
He stared toward the image of himself but was so dimeyed that he could see nothing but spinning black disks
Lifes not such a good game even when a mans winning he said aloud
A rotten bad game when hes losing
His head wabbled to fall forward but he roused himself
Wife gone The tears flooded his eyestears of pity for himself an injured and abandoned husband
Wife gone he repeated
Friends gone He laughed sardonically
No never had friends thank God or I shouldnt have lasted this long
No such thing as friendsa man gets what he can pay for
Grip goneluck gone
Whats the use
He dozed off presently to start into acute shuddering consciousness
At the far end of the room stirring slowly oozing from under the divan was aa Thing
He could not define its shape but he knew that it was vast that it was scaly with many short fat legs tipped with claws that its color was green that its purpose was hideous gleaming in craft from large square greenyellow eyes
He wiped the sticky sweat from his brow
Its only the brandy he said loudly and the Thing faded vanished
He drew a deep breath of relief
He went to a case of drawers and stood before it supporting himself by the handles of the second drawer
Yes he reflected the revolvers in that drawer
He released the handles and staggered back to his chair
Im crazy he muttered crazy as a loon
I ought to ring for the doctor
In a moment he was up again but instead of going toward the bell he went to the drawers and opened the second one
In a compartment lay a pearlhandled selfcocking revolver
He put his hand on it shivered drew his hand awaythe steel and the pearl were cold
He closed the drawer with a quick push opened it again slowly took up the revolver staggered over to his desk and laid it there
His face was chalkwhite in spots and his eyes were stiff in their sockets
He rested his aching burning reeling head on his hands and stared at the revolver
But he said aloud as if contemptuously dismissing a suggestion why should I shoot myself
I can smash em allto powdergrind em into the dirt
He took up the revolver
Whatd be the use of smashing em
he said wearily
He felt tired and sick horribly sick
He laid it down
Id better be careful he thought
Im not in my right mind
I might He took it in his hand and went to the mirror and put the muzzle against his temple
He laughed crazily
A little pressure on that trigger andbang
Id be in kingdom come and shouldnt give a damn for anybody
He caught sight of his eyes in the mirror and hastily dropped his arm to his side
No Id never shoot myself in the temple
The heartd be better
Just hereand he pressed the muzzle into the soft material of his coatif I touched the trigger And his finger did touch the trigger
Pains shot through his chest like cracks radiating in glass when a stone strikes it
He looked at his facewhite with wild eyes with lips blue and ajar the sweat streaming from his forehead
What have I done
he shrieked mad with the dread of death
I must call for help
He turned toward the door plunged forward fell unconscious the revolver flung halfway across the room
When he came to his senses he was in his bedcomfortable weak lazy
With a slight effort he caught the thread of events
He turned his eyes and saw a nurse seated at the head of his bed reading
Am I going to die
he askedhis voice was thin and came in faint gusts
Certainly not replied the nurse putting down her book and standing over him her face showing genuine reassurance and cheerfulness
Youll be well very soon
But you must lie quiet and not talk
Was it a bad wound
The fever was the worst
The bullet glanced round just under the surface
It was an accident he said after a moments thought
I suppose everybody is saying I tried to kill myself
Everybody doesnt know anything about it
Almost nobody knows
Even the servants dont know
Your secretary sent them away broke in and found you
He closed his eyes and slept
When he awoke again he felt that a long time had passed that he was much better that he was hungry
Nurse
he called
The woman at the head of the bed rose and laid a cool hand upon his forehead
How good that feels he mumbled gratefully
What nice hands you have nurse and he lifted his glance to her face
He stared wonderingly confusedly
I thought I was awake and almost well he murmured
And instead Im out of my head
Can I do anything for you
It certainly was HER voice
Is it you Pauline
he asked as if he feared a negative answer
YesJohn
A long silence then he said Why did you come
The doctor wrote me thatwrote me the truth
But havent you heard
Havent you seen the papers
Dont they say Im ruined
Yes John
He lay silent for several minutes
Then he asked hesitatingly Andwhendo yougo backWest
I have come to stay she replied
Neither in her voice nor in her face was there a hint of what those five words meant to her
He closed his eyes again
Presently a tear slid from under each lid and stood in the deep wasted hollows of his eyesockets
XXVI
A DESPERATE RALLY
When he awoke again he felt that he should get well rapidly
He was weak but it seemed the weakness of hunger rather than of illness
His head was clear his nerves tranquil his mind was as hungry for action as his body was for food
As soon as Ive had something to eat he said to himself Ill be better than for years
I needed this
And straightway he began to take hold of the outside world
Are you there Pauline
he asked after perhaps half an hour during which his mind had swiftly swept the whole surface of his affairs
The nurse rose from the lounge across the foot of the bed
Your wife was worn out Mr Dumont she began
She has What day is it
he interrupted
Thursday
Of the month I mean
The seventeenth she answered smiling in anticipation of his astonishment
But he said without change of expression Then Ive been ill three weeks and three days
Tell Mr Culver I wish to see him at once
But the doctor Damn the doctor replied Dumont goodnaturedly
Dont irritate me by opposing
I shant talk with Culver a minute by the clock
What I say will put my mind at rest
Then Ill eat something and sleep for a day at least
The nurse hesitated but his eyes fairly forced her out of the room to fetch Culver
Now remember Mr Dumontless than a minute she said
Ill come back in just sixty seconds
Come in forty he replied
When she had closed the door he said to Culver What are the quotations on Woolens
Preferred twentyeight Common seven answered Culver
Theyve been about steady for two weeks
Good
And whats Great Lakes and Gulf
Culver showed his surprise
Ill have to consult the paper he said
You never asked me for that quotation before
Id no idea youd want it
He went to the next room and immediately returned
G L and G one hundred and two
Dumont smiled with a satisfied expression
Nowgo downtownwhat time is it
Eight oclock
Morning
Yes sir morning
Go downtown at once and set expert accountantsget Evarts and Schumanset them at work on my personal accounts with the Woolens Company
Tell everybody Im expected to die and know it and am getting facts for making my will
And stay downtown yourself all dayfind out everything you can about National Woolens and that raiding crowd and about Great Lakes and Gulf
The better you succeed in this mission the better itll be for you
Thank you by the way for keeping my accident quiet
Find out how the FanningSmiths are carrying National Woolens
Find out The door opened and the plain clean figure of the nurse appeared
The minutes up she said
One second more please
Close the door
When she had obeyed he went on See Tavistockyou know you must be careful not to let any one at his office know that youre connected with me
See himask himno telephone Tavistock to come at onceand you find out all you can independentlyespecially about the FanningSmiths and Great Lakes and Gulf
Very well said Culver
A great deal depends on your success continued Dumonta great deal for me a great deala VERY great deal for you
His look met Culvers and each seemed satisfied with what he saw
Then Culver went saying to himself What makes him think the FanningSmiths were mixed up in the raid
And what on earth has G L and G got to do with it
Gad hes a WONDER
The longer Culver lived in intimacy with Dumont the greater became to him the mystery of his combination of bigness and littleness audacity and caution devil and man
It gets me he often reflected how a man can plot to rob millions of people in one hour and in the next plan endowments for hospitals and colleges despise public opinion one minute and the next be courting it like an actor
But thats the way with all these big fellows
And Ill know how to do it when I get to be one of em
As the nurse reentered Dumonts bedroom he called out lively as a boy SOMETHING to eat
ANYthing to eat
EVERYthing to eat
The nurse at first flatly refused to admit Tavistock
But at halfpast nine he entered tall lean lithe sharp of face shrewd of eye rakish of mustache by Dumonts direction he closed and locked the door
Why
he exclaimed you dont look much of a sick man
Youre thin but your colors not bad and your eyes are clear
And downtown they have you dying
Dumont laughed
Tavistock instantly recognized in laugh and look Dumonts battle expression
Dyingyes
Dying to get at em
Tavistock well kick those fellows out of Wall Street before the middle of next week
How much Great Lakes is there floating on the market
Tavistock looked puzzled
He had expected to talk National Woolens and this man did not even speak of it seemed absorbed in a stock in which Tavistock did not know he had any interest whatever
G L and G
he said
Not muchperhaps thirty thousand shares
Its been quiet for a long time
Its an investment stock you know
Dumont smiled peculiarly
I want a list of the stockholdersnot all only those holding more than a thousand shares
There arent many big holders
Most of the stocks in small lots in the middle West
So much the better
Im pretty sure I can get you a fairly accurate list
Tavistock Dumonts very private and personal broker had many curious ways of reaching into the carefully guarded books and other business secrets of brokers and of the enterprises listed on the New York Stock Exchange
He and Dumont had long worked together in the speculative parts of Dumonts schemes
Dumont was the chief source of his rapidly growing fortune though no one except Culver not even Mrs Tavistock knew that they had business relations
Dumont moved through Tavistock secretly and Tavistock in turn moved through other agents secretly
But for such precautions as these the great men of Wall Street would be playing with all the cards exposed for the very lambs to cock their ears at
I want it immediately said Dumont
Only the larger holders you understand
Haste always costs
Ill have to get hold of a man who can get hold of some one high up in the Great Lakes dividend department
Pay what you musttentwenty thousandmore if necessary
But get it tonight
Ill try
Then youll get it
He slept with a break of fifteen minutes until ten the next morning
Then Tavistock appeared with the list
It was nearly midnight before my man could strike a bargain so I didnt telephone you
The dividend clerk made a memory list
I had him verify it this morning as early as he could get at the books
He says at least a third of the road is held in small lots abroad
Hes been in charge of the books for twenty years and he says there have been more changes in the last two months than in all that time
He thinks somebody has sold a big block of the stock on the quiet
Dumont smiled significantly
I think I understand that he said
He glanced at the list
Its even shorter than I thought
You notice onethird of the stocks tied up in the Wentworth estate said Tavistock
Yes
And heres the name of Bowens dividend clerk
Bowen is traveling in the far East
Probably hes left no orders about his Great Lakeswhy should he when its supposed to be as sound and steady as Government bonds
That means another fifty thousand shares out of the way for our purposes
Which of these names stand for the FanningSmiths
I only recognize ScannellJames FanningSmiths private secretary
But there must be others as hes down for only twentyone thousand shares
Then hes the only one said Dumont for the FanningSmiths have only twentyone thousand shares at the present time
I know that positively
What
Tavistock showed that he was astounded
I knew James FanningSmith was an ass but I never suspected him of such folly as that
So they are the ones that have been selling
Yesnot only selling what they owned but also However no matter
Its safe to say there are less than a hundred and fifty thousand shares for us to take care of
I want you to get meright awayoptions for fifteen days on as many of these remaining big lots as possible
Make the best terms you cananything up to one hundred and twentyfiveand offer five or even ten dollars a share forfeit for the option
Make bigger offersfifteenwhere its necessary
Set your people to work at once
Theyve got the rest of today all day tomorrow all day Sunday
But Id rather the whole thing were closed up by Saturday night
Ill be satisfied when youve got me control of a hundred thousand sharesthatll be the outside of safety
Yes youre reasonably sure to win if you can carry that and look after offerings of fifty thousand in the market
The options on the hundred thousand shares oughtnt to cost you much more than a million
The fifty thousand youll have to buy in the market may cost you six or seven millions
Tavistock recited these figures carelessly
In reality he was watching Dumont shrewdly for he had believed that the National Woolens raid had ruined him had certainly put him out of the large Wall Street moves
In that small drawer to the left in the desk there said Dumont pointing
Bring me the InterState National checkbook and pen and ink
When he had the book he wrote eight checks the first for fifty thousand the next five for one hundred thousand each the last two for two hundred and fifty thousand each
The first check he said you may use whenever you like
The others except the last two will be good after two oclock today
The last two can be used any time after eleven tomorrow
Anddont forget
Im supposed to be hopelessly illbut then no one must know youve seen me or know anything about me
Spread it as a rumor
Tavistock went away convinced enthusiastic
There was that in Dumont which inspired men to their strongest most intelligent efforts
He was harsh he was tyrannical treacherous evenin a large way often cynically ungrateful
But he knew how to lead knew how to make men forget all but the passion for victory and follow him loyally
Tavistock had seen his financial brain solve too many unsolvable problems not to have confidence in it
I might have known
he reflected
Why those fellows apparently only scotched him
They got the Woolens Company away from him
He lets it go without a murmur when he sees hes beaten and he turns his mind to grabbing a big railway as if Woolens had never existed
Just after his elevated train passed Chatham Square on the way downtown Tavistock suddenly slapped his leg with noisy energy and exclaimed halfaloud By Jove of course
to the amusement of those near him in the car
He went on to himself Why didnt I see it before
Because its so beautifully simple like all the things the big uns do
Hes a wonder
So THATS what hes up to
Gad what a breeze therell be next week
At eleven oclock Doctor Sackett came into Dumonts bedroom in arms against his patient
Youre acting like a lunatic
No business I saynot for a week
Absolute quiet Mr Dumont or Ill not answer for the consequences
I see you want to drive me back into the fever replied Dumont
But Im bent on getting well
I need the medicine Ive had this morning and Culvers bringing me another dose
If Im not better when he leaves I agree to try your prescription of fret and fume
You are risking your life
Dumont smiled
Possibly
But Im risking it for whats more than life to me my dear Sackett
Youll excite yourself
Youll On the contrary I shall calm myself
Im never so calm and cheerful as when Im fighting unless its when Im getting ready to fight
Theres something inside meI dont know whatbut it wont let me rest till it has pushed me into action
Thats my nature
If any one asks how I am say youve no hope of my recovery
I shall tell only the truth in that case said Sackett but with resignationhe was beginning to believe that for his extraordinary patient extraordinary remedies might be best
Dumont listened to Culvers report without interrupting him once
Culvers position had theretofore been most disadvantageous to himself
He had been too near to Dumont had been merged in Dumonts big personality
Whatever he did well seemed to Dumont merely the direct reflection of his own abilities whatever he did ill seemed far more stupid than a similar blunder made by a less intimate subordinatewhat excuse for Culvers going wrong with the guiding hand of the Great Man always upon him
In this his first important independent assignment he had at last an opportunity to show his master what he could do to show that he had not learned the Dumont methods parrotfashion but intelligently that he was no mere reflecting asteroid to the Dumont sun but a selfluminous if lesser and dependent star
Dumont was in a peculiarly appreciative mood
Why the fellows got brainsGOOD brains was his inward comment again and again as Culver unfolded the information he had collectedclear accurate nonessentials discarded essentials given in detail hidden points brought to the surface
It was proof positive of Dumonts profound indifference to money that he listened without any emotion either of anger or of regret to the first part of Culvers tale the survey of the wreckwhat had been forty millions now reduced to a dubious six
Dumont had neither time nor strength for emotion he was using all his mentality in gaging what he had for the work in handjust how long and how efficient was the broken sword with which he must face his enemies in a struggle that meant utter ruin to him if he failed
For he felt that if he should fail he would never again be able to gather himself together to renew the combat either he would die outright or he would abandon himself to the appetite which had just shown itself dangerously near to being the strongest of the several passions ruling him
When Culver passed to the Herron coterie and the FanningSmiths and Great Lakes and Gulf Dumont was still motionlesshe was now estimating the strength and the weaknesses of the enemy and miscalculation would be fatal
At the end of threequarters of an hour Culver stopped the steady swift flow of his reportThats all the important facts
Theres a lot more but it would be largely repetition
Dumont looked at him with an expression that made him proud
Thanks Culver
At the next annual meeting well elect you to Giddings place
Please go back downtown and He rapidly indicated half a dozen points which Culver had failed to see and investigatethe best subordinate has not the masters eye if he had he would not be a subordinate
Dumont waved his hand in dismissal and settled himself to sleep
When Culver began to stammer thanks for the promised promotion he frowned
Dont bother me with that sort of stuff
The jobs yours because youve earned it
Itll be yours as long as you can hold it downor until you earn a better one
And youll be loyal as Giddings wasjust as long as its to your interest and not a second longer
Otherwise youd be a fool and Id not have you about me
Be off
He slept an hour and a half then Pauline brought him a cup of beef extractA very small cup he grumbled goodhumoredly
And a very weak watery mess in it
As he lay propped in his bed drinking itslowly to make it last the longerPauline sat looking at him
His hands had been fat and puffy she was filled with pity as she watched the almost scrawny hand holding the cup to his lips there were hollows between the tendons and the wrist was gaunt
Her gaze wandered to his face and rested there in sympathy and tenderness
The ravages of the fever had been frightfulhollows where the swollen sensual cheeks had been the neck caved in behind and under the jawbones loose skin hanging in wattles deeplyset eyes a pinched look about the nostrils and the corners of the mouth
He was homely ugly even except the noble curve of head and profile not a trace of his former good looksbut at least that swinish fleshy fleshly expression was gone
A physical wreck battered torn dismantled by the storm and fire of disease
It was hard for her to keep back her tears
Their eyes met and his instantly shifted
The rest of the world saw the man of force bent upon the possessions which mean fame and honor regardless of how they are got
He knew that he could deceive the world that so long as he was rich and powerful it would refuse to let him undeceive it though he might strive to show it what he was
But he knew that SHE saw him as he really wasknew him as only a husband and a wife can know each the other
And he respected her for the qualities which gave her a right to despise him and which had forced her to exercise that right
He felt himself the superior of the rest of his fellowbeings but her inferior did she not successfully defy him could she not without a word by simply resting her calm gaze upon him make him shift and slink
He felt that he must change the subjectnot of their conversation for they were not talking but of theirherthoughts
He did not know precisely what she was thinking of him but he was certain that it was not anything favorable how could it be
In fact fight though she did against the thought into her mind as she looked pitying yet shrinking came his likeness to a wolfstarved and sick and gaunt by weakness tamed into surface restraint but in vicious teeth in savage lips in jaw made to crush for love of crushing a wicked wolf impatient to resume the life of the beast of prey
By a mischance unavoidable in a mind filled as was his he began to tell of his revengeof the exhibition of power he purposed to give sudden and terrible
He talked of his enemies as a cat might of a mouse it was teasing in the impassable circle of its paws
She felt that they deserved the thunderbolt he said he was about to hurl into them but she could not help feeling pity for them
If what he said of his resources and power were true how feeble how helpless they werepygmies fatuously disporting themselves in the palm of a giants hand unconscious of where they were of the cruel eyes laughing at them of the iron muscles that would presently contract that hand andshe shuddered his voice came to her in a confused murmur
If he does not stop I shall loathe him AGAIN
she said to herself
Then to him Perhaps youd like to see Langdonhes in the drawingroom with Gladys
I sent for him two hours ago
Yes tell him to come up at once
As she took the cup he detained her hand
She beat down the impulse to snatch it away let it lie passive
He pressed his lips upon it
I havent thanked you for coming back he said in a low voice holding to her hand nervously
But you know it wasnt because Im not grateful dont you
I can hardly believe yet that it isnt a dream
Id have said there wasnt a human being on earth whod have done itexcept your mother
No not even you only your mother
At this tribute to her mother unexpected sincere tears dimmed Paulines eyes and a sob choked up into her throat
It was your mother in you that made you come he went on
But you cameand Ill not forget it
You said you had come to stayis that so Pauline
She bent her head in assent
When Im well and on top againbut theres nothing in words
All Ill say is youre giving me a chance and Ill make the best of it
Ive learned my lesson
He slowly released her hand
She stood there a moment without speaking without any definite thought
Then she left to send Langdon
Yes Dumont reflected it was her duty
Its a womans duty to be forgiving and gentle and loving and puretheyre made differently from men
It was unnatural her ever going away at all
But shes a good woman and she shall get what she deserves hereafter
When I settle this bill for my foolishness Ill not start another
Dutythat word summed up his whole conception of the right attitude of a good woman toward a man
A woman who acted from love might change her mind but duty was safe was always there when a man came back from wanderings which were mere amiable natural weaknesses in the male
Love might adorn a honeymoon or an escapade duty was the proper adornment of a home
Ive just been viewing the wreck with Culver he said as Langdon entered dressed in the extreme of the latest London fashion
Much damage
What didnt go in the storm was carried off by Giddings when he abandoned the ship
But the hulls there andoh Ill get her off and fix her up all right
Always knew Giddings was a rascal
He oozes piety and respectability
Thats the worst kind you have downtown
When a man carries so much character in his faceits like a woman who carries so much color in her cheeks that you know it couldnt have come from the inside
Youre wrong about Giddings
Hes honest enough
Any other man would have done the same in his place
He stayed until there was no hope of saving the ship
All lost but his honorWall Street honor eh
Precisely
After a pause Langdon said Id no idea you held much of your own stock
I thought you controlled through other peoples proxies and made your profits by forcing the stock up or down and getting on the other side of the market
But you see I believe in Woolens replied Dumont
And I believe in it still Langdon
His eyes had in them the look of the fanatic
That concern is breath and blood and life to me and wife and children and parents and brothers and sisters
Ive put my whole self into it
I conceived it
I brought it into the world
I nursed it and brought it up
I made it big and strong and great
Its mine by heaven
MINE
And no man shall take it from me
He was sitting up his face flushed his eyes blazing
Gadhe does look a wild beast
said Langdon to himself
He would have said aloud had Dumont been well Im precious glad I aint the creature those fangs are reaching for
He was about to caution him against exciting himself when Dumont sank back with a cynical smile at his own outburst
But to get down to business he went on
Ive eleven millions of the stock leftabout a hundred and twenty thousand shares
Gladys has fifty thousand shareshow much have you got
Less than ten thousand
And Id have had none at all if my mind hadnt been full of other things as I was sailing
I forgot to tell my broker to sell
Dumont was reflecting
Presently he said Those curs not only took most of my stock and forced the sale of most of my other securities theyve put me in such a light that outside stockholders wouldnt send me their proxies now
To get back control I must smash them and I must also acquire pretty nearly half the shares and hold them till Im firm in the saddle again
Youd better devote yourself for the present to escaping the grave
Why bother about business
Youve got enoughtoo much as it is
Take a holidaygo away and amuse yourself
Dumont smiled
Thats what Im going to do what Im doingamusing myself
I couldnt sleep I couldnt live if I didnt feel that I was on my way back to power
Nowin the present market I couldnt borrow on my Woolens stock
Ive two requests to make of you
Anything thats possible
The first is I want you to lend me four millions or rather negotiate the loan for me as if it were for yourself
Ive got about that amount in Governments in several good railways and in the property here
The place at Saint X is Paulines but the things I can put up would bring four millions and a half at least at forced sale
So youll be well secured
Im asking you to do it instead of doing it myself because if Im to win out the Herron crowd must think Im done for and nearly dead
Langdon was silent several minutes
At last he said Whats your plan
Dumont looked irritatedhe did not like to be questioned to take any one into his confidence
But he restrained his temper and said Im going to make a counterraid
I know where to strike
Are you sure
Dumont frowned
Dont disturb yourself he said coldly
I can arrange the loan in another way
Im asking you only for your own sake Jack Langdon hastily interposed
Of course you can have the money and I dont want your security
Then Ill not borrow through you
Dumont never would accept a favor from any one
He regarded favors as profitable investments but ruinous debts
Ohvery wellIll take the security said Langdon
When do you want the money
It must be covered into my account at the InterState Nationalremember NOT the National Industrial but the InterState National
A million must be deposited todaythe rest by ten oclock tomorrow at the latest
Ill attend to it
Whats your other request
Woolensll take another big drop on Monday and at least two hundred and fifty thousand sharesll be thrown on the market at perhaps an average price of eighteenless rather than more
I want you quietly to organize a syndicate to buy whats offered
They must agree to sell it to me for say two points advance on what they pay for it
Ill put upin your namea million dollars in cash and forfeit it if I dont take the stock off their hands
As Woolens is worth easily double what it now stands at they cant lose
Of course the whole thing must be kept secret
Langdon deliberated this proposal
Finally he said I think brotherinlaw Barrow and his partner and I can manage it
You can assure them theyll make from six hundred thousand to a million on a less than thirty days investment of four millions and a half with no risk whatever
Just about that assented Langdonhe had been carefully brought up by his father to take care of a fortune and was cleverer at figures than he pretended
Do your buying through Tavistock continued Dumont
Give him orders to take on Monday all offerings of National Woolens preferred and common at eighteen or less
Hell understand what to do
But I may be unable to get up the syndicate on such short notice
You must said Dumont
And you will
You can get a move on yourself when you tryI found that out when I was organizing my original combine
One thing morevery important
Learn for me all you canwithout being suspectedabout the FanningSmiths and Great Lakes
He made Langdon go over the matters he was to attend to point by point before he would let him leave
He was asleep when the nurse sent in by Langdon on his way out reached his bedthe sound and peaceful sleep of a veteran campaigner whose nerves are trained to take advantage of every lull
At ten the next morning he sent the nurse out of his room
And close the doors he said and dont come until I ring
He began to use the branch telephone at his bedside calling up Langdon and then Tavistock to assure himself that all was going well
Next he called up in succession five of the great individual moneylenders of Wall Street pledged them to secrecy and made arrangements for them to call upon him at his house at different hours that day and Sunday
Another might have intrusted the making of these arrangements to Culver or Langdon but Dumont never let any one man know enough of his plan of battle to get an idea of the whole
Now for the ammunition he muttered when the last appointment was made
And he rang for Culver
Culver brought him writing materials
Take this order he said as he wrote to the Central Park Safety Deposit vaults and bring me from my compartment the big tin box with my initials in whiteremember IN WHITEon the end of it
Threequarters of an hour later Culver returned halfcarrying halfdragging the box
Dumonts eyes lighted up at sight of it
Ah
he said in a sigh of satisfaction and relief
Put it under the head of the bed here
Thanks
Thats all
The nurse came as Culver left but he sent her away
He supported himself to the door locked it
He took his keys from the nightstand drew out the box and opened it
On the mass of stocks and bonds lay an envelope containing two listsone of the securities in the box that were the property of Gladys Dumont the other of the securities there that were the property of Laura Dumont their mother
His hands shook as he unfolded these lists and a creaking in the walls or flooring made him start and glance round with the look of a surprised thief
But this weakness was momentary
He was soon absorbed in mentally arranging the securities to the best advantage for distribution among the moneylenders as collateral for the cash he purposed to stake in his game
Such thought as he gave to the moral quality of what he was doing with his sisters and his mothers property without asking their consent was altogether favorable to himself
His was a welltrained practical conscience
It often anticipated his drafts upon it for moral support in acts that might at first blush seem criminal or for soothing apologies for acts which were undeniably not QUITE right
This particular act conscience assured him was of the highest moralityunder his own code
For the code enacted by ordinary human beings to guide their foolish little selves he had no more respect than a lion would have for a moral code enacted by and for sheep
The sheep might assert that their code was for lions also but why should that move the lions to anything but amusement
He had made his own codenot by special revelation from the Almighty as did some of his fellow practitioners of high finance but by especial command of his imperial destiny
And it was a strict codeit had earned him his unblemished reputation for inflexible commercial honesty and commercial truthfulness
The foundation principle was his absolute right to the great property he had created
This being granted how could there be immorality in any act whatsoever that might be necessary to hold or regain his kingdom
As well debate the morality of a mother in commandeering bread or even a life to save her baby from death
His kingdom
His by discovery his by adroit appropriation his by intelligent development his by the right of mental mightHIS
Stake his sisters and his mothers possessions for it
Their lives if necessary
Than John Dumont president of the Woolens Monopoly there was no firmer believer in the gospel of divine rightthe divine right of this new race of kings the puissant lords of trade
When he had finished his preparations for the moneylenders he unlocked the door and sank into bed exhausted
Hardly had he settled himself when without knocking Gladys entered Pauline just behind her
His face blanched and from his dry throat came a hoarse strange cryit certainly sounded like fright
You startled methat was all he hastened to explain as much to himself as to them
For a something inside him had echoed the wondering inquiry in the two womens facesa something that persisted in reverencing the moral code which his new code had superseded
XXVII
THE OTHER MANS MIGHT
At eleven oclock on Monday morning James head of the FanningSmith family president of FanningSmith and Company and chairman of the Great Lakes and Gulf railwayto note his chief titles to eminence uptown and downwas seated in his grandfathers office in his grandfathers chair at his grandfathers desk
Above his head hung his grandfathers portrait and he was a slightly modernized reproduction of it
As he was thus in every outward essential his grandfather over again he and his family and the social and business world assumed that he was the reincarnation of the crafty old fox who first saw the light of day through the chinks in a farmhands cottage in Maine and last saw it as it sifted through the reallace curtains of his gorgeous bedroom in his great Madison Avenue mansion
But in fact James was only physically and titularly the representative of his grandfather
Actually he was typical of the present generation of FanningSmithsa selfintoxicated stupid and pretentious generation a poloplaying and racing and hunting a yachting and palacedwelling and moneyscattering generation a businessdespising and businessneglecting an oldworld aristocracyimitating generation
He moved pompously through his two worlds fashion and business deceiving himself completely every one else except his wife more or less her not at allbut that was the one secret she kept
James was the husband of Herrons daughter by his first wife and Herron had induced him to finance the syndicate that had raided and captured National Woolens
James was bred to conservatism
His timidity was of that wholesome strength which so often saves chuckleheads from the legitimate consequences of their vanity and folly
But the spectacle of huge fortunes risen overnight before the wands of financial magicians whose abilities he despised when he compared them with his own was too much for timidity
He had been born with a large vanity and it had been stuffed from his babyhood by all around him until it was become as abnormal as the liver of a Strasburg gooseand as supersensitive
It suffered acutely as these Jacks went climbing up their beanstalk wealth to heights of magnificence from which the establishments and equipages of the FanningSmiths must seem poor to shabbiness
He sneered at them as vulgar newcomers he professed abhorrence of their ostentation
But heand Gertrude his wifeenvied them talked of them constantly longed to imitate to surpass them
In the fullness of time his temptation came
He shivered shrank leaped headlonghis wife pushing
About ten days before the raid on National Woolens there had drifted in to Dumont through one of his many subterranean sources of information a rumor that the FanningSmiths had stealthily reduced their holdings of Great Lakes to twentyone thousand shares and that the property was not so good as it had once been
He never permitted any Wall Street development to pass unexplainedhe thought it simple prudence for a man with the care of a great financial and commercial enterprise to look into every dark corner of the Street and see what was hatching there
Accordingly he sent an inquiry back along his secret avenue
Soon he learned that Great Lakes was sound but the FanningSmiths had gone rotten that they were gambling in the stock of the road they controlled and were supposed in large part to own that they were secretly selling its stock shortthat is were betting it would go downwhen there was nothing in the condition of the property to justify a fall
He reflected on this situation and reached these conclusions James FanningSmith purposes to pass the autumn dividend which will cause the stock to drop
Then he will take his profits from the shares he has sold short and will buy back control at the low price
He is a fool and a knave
Only an imbecile would thus trifle with an established property
A chance for some one to make a fortune and win a railroad by smashing the FanningSmiths
Having recorded in his indelible memory these facts and conclusions as to James FanningSmiths plunge from business into gambling Dumont returned to his own exacting affairs
He had himself begun the race for multimillions as a gambler and had only recently become ALMOST altogether a business man
But he thought there was a radical difference between his case and FanningSmiths
To use courageous gambling as means to a foothold in businesshe regarded that as wise audacity
To use a firmestablished foothold in business as a means to gamblinghe regarded that as the acme of reckless folly
Besides when he marked the cards or loaded the dice for a great Wall Street game of high finance he did it with skill and intelligence and FanningSmith had neither
When the bankinghouse of FanningSmith and Company undertook to finance the raid on National Woolens it was already deep in the Great Lakes gamble
James was new to Wall Streets green table and he liked the sensations and felt that his swindle on other gamblers and the publiche did not call it by that homely name though he knew others would if they found him outwas moving smoothly
Still very very deep down his selfconfidence was underlaid with quicksand
But Herron was adroit and convincing to the degree attainable only by those who deceive themselves before trying to deceive others and James cupidity and conceit were enormous
He ended by persuading himself that his house directed and protected by his invincible self could carry with ease the burden of both loads
Indeed the Great Lakes gamble now seemed to him a negligible trifle in the comparisonwhat were its profits of a few hundred thousands beside the millions that would surely be his when the great Woolens Monopoly bought in for a small fraction of its value should be controlled by a group of which he would be the dominant personality
He ventured he won
He was now securewas not Dumont dispossessed despoiled dying
At eleven oclock on that Monday morning he was seated upon his embossed leather throne under his grandfathers portrait immersed in an atmosphere of selfadoration
At intervals he straightened himself distended his chest elevated his chin and glanced round with an air of haughty dignity though there was none to witness and to be impressed
In Wall Street there is a fatuity which always epidemic among the small fry infects wise and foolish great and small whenever a paretic dream of an enormous haul at a single cast of the net happens to come true
This paretic fatuity now had possession of James in imagination he was crowning and draping himself with multimillions power and fame
At intervals he had been calling up on the telephone at his elbow Zabriskie the firms representative on Change and had been spurring him on to larger and more frequent sales of Great Lakes
His telephone bell rang
He took down the receiverYes its Mr FanningSmithohMr Fanshaw He listened in his face for the first few seconds all the pitying amusement a small vain man can put into an expression of superiority
Thank you Mr Fanshaw he said
But really its impossible
WE are perfectly secure
No one would venture to disturb US
And he pursed his lips and swelled his fat cheeks in the look for which his father was noted
But after listening a few seconds longer his eyes had in them the beginnings of timidity
He turned his head so that he could see the tickertape as it reeled off
His heavy cheeks slowly relaxed
Yes yes he said hurriedly
Ill just speak to our Mr Zabriskie
Goodby
And he rang off and had his telephone connected with the telephone Zabriskie was using at the Stock Exchange
All the while his eyes were on the tickertape
Suddenly he saw upon it where it was bending from under the turning wheel a figure that made him drop the receiver and seize it in both his trembling hands
Great heavens
he gasped
Fanshaw may be right
Great Lakes one hundred and twelveand only a moment ago it was one hundred and three
His visions of wealth and power and fame were whisking off in a gale of terror
A new quotation was coming from under the wheelGreat Lakes one hundred and fifteen
In his eyes stared the awful thought that was raging in his brainThis may mean And his vanity instantly thrust out Herron and Gertrude and pointed at them as the criminals who would be responsible ifhe did not dare formulate the possibilities of that bounding price
The telephone boy at the other end going in search of Zabriskie left the receiver off the hook and the door of the booth open
Into FanningSmiths ear came the tumult from the floor of the Exchangeshrieks and yells riding a roar like the breakers of an infernal sea
And on the tickertape James was reading the story of the cause was reading how his Great Lakes venture was caught in those breakers was rushing upon the rocks amid the despairing wails of its crew the triumphant jeers of the wreckers on shore
Great Lakes one hundred and eighteentickticktickGreat Lakes one hundred and twentythreetickticktickGreat Lakes one hundred and thirtytickticktickGreat Lakes one hundred and thirtyfive It cant be true
he moaned
It CANT be true
If it is Im ruinedall of us ruined
The roar in the receiver lessenedsome one had entered the booth at the other end and had closed the door
Well
he heard in a sharp impatient voiceZabriskies
What is it Nedwhats the matter
Why didnt you tell me
FanningSmiths voice was like the shrill shriek of a coward in a perilous storm
It was in itself complete explanation of Zabriskies neglect to call upon him for orders
Dont ask me
Somebodys rocketing Great Lakestaking all offerings
Dont keep me here
Im having a hard enough time watching this crazy market and sending our orders by the roundabout way
Got anything to suggest
TickticktickCommanderinchief FanningSmith watched the crawling tape in fascinated horrorGreat Lakes one hundred and thirtyeight
It had spelled out for him another letter of that hideous word Ruin
All the moisture of his body seemed to be on the outside inside he was dry and hot as a desert
If the price went no higher if it did not come down nearly all he had in the world would be needed to settle his short contracts
For he would have to deliver at one hundred and seven more than two hundred thousand shares which he had contracted to sell and to get them for delivery he would have to pay one hundred and thirtyeight dollars a share
A net loss of more than six millions
You must get that price downyou must
You MUST
quavered James
Hell
exclaimed Zabriskiehe was the youngest member of the firm a son of James oldest sister
Tell me how and Ill do it
Youre thereyou know what to do pleaded James
And I order you to get that price down
Dont keep me here talking rot
Ive been fightingand Im going to keep on
James shivered
Fighting
There was no fight in himall his life he had got everything without fighting
Do your best he said
Im very ill today
Im Goodby Zabriskie had hung up the receiver
James sat staring at the tape like a paralytic staring at death
The minutes lengthened into an hourinto two hours
No one disturbed himwhen the battle is on who thinks of the honorary commander
At one oclock he shook himself brushed his hand over his eyesquotations of Woolens were reeling off the tape alternating with quotations of Great Lakes
Zabriskie is selling our Woolens he thought
Then with a blinding flash the truth struck through his brain
He gave a loud cry between a sob and a shriek and flinging his arms at full length upon his desk buried his face between them and burst into tears
Ruined
Ruined
Ruined
And his shoulders his whole body shook like a child in a paroxysm
A long long ring at the telephone
FanningSmith irritated by the insistent jingling so close to his ear lifted himself and answeredthe tears were guttering his swollen face his lips and eyelids were twitching
Well
he said feebly
Weve got em on the run came the reply in Zabriskies voice jubilant now
Who
Dont know whowhoever was trying to squeeze us
I had to throw over some Woolensbut Ill pick it up againmaybe today
FanningSmith could hear the roar of the Exchangewilder fiercer than three hours before but music to him now
He looked sheepishly at the portrait of his grandfather
When its eyes met his he flushed and shifted his gaze guiltily
Must have been something I ate for breakfast he muttered to the portrait and to himself in apologetic explanation of his breakdown
In a distant part of the field all this time was posted the commanderinchief of the army of attack
Like all wise commanders in all wellconducted battles he was far removed from the blinding smoke from the distracting confusion
He had placed himself where he could hear see instantly direct without being disturbed by trifling reverse or success by unimportant rumors to vast proportions blown
To play his game for dominion or destruction John Dumont had had himself arrayed in a winecolored wadded silk dressinggown over his white silk pajamas and had stretched himself on a divan in his sittingroom in his palace
A telephone and a stockticker within easy reach were his fieldglasses and his aidesthe stockticker would show him second by second the precise posture of the battle the telephone would enable him to direct it to the minutest manoeuver
The telephone led to the ear of his chief of staff Tavistock who was at his desk in his privatest office in the Mills Building about him telephones straight to the ears of the division commanders
None of these knew who was his commander indeed none knew that there was to be a battle or after the battle was on that they were part of one of its two contending armies
They would blindly obey orders ignorant who was aiming the guns they fired and at whom those guns were aimed
Such conditions would have been fatal to the barbaric struggles for supremacy which ambition has waged through all the past they are ideal conditions for these modern conflicts of the market which more and more absorb the ambitions of men
Instead of shot and shell and regiments of cannon food there are battalions of capital the paper certificates of the storedup toil or trickery of men instead of mangled bodies and dead there are minds in the torment of financial peril or numb with the despair of financial ruin
But the stakes are the same old stakespower and glory and wealth for a few thousands on thousands dragged or cozened into the battle in whose victory they share scantily if at all although they bear its heaviest losses on both sides
It was halfpast eight oclock when Dumont put the receiver to his ear and greeted Tavistock in a strong cheerful voice
Never felt better in my life was his answer to Tavistocks inquiry as to his health
Even old Sackett admits Im in condition
But he says I must have no irritationsso be careful to carry out orders
He felt as well as he said
His body seemed the better for its rest and purification for its long freedom from his occasional but terrific assaults upon it for having got rid of the superfluous flesh which had been swelling and weighting it
He made Tavistock repeat all the orders he had given him to assure himself he had not been misunderstood
As he listened to the rehearsal of his own shrewd plans his eyes sparkled
Ill bag the lastof them he muttered and his lips twisted into a smile at which Culver winced
When the ticker clicked the first quotation of Great Lakes Dumont said Now clear out Culver
And shut the door after you and let no one interrupt me until I call
He wished to have no restraint upon his thoughts no eyes to watch his face no ears to hear what the fortune of the battle might wring from him
As the ticker pushed out the news of the early declines and recoveries in Great Lakes Tavistock leading the FanningSmith crowd on to make heavier and heavier plunges Dumont could see in imagination the battlefieldthe floor of the Stock Exchangeas plainly as if he were there
The battle began with a languid cannonade between the two seemingly opposed parts of Dumonts army
Under cover of this he captured most of the available actual shares of Great Lakesvaluable aids toward making his position his corner impregnable
But before he had accomplished his full purpose Zabriskie nominal lieutenantcommander actual commander of the FanningSmith forces advanced to give battle
Instead of becoming suspicious at the steadiness of the price under his attacks upon it Zabriskie was lured on to sell more of those Great Lakes shares which he did not have
And he beamed from his masked position as he thought of the batteries he was holding in reserve for his grand movement to batter down the price of the stock late in the day and capture these backers of the property that was supposed to be under the protection of the high and honorable FanningSmiths
He was still thinking along this line as he stood aloof and apparently disinterested when Dumont began to close in upon him
Zabriskie astonished by this sudden tremendous fire was alarmed when under its protection the price advanced
He assaulted in force with large selling orders but the price pushed on and the fierce cannonade of larger and larger buying orders kept up
When Great Lakes had mounted in a dozen bounds from one hundred and seven to one hundred and thirtynine he for the first time realized that he was facing not an unorganized speculating public but a compact army directed by a single mind to a single purpose
A lunatica lot of lunatics he said having not the faintest suspicion of the reason for the creation of these conditions of frenzy
Still if this rise continued or was not reversed the FanningSmiths would be ruinedby whom
Some of those Chicago bluffers he finally decided
I must throw a scare into I them
He could have withdrawn from the battle then with a pitiful remnant of the FanningSmiths and their associatesthat is he thought he could for he did not dream of the existence of the corner
But he chose the opposite course
He flung off his disguise and boldly attacked the stock with selling orders openly in the name of the FanningSmiths
When they see us apparently unloading our own ancestral property I think theyll take to their heels he said
But his face was pale as he awaited the effect of his assault
The price staggered trembled
The clamor of the battle alarmed those in the galleries of the Stock ExchangeZabriskies brokers selling the brokers of the mysterious speculator buying the speculating public through its brokers joining in on either side men shrieking into each others faces as they danced round and round the Great Lakes pillar
The price went down went up went down down downZabriskie had hurled selling orders for nearly fifty thousand shares at it and Dumont had commanded his guns to cease firing
He did not dare take any more offerings he had reached the end of the ammunition he had planned to expend at that particular stage of the battle
The alarm spread and although Zabriskie ceased selling the price continued to fall under the assaults of the speculating public mad to get rid of that which its own best friends were so eagerly and so frankly throwing over
Down down down to one hundred and twenty to one hundred and ten to one hundred and five Zabriskie telephoned victory to his nominal commander lifting him weak and trembling from the depths into which he had fallen to an at least upright position upon his embossed leather throne
Then Zabriskie began stealthily to cover his appallingly long line of shorts by making purchases at the lowest obtainable pricesone hundred and fourone hundred and threeone hundred and oneninetynineone hundred and six
The price rebounded so rapidly and so high that Zabriskie was forced to stop his retreat
Dumont noting the celerity with which the enemy were escaping under cover of the demoralization had decided no longer to delay the move for which he had saved himself
He had suddenly exploded under the falling price mine after mine of buying orders that blew it skyward
Zabriskies retreat was cut off
But before he had time to reason out this savage renewal of the assault by that mysterious foe whom he thought he had routed he saw a new and more dreadful peril
Brackett his firms secret broker rushed to him and to make himself heard through the hurlyburly shouted into his ear Look whats doing in Woolens
Dumont had ordered a general assault upon his enemies front rear and both flanks
His forces were now attacking not only through Great Lakes but also through Woolens
Two apparently opposing sets of his brokers were trading in Woolens were hammering the price down down a point an eighth a half a quarter at a time
The sweat burst out all over Zabriskies body and his eyes rolled wildly
He was caught among four fires To continue to sell Great Lakes in face of its rising pricethat was ruin
To cease to sell it and so let its price go up to where he could not buy when settlement time camethat was ruin
To sell Woolens to help batter down its price to shrink the value of his enormous investment in itruin again
To buy Woolens in order to hold up its price to do it when he would need all obtainable cash to extricate him from the Great Lakes entanglementruin certain ruin
His judgment was gone his brute instinct of fighting was dominant he began to strike out wildly his blows falling either nowhere or upon himself
At the Woolens post he was buying in the effort to sustain its price buying stock that might be worthless when he got itand that he might not be able to pay for
At the Great Lakes post he was selling in the effort to force the price down selling more and more of a stock he did not have and At last the thought flashed into his befuddled brain There may be a corner in Great Lakes
What if there were no stock to be had
He struck his hands against the sides of his head
Trapped
he groaned then bellowed in Bracketts ear
Sell Woolensdo the best you can to keep the price up but sell at any price
We must have moneyall we can get
And tell FarleyFarley was Bracketts partnerto buy Great Lakesbuy all he can getat any price
Somebodys trying to corner us
He feltwith an instinct he could not questionthat there was indeed a corner in Great Lakes that he and his house and their associates were caught
Caught with promises to deliver thousands upon thousands of shares of Great Lakes when Great Lakes could be had only of the mysterious cornerer and at whatever price he might choose to ask
If weve got to go down he said to himself Ill see that its a tremendous smash anyhow and that we aint alone in it
For he had in him the stuff that makes a man lead a forlorn hope with a certain joy in the very hopelessness of it
The scene on the day of Dumonts downfall was a calm in comparison with the scene which Dumont sitting alone among the piledup coils of tickertape was reconstructing from its to him vivid secondbysecond sketchings
The mysterious force which had produced a succession of earthquakes moved horribly on still in mystery impenetrable to produce a cataclysm
In the midst of the chaos two vast whirlpools formedone where Great Lakes sucked down men and fortunes the other where Woolens drew some down to destruction flung others up to wealth
Then Rumor released by Tavistock when Dumont saw that the crisis had arrived ran hot foot through the Exchange screaming into the ears of the brokers shrieking through the telephones howling over the telegraph wires A corner
A corner
Great Lakes is cornered
Thousands besides the FanningSmith coterie had been gambling in Great Lakes had sold shares they did not have
And now all knew that to get them they must go to the unknown but doubtless merciless mastergamblerunless they could save themselves by instantly buying elsewhere before the steel jaws of the corner closed and clinched
Reason fled and selfcontrol
The veneer of civilization was torn away to the last shred and men turned brute again gave themselves up to the elemental passions of the brute
In the quiet beautiful room in upper Fifth Avenue was Dumont in his winecolored wadded silk dressinggown and white silk pajamas
The floor near his lounge was littered with the snakelike coils of tickertape
They rose almost to his knees as he sat and through telephone and ticker drank in the massacre of his making glutted himself with the joy of the vengeance he was takingon his enemies on his false or feeble friends on the fickle public that had trampled and spat upon him
His wet hair was hanging in strings upon his forehead
His face was flushed and his greengray eyes gleamed like a mad dogs
At intervals a jeer or a grunt of gratified appetite ripped from his mouth or nose
Like a great lean spider he lay hid in the center of that vast net of electric wires watching his prey writhe helpless
Pauline made uneasy by his long isolation opened his door and lookedglanced rather
As she closed it in haste to shut from view that spectacle of a hungry monster at its banquet of living flesh Culver saw her face
Such an expression an angel might have did it chance to glance down from the battlements of heaven and before it could turn away catch a glimpse of some orgy in hell
But Dumont did not hear the door open and close
He was at the climax of his feast
Upon his two maelstroms sucking in the wreckage from a dozen other explosions as well as from those he had directly caused he could see as well as if he were among the fascinated horrified spectators in the galleries of the Exchange the mangled flotsam whirling and descending and ascending
The entire stock list the entire speculating public of the country was involved
And expression of the emotions everywhere was by telegraph and telephone concentrated in the one hall upon the faces and bodies of those few hundred brokers
All the passions which love of wealth and dread of want breed in the human animal were there finding ventall degrees and shades and modes of greed of hate of fear of despair
It was like a shipwreck where the whole fleet is flung upon the reefs and the sailors drunk and insane struggle with death each in his own awful way
It was like the rout where frenzied victors ride after and among frenzied vanquished to shoot and stab and saber
And while this battle precipitated by the passions of a few captains of industry raged in Wall Street and filled the nation with the clamor of ruined or triumphant gamblers tenscore thousand toilers in the two great enterprises directly involved toiled tranquilly onherding sheep and shearing them weaving cloths and dyeing them driving engines handling freight conducting trains usefully busy adding to the sum of human happiness subtracting from the sum of human misery
At three oclock Dumont sank back among his cushions and pillows
His child his other self his Woolens Monopoly was again his own his enemies were under his heel as much so as those heaps and coils of tickertape he had been churning in his excitement
Im dead tired he muttered his face ghastly his body relaxed in utter exhaustion
He closed his eyes
I must sleepIve earned it
Tomorrowa smile flitted round his mouthIll hang their hides where every coyote and vulture can see
Toward four oclock in came Doctor Sackett and Culver
The room was flooded with lightthe infinite light of the latespring afternoon reflected on the white enamel and white brocade of walls and furniture
On the floor in the heaps and coils of tickertape lay Dumont
In his struggles the tape had wound round and round his legs his arms his neck
It lay in a curling coiling mat like a serpents head upon his throat where his hands clutched the collar of his pajamas
Sackett knelt beside him listening at his chest feeling for his pulse in vain
And Culver stood by staring stupidly at the now worthless instrument of his ambition for wealth and power
XXVIII
AFTER THE LONG WINTER
Within two hours Langdon in full control had arranged with Tavistock to make the imperiled victory secure
Thus not until the next day but one did it come out that the cataclysm had been caused by a man ruined and broken and with his back against deaths door to hold it shut that Dumont himself had turned the triumphing host of his enemies into a flying mob in its panic flinging away its own possessions as well as its booty
Perhaps the truth never would have been known perhaps Langdon would have bribed Tavistock to silence and would have posed as the conquering genius had he found out a day earlier how Dumont had put himself in funds
As it was this discovery did not come too late for him to seize the opportunity that was his through Dumonts secret methods Paulines indifference to wealth and his own unchecked authority
He has got many an hour ofstrictly privatemental gymnastics out of the moral problem he saw in his keeping for himself and Gladys the spoils he gathered up
He is inclined to think he was intelligent rather than right but knowing his weakness for selfcriticism he never gives a positive verdict against himself
That however is unimportant as he is not the man to permit conscience to influence conduct in grave matters
He feels that in any case he did not despoil Pauline or Gardiner
For after he had told her what Dumont didand to protect himself he hastened to tell itshe said Whatever there may be its all for Gardiner
I waive my own rights if I have any
But you must give me your word of honor that you wont let anything tainted pass to him
Langdon judging with the delicacy of a man of honor put on honor was able to find little such wealth
He gives himself most of the credit for Gardiners turning out so wellInherited riches are a hopeless handicap he often says to Gladys when they are talking over the future of their children
Pauline The first six months of her new life of her resumed life she spent in Europe with her father and mother and Gardiner
Late in the fall they were back at Saint X at the old house in Jefferson Street
In the following June came Scarborough
She was in the garden was waiting for him was tying up a tall rose whose splendid haughty head had bent under the nights rain
He was quite near her when she heard his step and turned
He stood looked at herthe look she had seen that last afternoon at Battle Field
He came slowly up and took both her hands
After all the waiting and longing and hoping he said at lastyou
I cant put it into wordsexcept to sayjustPauline
She drew a long breath her gaze met his
And in her eyes he saw a flame that had never shone clearly there beforethe fire of her own real self free and proud
Once you told me about your father and motherhow he caredcared always
I remember he answered
WellII said Pauline I care as SHE must have cared when she gave him herselfand YOU
