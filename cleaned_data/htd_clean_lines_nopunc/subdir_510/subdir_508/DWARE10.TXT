by Harold Frederic PART I CHAPTER I No such throng had ever before been seen in the building during all its eight years of existence
People were wedged together most uncomfortably upon the seats they stood packed in the aisles and overflowed the galleries at the back in the shadows underneath these galleries they formed broad dense masses about the doors through which it would be hopeless to attempt a passage
The light given out from numerous tinlined circles of flaring gasjets arranged on the ceiling fell full upon a thousand uplifted facessome framed in bonnets or juvenile curls others bearded or crowned with shining baldnessbut all alike under the spell of a dominant emotion which held features in abstracted suspense and focussed every eye upon a common objective point
The excitement of expectancy reigned upon each row of countenances was visible in every attitude nay seemed a part of the close overheated atmosphere itself
An observer looking over these compact lines of faces and noting the uniform concentration of eagerness they exhibited might have guessed that they were watching for either the jurys verdict in some peculiarly absorbing criminal trial or the announcement of the lucky numbers in a great lottery
These two expressions seemed to alternate and even to mingle vaguely upon the upturned lineaments of the waiting throngthe hope of some unnamed stroke of fortune and the dread of some adverse decree
But a glance forward at the object of this universal gaze would have sufficed to shatter both hypotheses
Here was neither a court of justice nor a tombola
It was instead the closing session of the annual Nedahma Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Bishop was about to read out the list of ministerial appointments for the coming year
This list was evidently written in a hand strange to him and the slow nearsighted old gentleman having at last sufficiently rubbed the glasses of his spectacles and then adjusted them over his nose with annoying deliberation was now silently rehearsing his task to himself the while the clergymen round about ground their teeth and restlessly shuffled their feet in impatience
Upon a closer inspection of the assemblage there were a great many of these clergymen
A dozen or more dignified and for the most part elderly brethren sat grouped about the Bishop in the pulpit
As many others not quite so staid in mien and indeed with here and there almost a suggestion of frivolity in their postures were seated on the steps leading down from this platform
A score of their fellows sat facing the audience on chairs tightly wedged into the space railed off round the pulpit and then came five or six rows of pews stretching across the whole breadth of the church and almost solidly filled with preachers of the Word
There were very old men among thesebent and decrepit veterans who had known Lorenzo Dow and had been ordained by elders who remembered Francis Asbury and even Whitefield
They sat now in front places leaning forward with trembling and misshapen hands behind their hairy ears waiting to hear their names read out on the superannuated list it might be for the last time
The sight of these venerable Fathers in Israel was good to the eyes conjuring up as it did pictures of a time when a plain and homely people had been served by a fervent and devoted clergyby preachers who lacked in learning and polish no doubt but who gave their lives without dream of earthly reward to poverty and to the danger and wearing toil of itinerant missions through the rude frontier settlements
These pictures had for their primitive accessories loghuts rough household implements coarse clothes and patched old saddles which told of weary years of journeying but to even the least sympathetic vision there shone upon them the glorified light of the Cross and Crown
Reverend survivors of the heroic times their very presence theresitting meekly at the altarrail to hear again the published record of their uselessness and of their dependence upon church charitywas in the nature of a benediction
The large majority of those surrounding these patriarchs were middleaged men generally of a robust type with burly shoulders and bushing beards framing shaven upper lips and who looked for the most part like honest and prosperous farmers attired in their Sunday clothes
As exceptions to this rule there were scattered stray specimens of a more urban class worthies with neatly trimmed whiskers white neckcloths and even indications of hairoilall eloquent of citified charges and now and again the eye singled out a striking and scholarly face at once strong and simple and instinctively referred it to the faculty of one of the several theological seminaries belonging to the Conference
The effect of these faces as a whole was toward goodness candor and imperturbable selfcomplacency rather than learning or mental astuteness and curiously enough it wore its pleasantest aspect on the countenances of the older men
The impress of zeal and moral worth seemed to diminish by regular gradations as one passed to younger faces and among the very beginners who had been ordained only within the past day or two this decline was peculiarly marked
It was almost a relief to note the relative smallness of their number so plainly was it to be seen that they were not the men their forbears had been
And if those aged wornout preachers facing the pulpit had gazed instead backward over the congregation it may be that here too their old eyes would have detected a differencewhat at least they would have deemed a decline
But nothing was further from the minds of the members of the First M E Church of Tecumseh than the suggestion that they were not an improvement on those who had gone before them
They were undoubtedly the smartest and most important congregation within the limits of the Nedahma Conference and this new church edifice of theirs represented alike a scale of outlay and a standard of progressive taste in devotional architecture unique in the Methodism of that whole section of the State
They had a right to be proud of themselves too
They belonged to the substantial order of the community with perhaps not so many very rich men as the Presbyterians had but on the other hand with far fewer extremely poor folk than the Baptists were encumbered with
The pews in the first four rows of their church rented for one hundred dollars apiece quite up to the Presbyterian highwater markand they now had almost abolished free pews altogether
The oyster suppers given by their Ladies Aid Society in the basement of the church during the winter had established rank among the fashionable events in Tecumsehs social calendar
A comprehensive and satisfied perception of these advantages was uppermost in the minds of this local audience as they waited for the Bishop to begin his reading
They had entertained this Bishop and his Presiding Elders and the rank and file of common preachers in a style which could not have been remotely approached by any other congregation in the Conference
Where else one would like to know could the Bishop have been domiciled in a Methodist house where he might have a sittingroom all to himself with his bedroom leading out of it
Every clergyman present had been provided for in a private residenceeven down to the Licensed Exhorters who were not really ministers at all when you came to think of it and who might well thank their stars that the Conference had assembled among such openhanded people
There existed a dim feeling that these Licensed Exhorters an uncouth crew with country storekeepers and lumbermen and even a horsedoctor among their numberhad taken rather too much for granted and were not exhibiting quite the proper degree of gratitude over their reception
But a more important issue hung now imminent in the balance was Tecumseh to be fairly and honorably rewarded for her hospitality by being given the pastor of her choice
All were agreedat least among those who paid pewrents upon the great importance of a change in the pulpit of the First M E Church
A change in persons must of course take place for their present pastor had exhausted the threeyear maximum of the itinerant system but there was needed much more than that
For a handsome and expensive church building like this and with such a modern and goahead congregation it was simply a vital necessity to secure an attractive and fashionable preacher
They had held their own against the Presbyterians these past few years only by the most strenuous efforts and under the depressing disadvantage of a minister who preached dreary outofdate sermons and who lacked even the most rudimentary sense of social distinctions
The Presbyterians had captured the new cashier of the Adams County Bank who had always gone to the Methodist Church in the town he came from but now was lost solely because of this tiresome old fossil of theirs and there were numerous other instances of the same sort scarcely less grievous
That this state of things must be altered was clear
The unusually large local attendance upon the sessions of the Conference had given some of the more guileless of visiting brethren a high notion of Tecumsehs piety and perhaps even the most sophisticated stranger never quite realized how strictly it was to be explained by the anxiety to pick out a suitable champion for the fierce Presbyterian competition
Big gatherings assembled evening after evening to hear the sermons of those selected to preach and the church had been almost impossibly crowded at each of the three Sunday services
Opinions had naturally differed a good deal during the earlier stages of this scrutiny but after last nights sermon there could be but one feeling
The man for Tecumseh was the Reverend Theron Ware
The choice was an admirable one from points of view much more exalted than those of the local congregation
You could see Mr Ware sitting there at the end of the row inside the altarrailthe tall slender young man with the broad white brow thoughtful eyes and features moulded into that regularity of strength which used to characterize the American Senatorial type in those faraway days of cleanshaven faces and moderate incomes before the War
The brightfaced comely and vivacious young woman in the second side pew was his wifeand Tecumseh noted with approbation that she knew how to dress
There were really no two better or worthier people in the building than this young couple who sat waiting along with the rest to hear their fate
But unhappily they had come to know of the effort being made to bring them to Tecumseh and their simple pride in the triumph of the husbands fine sermon had become swallowed up in a terribly anxious conflict of hope and fear
Neither of them could maintain a satisfactory show of composure as the decisive moment approached
The vision of translation from poverty and obscurity to such a splendid post as thistruly it was too dazzling for tranquil nerves
The tedious Bishop had at last begun to call his roll of names and the good people of Tecumseh mentally ticked them off one by one as the list expanded
They felt that it was like this Bishopan unimportant and commonplace figure in Methodism not to be mentioned in the same breath with Simpson and Janes and Kingsley that he should begin with the backwoods counties and thrust all these remote and pitifully rustic stations ahead of their own metropolitan charge
To these they listened but listlesslyindifferent alike to the joy and to the dismay which he was scattering among the divines before him
The announcements were being doled out with stumbling hesitation
After each one a little halfrustling movement through the crowded rows of clergymen passed mute judgment upon the cruel blow this brother had received the reward justly given to this other the favoritism by which a third had profited
The Presiding Elders whose work all this was stared with gloomy and impersonal abstraction down upon the rows of blackcoated humanity spread before them
The ministers returned this fixed and perfunctory gaze with pale set faces only feebly masking the emotions which each new name stirred somewhere among them
The Bishop droned on laboriously mispronouncing words and repeating himself as if he were reading a catalogue of unfamiliar seeds
First church of TecumsehBrother Abram G
Tisdale
There was no doubt about it
These were actually the words that had been uttered
After all this outlay all this lavish hospitality all this sacrifice of time and patience in sitting through those sermons to draw from the grabbag nothing better thana Tisdale
A hum of outraged astonishmenthalf groan half wrathful snort bounded along from pew to pew throughout the body of the church
An echo of it reached the Bishop and so confused him that he haltingly repeated the obnoxious line
Every local eye turned as by intuition to where the calamitous Tisdale sat and fastened malignantly upon him
Could anything be worse
This Brother Tisdale was past fifty a spindling rickety gaunt old man with a long horselike head and vacantly solemn face who kept one or the other of his hands continually fumbling his bony jaw
He had been withdrawn from routine service for a number of years doing a little insurance canvassing on his own account and also travelling for the Book Concern
Now that he wished to return to parochial work the richest prize in the whole list Tecumseh was given to him to him who had never been asked to preach at a Conference and whose archaic nasal singing of Greenlands Icy Mountains  had made even the Licensed Exhorters grin
It was too intolerably dreadful to think of
An embittered whisper to the effect that Tisdale was the Bishops cousin ran round from pew to pew
This did not happen to be true but indignant Tecumseh gave it entire credit
The throngs about the doors dwindled as by magic and the aisles cleared
Local interest was dead and even some of the pewholders rose and made their way out
One of these murmured audibly to his neighbors as he departed that HIS pew could be had now for sixty dollars
So it happened that when a little later on the appointment of Theron Ware to Octavius was read out none of the people of Tecumseh either noted or cared
They had been deeply interested in him so long as it seemed likely that he was to come to thembefore their clearly expressed desire for him had been so monstrously ignored
But now what became of him was no earthly concern of theirs
After the Doxology had been sung and the Conference formally declared ended the Wares would fain have escaped from the flood of handshakings and boisterous farewells which spread over the front part of the church
But the clergymen were unusually insistent upon demonstrations of cordiality among themselvesthe more perhaps because it was evident that the friendliness of their local hosts had suddenly evaporatedand of all men in the world the present incumbent of the Octavius pulpit now bore down upon them with noisy effusiveness and defied evasion
Brother Warewe have never been interducedbut let me clasp your hand
AndSister Ware I presume yours too
He was a portly man who held his head back so that his face seemed all jowl and mouth and sandy chinwhisker
He smiled broadly upon them with halfclosed eyes and shook hands again
I said to em he went on with loud pretence of heartiness the minute I heerd your name called out for our dear Octavius I must go over an interduce myself
It will be a heavy cross to part with those dear people Brother Ware but if anything could wean me to the notion so to speak it would be the knowledge that you are to take up my labors in their midst
Perhapsahperhaps they ARE jest a trifle close in money matters but they come out strong on revivals
Theyll need a good deal o stirrin up about parsonage expenses but oh
such seasons of grace as weve experienced there together
He shook his head and closed his eyes altogether as if transported by his memories
Brother Ware smiled faintly in decorous response and bowed in silence but his wife resented the unctuous beaming of content on the others wide countenance and could not restrain her tongue
You seem to bear up tolerably well under this heavy cross as you call it she said sharply
The will o the Lord Sister Warethe will o the Lord
he responded disposed for the instant to put on his pompous manner with her and then deciding to smile again as he moved off
The circumstance that he was to get an additional three hundred dollars yearly in his new place was not mentioned between them
By a mutual impulse the young couple when they had at last gained the cool open air crossed the street to the side where overhanging trees shaded the infrequent lamps and they might be comparatively alone
The wife had taken her husbands arm and pressed closely upon it as they walked
For a time no word passed but finally he said in a grave voice It is hard upon you poor girl
Then she stopped short buried her face against his shoulder and fell to sobbing
He strove with gentle whispered remonstrance to win her from this mood and after a few moments she lifted her head and they resumed their walk she wiping her eyes as they went
I couldnt keep it in a minute longer
she said catching her breath between phrases
Oh WHY do they behave so badly to us Theron
He smiled down momentarily upon her as they moved along and patted her hand
Somebody must have the poor places Alice he said consolingly
I am a young man yet remember
We must take our turn and be patient
For we know that all things work together for good
And your sermon was so headandshoulders above all the others
she went on breathlessly
Everybody said so
And Mrs Parshall heard it so DIRECT that you were to be sent here and I know she told everybody how much I was lotting on itI wish we could go right off tonight without going to her houseI shall be ashamed to look her in the faceand of course she knows were poked off to that miserable OctaviusWhy Theron they tell me its a worse place even than weve got now
Oh not at all he put in reassuringly
It has grown to be a large townoh quite twice the size of Tyre
Its a great Irish place Ive heard
Our own church seems to be a good deal run down there
We must build it up again and the salary is better a little
But he too was depressed and they walked on toward their temporary lodging in a silence full of mutual grief
It was not until they had come within sight of this goal that he prefaced by a little sigh of resignation these further words Comelet us make the best of it my girl
After all we are in the hands of the Lord
Oh dont Theron
she said hastily
Dont talk to me about the Lord tonight I cant bear it
CHAPTER II Theron
Come out here
This is the funniest thing we have heard yet
Mrs Ware stood on the platform of her new kitchen stoop
The bright flood of Maymorning sunshine completely enveloped her girlish form clad in a simple freshstarched calico gown and shone in golden patches upon her lightbrown hair
She had a smile on her face as she looked down at the milk boy standing on the bottom stepa smile of a doubtful sort stormily mirthful
Come out a minute Theron
she called again and in obedience to the summons the tall lank figure of her husband appeared in the open doorway behind her
A long loose open dressinggown dangled to his knees and his sallow cleanshaven thoughtful face wore a morning undress expression of youthful goodnature
He leaned against the doorsill crossed his large carpet slippers and looked up into the sky drawing a long satisfied breath
What a beautiful morning
he exclaimed
The elms over there are full of robins
We must get up earlier these mornings and take some walks
His wife indicated the boy with the milkpail on his arm by a wave of her hand
Guess what he tells me
she said
It wasnt a mistake at all our getting no milk yesterday or the Sunday before
It seems that thats the custom here at least so far as the parsonage is concerned
Whats the matter boy
asked the young minister drawling his words a little and putting a sense of placid irony into them
Dont the cows give milk on Sunday then
The boy was not going to be chaffed
Oh Ill bring you milk fast enough on Sundays if you give me the word he said with nonchalance
Only it wont last long
How do you meanwont last long
 asked Mrs Ware briskly
The boy liked herboth for herself and for the doughnuts fried with her own hands which she gave him on his morning round
He dropped his halfdefiant tone
The thing of its this he explained
Every new minister starts in saying we can deliver to this house on Sundays an then gives us notice to stop before the months out
Its the trustees that does it
The Rev
Theron Ware uncrossed his feet and moved out on to the stoop beside his wife
Whats that you say
he interjected
Dont THEY take milk on Sundays
Nope
answered the boy
The young couple looked each other in the face for a puzzled moment then broke into a laugh
Well well try it anyway said the preacher
You can go on bringing it Sundays tilltill Till you cave in an tell me to stop put in the boy
All right
and he was off on the instant the dipper jangling loud incredulity in his pail as he went
The Wares exchanged another glance as he disappeared round the corner of the house and another mutual laugh seemed imminent
Then the wifes face clouded over and she thrust her underlip a trifle forward out of its place in the straight and gently firm profile
Its just what Wendell Phillips said she declared
The Puritans idea of hell is a place where everybody has to mind his own business
The young minister stroked his chin thoughtfully and let his gaze wander over the backyard in silence
The garden parts had not been spaded up but lay a useless stretch of muddy earth broken only by last years cabbagestumps and the general litter of dead roots and vegetation
The door of the tenantless chickencoop hung wide open
Before it was a great heap of ashes and cinders soaked into grimy hardness by the recent spring rains and nearer still an ancient choppingblock round which were scattered old weatherbeaten hardwood knots which had defied the axe parts of broken barrels and packingboxes and a nameless debris of tin cans clamshells and general rubbish
It was pleasanter to lift the eyes and look across the neighbors fences to the green waving tops of the elms on the street beyond
How lofty and beautiful they were in the morning sunlight and with what matchless charm came the song of the robins freshly installed in their haunts among the new palegreen leaves
Above them in the fresh scented air glowed the great blue dome radiant with light and the purification of spring
Theron lifted his thin longfingered hand and passed it in a slow arch of movement to comprehend this glorious upper picture
What matter anyones ideas of hell he said in soft grave tones when we have that to look at and listen to and fill our lungs with
It seems to me that we never FEEL quite so sure of Gods goodness at other times as we do in these wonderful new mornings of spring
The wife followed his gesture and her eyes rested for a brief moment with pleased interest upon the trees and the sky
Then they reverted with a harsher scrutiny to the immediate foreground
Those Van Sizers ought to be downright ashamed of themselves she said to leave everything in such a muss as this
You MUST see about getting a man to clean up the yard Theron
Its no use your thinking of doing it yourself
In the first place it wouldnt look quite the thing and second youd never get at it in all your born days
Or if a man would cost too much we might get a boy
I daresay Harvey would come around after hed finished with his milkroute in the forenoon
We could give him his dinner you know and Id bake him some cookies
Hes got the greatest sweettooth you ever heard of
And then perhaps if we gave him a quarter or say half a dollar hed be quite satisfied
Ill speak to him in the morning
We can save a dollar or so that way
I suppose every little does help commented Mr Ware with a doleful lack of conviction
Then his face brightened
I tell you what lets do
he exclaimed
Get on your street dress and well take a long walk way out into the country
Youve never seen the basin where they float the lografts in or the big sawmills
The hills beyond give you almost mountain effects they are so steep and they say theres a sulphur spring among the slate on the hillside somewhere with trees all about it and we could take some sandwiches with us You forget put in Mrs Warethose trustees are coming at eleven
So they are
assented the young minister with something like a sigh
He cast another reluctant lingering glance at the sunlit elm boughs and turning went indoors
He loitered for an aimless minute in the kitchen where his wife her sleeves rolled to the elbow now resumed the interrupted washing of the breakfast dishes perhaps with vague visions of that everreceding time to come when they might have a hired girl to do such work
Then he wandered off into the room beyond which served them alike as livingroom and study and let his eye run along the two rows of books that constituted his library
He saw nothing which he wanted to read
Finally he did take down Paleys Evidences and seated himself in the big armchairthat costly and oversized anomaly among his humble household gods but the book lay unopened on his knee and his eyelids half closed themselves in sign of revery
This was his third chargethis Octavius which they both knew they were going to dislike so much
The first had been in the pleasant dairy and hop country many miles to the south on another watershed and among a different kind of people
Perhaps in truth the grinding labor the poverty of ideas the systematic selfishness of later rural experience had not been lacking there but they played no part in the memories which now he passed in tender review
He recalled instead the warm sunshine on the fertile expanse of fields the sleek wellfed herds of milkers coming lowing down the road under the maples the prosperous and hospitable farmhouses with their orchards in blossom and their spacious red barns the bountiful boiled dinners which cheery housewives served up with their own skilled hands
Of course he admitted to himself it would not be the same if he were to go back there again
He was conscious of having moved alongwas it after all an advanceto a point where it was unpleasant to sit at table with the unfragrant hired man and still worse to encounter the bucolic confusion between the functions of knives and forks
But in those happy daysyoung zealous himself farmbred these trifles had been invisible to him and life there among those kindly husbandmen had seemed by contrast with the gaunt surroundings and gloomy rule of the theological seminary luxuriously abundant and free
It was there too that the crowning blessedness of his youthnay should he not say of all his days had come to him
There he had first seen Alice Hastings the brighteyed frankfaced serenely selfreliant girl who now less than four years thereafter could be heard washing the dishes out in the parsonage kitchen
How wonderful she had seemed to him then
How beautiful and allbeneficent the miracle still appeared
Though herself the daughter of a farmer her presence on a visit within the borders of his remote country charge had seemed to make everything there a hundred times more countrified than it had ever been before
She was fresh from the refinements of a town seminary she read books it was known that she could play upon the piano
Her clothes her manners her way of speaking the readiness of her thoughts and sprightly tongue not least perhaps the imposing current understanding as to her fathers wealthplaced her on a glorified pinnacle far away from the girls of the neighborhood
These honest and goodhearted creatures indeed called ceaseless attention to her superiority by their deference and openmouthed admiration and treated it as the most natural thing in the world that their young minister should be visibly taken with her
Theron Ware in truth left this first pastorate of his the following spring in a transfiguring halo of romance
His new appointment was to Tyrea somewhat distant village of traditional local pride and substanceand he was to be married only a day or so before entering upon his pastoral duties there
The good people among whom he had begun his ministry took kindly credit to themselves that he had met his bride while she was visiting round their countryside
In part by jocose inquiries addressed to the expectant groom in part by the confidences of the postmaster at the corners concerning the bulk and frequency of the correspondence passing between Theron and the now remote Alicethey had followed the progress of the courtship through the autumn and winter with friendly zest
When he returned from the Conference to say goodbye and confess the happiness that awaited him they gave him a donationquite as if he were a married pastor with a home of his own instead of a shy young bachelor who received his guests and their contributions in the house where he boarded
He went away with tears of mingled regret and proud joy in his eyes thinking a good deal upon their predictions of a distinguished career before him feeling infinitely strengthened and upborne by the hearty fervor of their Godspeed and taking with him nearly two wagonloads of vegetables apples canned preserves assorted furniture glass dishes cheeses pieced bedquilts honey feathers and kitchen utensils
Of the three years term in Tyre it was pleasantest to dwell upon the beginning
The young coupleafter being married out at Alices home in an adjoining county under the depressing conditions of a hopelessly bedridden mother and a father and brothers whose perceptions were obviously closed to the advantages of a matrimonial connection with Methodismcame straight to the house which their new congregation rented as a parsonage
The impulse of reaction from the rather grim cheerlessness of their wedding lent fresh gayety to their lighthearted whimsical start at housekeeping
They had never laughed so much in all their lives as they did now in these first monthsover their weird ignorance of domestic details with its mishaps mistakes and entertaining discoveries over the comical superabundances and shortcomings of their donation outfit over the thousand and one quaint experiences of their novel relation to each other to the congregation and to the world of Tyre at large
Theron indeed might be said never to have laughed before
Up to that time no friendly student of his character cataloguing his admirable qualities would have thought of including among them a sense of humor much less a bent toward levity
Neither his early strenuous battle to get away from the farm and achieve such education as should serve to open to him the gates of professional life nor the later wave of religious enthusiasm which caught him up as he stood on the borderland of manhood and swept him off into a veritable new world of views and aspirations had been a likely school of merriment
People had prized him for his innocent candor and guileless mind for his good heart his pious zeal his modesty about gifts notably above the average but it had occurred to none to suspect in him a latent funny side
But who could be solemn where Alice wasAlice in a quandary over the complications of her cooking stove Alice boiling her potatoes all day and her eggs for half an hour Alice ordering twenty pounds of steak and half a pound of sugar and striving to extract a breakfast beverage from the unground coffeebean
Clearly not so tenderly fond and sympathetic a husband as Theron
He began by laughing because she laughed and grew by swift stages to comprehend then frankly to share her amusement
From this it seemed only a step to the development of a humor of his own doubling as it were their sportive resources
He found himself discovering a new droll aspect in men and things his phraseology took on a dryly playful form fittingly to present conceits which danced up unabashed quite into the presence of lofty and majestic truths
He got from this nothing but satisfaction it obviously involved increased claims to popularity among his parishioners and consequently magnified powers of usefulness and it made life so much more a joy and a thing to be thankful for
Often in the midst of the exchange of merry quip and whimsical suggestion bright blossoms on that tree of strength and knowledge which he felt expanding now with a mighty outward pushing in all directions he would lapse into deep gravity and ponder with a swelling heart the vast unspeakable marvel of his blessedness in being thus enriched and humanized by daily communion with the most worshipful of womankind
This happy and good young couple took the affections of Tyre by storm
The Methodist Church there had at no time held its head very high among the denominations and for some years back had been in a deplorably sinking state owing first to the secession of the Free Methodists and then to the incumbency of a pastor who scandalized the community by marrying a black man to a white woman
But the Wares changed all this
Within a month the report of Therons charm and force in the pulpit was crowding the church building to its utmost capacityand that too with some of Tyres best people
Equally winning was the atmosphere of jollity and juvenile high spirits which pervaded the parsonage under these new conditions and which Theron and Alice seemed to diffuse wherever they went
Thus swimmingly their first year sped amid universal acclaim
Mrs Ware had a recognized social place quite outside the restricted limits of Methodism and shone in it with an unflagging brilliancy altogether beyond the traditions of Tyre
Delightful as she was in other peoples houses she was still more naively fascinating in her own quaint and somewhat harumscarum domicile and the drab twostoried tinroofed little parsonage might well have rattled its clapboards to see if it was not in dreamland so gay was the company so light were the hearts which it sheltered in these new days
As for Theron the period was one of incredible fructification and output
He scarcely recognized for his own the mind which now was reaching out on all sides with the arms of an octopus exploring unsuspected mines of thought bringing in rich treasures of deduction assimilating building propounding as if by some force quite independent of him
He could not look without blinking timidity at the radiance of the path stretched out before him leading upward to dazzling heights of greatness
At the end of this first year the Wares suddenly discovered that they were eight hundred dollars in debt
The second year was spent in arriving by slow stages and with a cruel wealth of pathetic detail at a realization of what being eight hundred dollars in debt meant
It was not in their elastic and buoyant natures to grasp the full significance of the thing at once or easily
Their position in the social structure too was all against clearsightedness in material matters
A general for example uniformed and in the saddle advancing through the streets with his staff in the proud wake of his divisions massed walls of bayonets cannot be imagined as quailing at the glance thrown at him by his tailor on the sidewalk
Similarly a man invested with sacerdotal authority who baptizes marries and buries who delivers judgments from the pulpit which may not be questioned in his hearing and who receives from all his fellowmen a special deference of manner and speech is in the nature of things prone to see the grocers book and the butchers bill through the little end of the telescope
The Wares at the outset had thought it right to trade as exclusively as possible with members of their own church society
This loyalty became a principal element of martyrdom
Theron had his creditors seated in serried rows before him Sunday after Sunday
Alice had her critics consolidated among those whom it was her chief duty to visit and profess friendship for
These situations now began by regular gradations to unfold their terrors
At the first intimation of discontent the Wares made what seemed to them a sweeping reduction in expenditure
When they heard that Brother Potter had spoken of them as poor pay they dismissed their hired girl
A little later Theron brought himself to drop a laboriously casual suggestion as to a possible increase of salary and saw with sinking spirits the faces of the stewards freeze with dumb disapprobation
Then Alice paid a visit to her parents only to find her brothers doggedly hostile to the notion of her being helped and her father so much under their influence that the paltry sum he dared offer barely covered the expenses of her journey
With another turn of the screw they sold the piano she had brought with her from home and cut themselves down to the bare necessities of life neither receiving company nor going out
They never laughed now and even smiles grew rare
By this time Therons sermons preached under that stony glare of people to whom he owed money had degenerated to a pitiful level of commonplace
As a consequence the attendance became once more confined to the insufficient membership of the church and the trustees complained of grievously diminished receipts
When the Wares grown desperate ventured upon the experiment of trading outside the bounds of the congregation the trustees complained again this time peremptorily
Thus the second year dragged itself miserably to an end
Nor was relief possible because the Presiding Elder knew something of the circumstances and felt it his duty to send Theron back for a third year to pay his debts and drain the cup of disciplinary medicine to its dregs
The worst has been told
Beginning in utter blackness this third year in the second month brought a change as welcome as it was unlooked for
An elderly and important citizen of Tyre by name Abram Beekman whom Theron knew slightly and had on occasions seen sitting in one of the back pews near the door called one morning at the parsonage and electrified its inhabitants by expressing a desire to wipe off all their old scores for them and give them a fresh start in life
As he put the suggestion they could find no excuse for rejecting it
He had watched them and heard a good deal about them and took a fatherly sort of interest in them
He did not deprecate their regarding the aid he proffered them in the nature of a loan but they were to make themselves perfectly easy about it and never return it at all unless they could spare it sometime with entire convenience and felt that they wanted to do so
As this amazing windfall finally took shape it enabled the Wares to live respectably through the year and to leave Tyre with something over one hundred dollars in hand
It enabled them too to revive in a chastened form their old dream of ultimate success and distinction for Theron
He had demonstrated clearly enough to himself during that brief season of unrestrained effulgence that he had within him the making of a great pulpit orator
He set to work now with resolute purpose to puzzle out and master all the principles which underlie this art and all the tricks that adorn its superstructure
He studied it fastened his thoughts upon it talked daily with Alice about it
In the pulpit addressing those people who had so darkened his life and crushed the first happiness out of his home he withheld himself from any oratorical display which could afford them gratification
He put aside as well the thought of attracting once more the nonMethodists of Tyre whose early enthusiasm had spread such pitfalls for his unwary feet
He practised effects now by piecemeal with an alert ear and calculation in every tone
An ambition at once embittered and tearfully solicitous possessed him
He reflected now this morning with a certain incredulous interest upon that unworthy epoch in his life history which seemed so far behind him and yet had come to a close only a few weeks ago
The opportunity had been given him there at the Tecumseh Conference to reveal his quality
He had risen to its full limit of possibilities and preached a great sermon in a manner which he at least knew was unapproachable
He had made his most powerful bid for the prize place had trebly deserved success and had been banished instead to Octavius
The curious thing was that he did not resent his failure
Alice had taken it hard but he himself was conscious of a sense of spiritual gain
The influence of the Conference with its songs and seasons of prayer and high pressure of emotional excitement was still strong upon him
It seemed years and years since the religious side of him had been so stirred into motion
He felt as he lay back in the chair and folded his hands over the book on his knee that he had indeed come forth from the fire purified and strengthened
The ministry to souls diseased beckoned him with a new and urgent significance
He smiled to remember that Mr Beekman speaking in his shrewd and pointed way had asked him whether looking it all over he didnt think it would be better for him to study law with a view to sliding out of the ministry when a good chance offered
It amazed him now to recall that he had taken this hint seriously and even gone to the length of finding out what books lawstudents began upon
Thank God
all that was past and gone now
The Call sounded resonant and imperative in his ears and there was no impulse of his heart no fibre of his being which did not stir in devout response
He closed his eyes to be the more wholly alone with the Spirit that moved him
The jangling of a bell in the hallway broke sharply upon his meditations and on the instant his wife thrust in her head from the kitchen
Youll have to go to the door Theron
she warned him in a loud swift whisper
Im not fit to be seen
It is the trustees
All right he said and rose slowly from sprawling recumbency to his feet
Ill go
And dont forget she added strenuously I believe in Levi Gorringe
Ive seen him go past here with his rod and fishbasket twice in eight days and thats a good sign
Hes got a soft side somewhere
And just keep a stiff upper lip about the gas and dont you let them jew you down a solitary cent on that sidewalk
All right said Theron again and moved reluctantly toward the hall door
CHAPTER III When the three trustees had been shown in by the Rev
Mr Ware and had taken seats an awkward little pause ensued
The young minister looked doubtingly from one face to another the while they glanced with inquiring interest about the room noting the pictures and appraising the furniture in their minds
The obvious leader of the party Loren Pierce a rich quarryman was an old man of medium size and mean attire with a square beardless face as hard and impassive in expression as one of his blocks of limestone
The irregular thinlipped mouth slightly sunken and shut with vicelike firmness the short snub nose and the little eyes squinting from halfclosed lids beneath slightly marked brows seemed scarcely to attain to the dignity of features but evaded attention instead as if feeling that they were only there at all from plain necessity and ought not to be taken into account
Mr Pierces face did not know how to smilewhat was the use of smilesbut its whole surface radiated secretiveness
Portrayed on canvas by a master brush with a ruff or a red robe for masquerade generations of imaginative amateurs would have seen in it vast reaching plots the skeletons of a dozen dynastic cupboards the guarded mysteries of half a centurys international diplomacy
The amateurs would have been wrong again
There was nothing behind Mr Pierces juiceless countenance more weighty than a general determination to exact seven per cent for his money and some specific notions about capturing certain brickyards which were interfering with his quarrysales
But Octavius watched him shamble along its sidewalks quite as the Vienna of dead and forgotten yesterday might have watched Metternich
Erastus Winch was of a breezier sorta florid stout and sandy man who spent most of his life driving over evil country roads in a buggy securing orders for dairy furniture and certain allied lines of farm utensils
This practice had given him a loud voice and a deceptively hearty manner to which the other avocation of cheesebuyer which he pursued at the Board of Trade meetings every Monday afternoon had added a considerable command of persuasive yet noncommittal language
To look at him still more to hear him one would have sworn he was a good fellow a trifle rough and noisy perhaps but all right at bottom
But the County Clerk of Dearborn County could have told you of agriculturists who knew Erastus from long and unhappy experience and who held him to be even a tighter man than Loren Pierce in the matter of a mortgage
The third trustee Levi Gorringe set one wondering at the very first glance what on earth he was doing in that company
Those who had known him longest had the least notion but it may be added that no one knew him well
He was a lawyer and had lived in Octavius for upwards of ten years that is to say since early manhood
He had an office on the main street just under the principal photograph gallery
Doubtless he was sometimes in this office but his fellowtownsmen saw him more often in the street doorway with the stairs behind him and the flaring showcases of the photographer on either side standing with his hands in his pockets and an unlighted cigar in his mouth looking at nothing in particular
About every other day he went off after breakfast into the country roundabout sometimes with a rod sometimes with a gun but always alone
He was a bachelor and slept in a room at the back of his office cooking some of his meals himself getting others at a restaurant close by
Though he had little visible practice he was understood to be welltodo and even more and people tacitly inferred that he shaved notes
The Methodists of Octavius looked upon him as a queer fish and through nearly a dozen years had never quite outgrown their hebdomadal tendency to surprise at seeing him enter their church
He had never it is true professed religion but they had elected him as a trustee now for a number of terms all the samepartly because he was their only lawyer partly because he like both his colleagues held a mortgage on the church edifice and lot
In person Mr Gorringe was a slender man with a skin of a clear uniform citron tint black waving hair and dark gray eyes and a thin highfeatured face
He wore a mustache and pointed chintuft and though he was of New England parentage and had never been further south than Ocean Grove he presented a general effect of old Mississippian traditions and tastes startlingly at variance with the standards of Dearborn County Methodism
Nothing could convince some of the elder sisters that he was not a drinking man
The three visitors had completed their survey of the room now and Loren Pierce emitted a dry harsh little cough as a signal that business was about to begin
At this sound Winch drew up his feet and Gorringe untied a parcel of accountbooks and papers that he held on his knee
Theron felt that his countenance must be exhibiting to the assembled brethren an unfortunate sense of helplessness in their hands
He tried to look more resolute and forced his lips into a smile
Brother Gorringe allus acts as Seckertary said Erastus Winch beaming broadly upon the minister as if the mere mention of the fact promoted jollity
Thats it Brother Gorringetake your seat at Brother Wares desk
Mind the Dominies pen dont play tricks on you an start off writin out sermons instid of figgers
The humorist turned to Theron as the lawyer walked over to the desk at the window
I allus have to caution him about that he remarked with great joviality
An do YOU look out afterwards Brother Ware or else youll catch that pen o yours scribblin lawyers lingo in place o the Word
Theron felt bound to exhibit a grin in acknowledgment of this pleasantry
The lawyers change of position had involved some shifting of the others chairs and the young minister found himself directly confronted by Brother Pierces hard and colorless old visage
Its little eyes were watching him as through a mask and under their influence the smile of politeness fled from his lips
The lawyer on his right the cheesebuyer to the left seemed to recede into distance as he for the moment returned the gaze of the quarryman
He waited now for him to speak as if the others were of no importance
We are a plain sort o folks up in these parts said Brother Pierce after a slight further pause
His voice was as dry and rasping as his cough and its intonations were those of authority
We walk here he went on eying the minister with a sour regard in a meek an humble spirit in the straight an narrow way which leadeth unto life
We aint gone traipsin after strange gods like some people that call themselves Methodists in other places
We stick by the Discipline an the ways of our fathers in Israel
No newfangled notions can go down here
Your wifed better take them flowers out of her bunnit afore next Sunday
Silence possessed the room for a few moments the while Theron palefaced and with brows knit studied the pattern of the ingrain carpet
Then he lifted his head and nodded it in assent
Yes he said we will do nothing by which our brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak
Brother Pierces parchment face showed no sign of surprise or pleasure at this easy submission
Another thing We dont want no booklearnin or dictionary words in our pulpit he went on coldly
Some folks may stomach em we wont
Them two sermons o yours praps theyd do down in some city place but theyre like your wifes bunnit here theyre too flowery to suit us
What we want to hear is the plain oldfashioned Word of God without any palaver or hems and has
They tell me theres some parts where hells treated as playedout where our ministers dont like to talk much about it because people dont want to hear about it
Such preachers ought to be put out
They aint Methodists at all
What we want here sir is straightout flatfooted hell the burnin lake o fire an brimstone
Pour it into em hot an strong
We cant have too much of it
Work in them awful deathbeds of Voltaire an Tom Paine with the Devil right there in the room reachin for em an they yellin for fright thats what fills the anxious seat an brings in souls hand over fist
Therons tongue dallied for an instant with the temptation to comment upon these oldwife fables which were so dear to the rural religious heart when he and I were boys
But it seemed wiser to only nod again and let his mentor go on
We aint had no trouble with the Free Methodists here continued Brother Pierce jest because we kept to the old paths an seek for salvation in the good old way
Everybody can shout Amen
as loud and as long as the Spirit moves him with us
Some one was sayin you thought we ought to have a choir and an organ
No sirree
No such tomfoolery for us
Youll only stir up feelin agin yourself by hintin at such things
And then too our folks dont take no stock in all that pack o nonsense about science such as tellin the age of the earth by crackin up stones
Ive ben in the quarry line all my life an I know its all humbug
Why they say some folks are goin round now preachin that our grandfathers were all monkeys
That comes from departin from the ways of our forefathers an puttin in organs an choirs an deckin our womenfolks out with gewgaws an apin the fashions of the worldly
I shouldnt wonder if them kind did have some monkey blood in em
Youll find were a different sort here
The young minister preserved silence for a little until it became apparent that the old trustee had had his say out
Even then he raised his head slowly and at last made answer in a hesitating and irresolute way You have been very frank he said
I am obliged to you
A clergyman coming to a new charge cannot be better served than by having laid before him a clear statement of the views andand spiritual tendenciesof his new flock quite at the outset
I feel it to be of especial value in this case because I am young in years and in my ministry and am conscious of a great weakness of the flesh
I can see how daily contact with a people so attached to the old simple primitive Methodism of Wesley and Asbury may be a source of much strength to me
I may take it he added upon second thought with an inquiring glance at Mr Winch that Brother Pierces description of our charge and its tastes and needs meets with your approval
Erastus Winch nodded his head and smiled expansively
Whatever Brother Pierce says goes
he declared
The lawyer sitting behind at the desk by the window said nothing
The place is jest overrun with Irish Brother Pierce began again
Theyve got two Catholic churches here now to our one and they do jest as they blamed please at the Charter elections
Itd be a good idee to pitch into Catholics in general whenever you can
You could make a hit that way
I say the State ought to make em pay taxes on their church property
Theyve no right to be exempted because they aint Christians at all
Theyre idolaters thats what they are
I know em
Ive had em in my quarries for years an they aint got no idee of decency or fair dealin
Every time the price of stone went up every man of em would jine to screw more wages out o me
Why they used to keep account o the amount o business I done an figger up my profits an have the face to come an talk to me about em as if that had anything to do with wages
Its my belief their priests put em up to it
People dont begin to reelize that church of idolatry ll be the ruin o this country if it aint checked in time
Jest you go at em hammer n tongs
Ive got Eyetalians in the quarries now
Theyre sensible fellows they know when theyre well off a dollar a day an theyre satisfied an everything goes smooth
But theyre Catholics the same as the Irish suddenly interjected the lawyer from his place by the window
Theron pricked up his ears at the sound of his voice
There was an antiPierce note in it so to speak which it did him good to hear
The consciousness of sympathy began on the instant to inspire him with courage
I know some people SAY they are Brother Pierce guardedly retorted but Ive summered an wintered both kinds an I hold to it theyre different
I grant ye the Eyetalians ARE some given to jabbin knives into each other but they never git up strikes an they dont grumble about wages
Why look at the way they live jest some weeds an yarbs dug up on the roadside an stewed in a kettle with a piece o fat the size o your finger an a loaf o bread an theyre happy as a king
Theres some sense in THAT but the Irish theyve got to have meat an potatoes an butter jest as ifas if As if theyd ben used to em at home put in Mr Winch to help his colleague out
The lawyer ostentatiously drew up his chair to the desk and began turning over the leaves of his biggest book
Its getting on toward noon gentlemen he said in an impatient voice
The business meeting which followed was for a considerable time confined to hearing extracts from the books and papers read in a swift and formal fashion by Mr Gorringe
If this was intended to inform the new pastor of the exact financial situation in Octavius it lamentably failed of its purpose
Theron had little knowledge of figures and though he tried hard to listen and to assume an air of comprehension he did not understand much of what he heard
In a general way he gathered that the church property was put down at 12000 on which there was a debt of 4800
The annual expenses were 2250 of which the principal items were 800 for his salary 170 for the rent of the parsonage and 319 for interest on the debt
It seemed that last year the receipts had fallen just under 2000 and they now confronted the necessity of making good this deficit during the coming year as well as increasing the regular revenues
Without much discussion it was agreed that they should endeavor to secure the services of a celebrated debtraiser early in the autumn and utilize him in the closing days of a revival
Theron knew this debtraiser and had seen him at work a burly bustling vulgar man who took possession of the pulpit as if it were an auctioneers block and pursued the task of exciting liberality in the bosoms of the congregation by alternating prayer anecdote song and cheap buffoonery in a manner truly sickening
Would it not be preferable he feebly suggested to raise the money by a festival or fair or some other form of entertainment which the ladies could manage
Brother Pierce shook his head with contemptuous emphasis
Our womenfolks aint that kind he said
They did try to hold a sociable once but nobody came and we didnt raise more n three or four dollars
It aint their line
They lack the worldly arts
As the Discipline commands they avoid the evil of putting on gold and costly apparel and taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the Lord Jesus
Wellof courseif you prefer the debtraiser Theron began and took the itemized account from Gorringes knee as an excuse for not finishing the hateful sentence
He looked down the foolscap sheet line by line with no special sense of what it signified until his eye caught upon this little section of the report bracketed by itself in the Secretarys neat hand INTEREST CHARGE
First mortgage 1873  1000  E Winch 7  70 Second mortgage 1776 1700  L Gorringe 6 102 Third mortgage 1878 2100  L Pierce 7 147   4800 319 It was no news to him that the three mortgages on the church property were held by the three trustees
But as he looked once more another feature of the thing struck him as curious
I notice that the rates of interest vary he remarked without thinking and then wished the words unsaid for the two trustees in view moved uneasily on their seats
Oh thats nothing exclaimed Erastus Winch with a boisterous display of jollity
Its only Brother Gorringes pleasant little way of making a contribution to our funds
You will notice that at the date of all these mortgages the State rate of interest was seven per cent
Since then its ben lowered to six
Well when that happened you see Brother Gorringe not being a professin member and so not bound by our rules he could just as well as not let his interest down a cent
But Brother Pierce an me we talked it over an we made up our minds we were tied hand an foot by our contract
You know how strong the Discipline lays it down that we must be bound to the letter of our agreements
That bein so we seen it in the light of duty not to change what wed set our hands to
Thats how it is Brother Ware
I understand said Theron with an effort at polite calmness of tone
Andis there anything else
Theres this broke in Brother Pierce were commanded to be lawabiding people an seven per cent WAS the law an would be now if them ragamuffins in the Legislation Surely we neednt go further into that interrupted the minister conscious of a growing stiffness in his moral spine
Have we any other business before us
Brother Pierces little eyes snapped and the wrinkles in his forehead deepened angrily
Business
he demanded
Yes plenty of it
Weve got to reduce expenses
Were nigh onto 300 behindhand this minute
Besides your houserent you get 800 free an clearthat is 1538 every week an only you an your wife to keep out of it
Why when I was your age young man and after that too I was glad to get 4 a week
I dont think my salary is under discussion Mr Pierce BROTHER Pierce
suggested Winch in a halfshuckling undertone
Brother Pierce then
echoed Theron impatiently
The Quarterly Conference and the Estimating Committee deal with that
The trustees have no more to do with it than the man in the moon
Come come Brother Ware put in Erastus Winch we mustnt have no hard feelins
Brotherly love is what were all lookin after
Brother Pierces meanin wasnt agin your drawin your full salary every cent of it onlyonly there are certain little things connected with the parsonage here that we feel you ought to bear
Fr instance theres the new sidewalk we had to lay in front of the house here only a month ago
Of course if the treasury was flush we wouldnt say a word about it
An then theres the gas bill here
Seein as you get your rent for nothin it dont seem much to ask that you should see to lightin the place yourself
No I dont think that either is a proper charge upon me interposed Theron
I decline to pay them
We can have the gas shut off remarked Brother Pierce coldly
As soon as you like responded the minister sitting erect and tapping the carpet nervously with his foot
Only you must understand that I will take the whole matter to the Quarterly Conference in July
I already see a good many other interesting questions about the financial management of this church which might be appropriately discussed there
Oh come Brother Ware
broke in Trustee Winch with a somewhat agitated assumption of goodfeeling
Surely these are matters we ought to settle amongst ourselves
We never yet asked outsiders to meddle with our business here
Its our motto Brother Ware
I say if youve got a motto stand by it
Well my motto said Theron is to be behaved decently to by those with whom I have to deal and I also propose to stand by it
Brother Pierce rose gingerly to his feet with the hesitation of an old man not sure about his knees
When he had straightened himself he put on his hat and eyed the minister sternly from beneath its brim
The Lord gives us crosses grievous to our natur he said an were told to bear em cheerfully as long as theyre on our backs but there aint nothin said agin our unloadin em in the ditch the minute we git the chance
I guess you wont last here more n a twelvemonth
He pulled his soft and discolored old hat down over his brows with a significantly hostile nod and turning stumped toward the halldoor without offering to shake hands
The other trustees had risen likewise in tacit recognition that the meeting was over
Winch clasped the ministers hand in his own broad hard palm and squeezed it in an exuberant grip
Dont mind his little ways Brother Ware he urged in a loud unctuous whisper with a grinning backward nod hes a trifle skittish sometimes when you dont give him free rein but hes all wool an a yard wide when it comes to rightdown hardpan religion
My love to Sister Ware and he followed the senior trustee into the hall
Mr Gorringe had been tying up his books and papers
He came now with the bulky parcel under his arm and his hat and stick in the other hand
He could give little but his thumb to Theron to shake
His face wore a grave expression and not a line relaxed as catching the ministers look he slowly covered his left eye in a deliberate wink
Welland how did it go off
asked Alice from where she knelt by the oven door a few minutes later
For answer Theron threw himself wearily into the big old farm rockingchair on the other side of the stove and shook his head with a lengthened sigh
If it wasnt for that man Gorringe of yours he said dejectedly I think I should feel like going off and learning a trade
Chapter IV On the following Sunday young Mrs Ware sat alone in the preachers pew through the morning service and everybody noted that the roses had been taken from her bonnet
In the evening she was absent and after the doxology and benediction several people under the pretence of solicitude for her health tried to pump her husband as to the reason
He answered their inquiries civilly enough but with brevity she had stayed at home because she did not feel like coming outthis and nothing more
The congregation dispersed under a gossipladen cloud of consciousness that there must be something queer about Sister Ware
There was a tolerably general agreement however that the two sermons of the day had been excellent
Not even Loren Pierces railing commentary on the pastors introduction of an outlandish word like epitomeclearly forbidden by the Disciplines injunction to plain language understood of the people availed to sap the satisfaction of the majority
Theron himself comprehended that he had pleased the bulk of his auditors the knowledge left him curiously hot and cold
On the one hand there was joy in the apparent prospect that the congregation would back him up in a stand against the trustees if worst came to worst
But on the other hand the bonnet episode entered his soul
It had been a source of bitter humiliation to him to see his wife sitting there beneath the pulpit shorn by despotic order of the adornments natural to her pretty head
But he had even greater pain in contemplating the effect it had produced on Alice herself
She had said not a word on the subject but her every glance and gesture seemed to him eloquent of deep feeling about it
He made sure that she blamed him for having defended his own gas and sidewalk rights with successful vigor but permitted the sacrifice of her poor little inoffensive roses without a protest
In this view of the matter indeed he blamed himself
Was it too late to make the error good
He ventured a hint on this Sunday evening when he returned to the parsonage and found her reading an old weekly newspaper by the light of the kitchen lamp to the effect that he fancied there would be no great danger in putting those roses back into her bonnet
Without lifting her eyes from the paper she answered that she had no earthly desire to wear roses in her bonnet and went on with her reading
At breakfast the next morning Theron found himself in command of an unusual fund of humorous good spirits and was at pains to make the most of it passing whimsical comments on subjects which the opening day suggested recalling quaint and comical memories of the past and striving his best to force Alice into a laugh
Formerly her merry temper had always ignited at the merest spark of gayety
Now she gave his jokes only a dutiful halfsmile and uttered scarcely a word in response to his running fire of talk
When the meal was finished she went silently to work to clear away the dishes
Theron turned over in his mind the project of offering to help her as he had done so often in those dear old days when they laughingly began life together
Something decided this project in the negative for him and after lingering moments he put on his hat and went out for a walk
Not even the most doleful and trying hour of his bitter experience in Tyre had depressed him like this
Looking back upon these past troubles he persuaded himself that he had borne them all with a light and cheerful heart simply because Alice had been one with him in every thought and emotion
How perfect how ideally complete their sympathy had always been
With what absolute unity of mind and soul they had trod that difficult path together
And nowhenceforthwas it to be different
The mere suggestion of such a thing chilled his veins
He said aloud to himself as he walked that life would be an intolerable curse if Alice were to cease sharing it with him in every conceivable phase
He had made his way out of town and tramped along the country hillroad for a considerable distance before a merciful light began to lessen the shadows in the picture of gloom with which his mind tortured itself
All at once he stopped short lifted his head and looked about him
The broad valley lay warm and tranquil in the May sunshine at his feet
In the thicket up the sidehill above him a gray squirrel was chattering shrilly and the birds sang in a tireless choral confusion
Theron smiled and drew a long breath
The gay clamor of the woodland songsters the placid radiance of the landscape were suddenly taken in and made a part of his new mood
He listened smiled once more and then started in a leisurely way back toward Octavius
How could he have been so ridiculous as to fancy that Alice his Alicehad been changed into someone else
He marvelled now at his own perverse folly
She was overworked tired outthat was all
The task of moving in of setting the new household to rights had been too much for her
She must have a rest
They must get in a hired girl
Once this decision about a servant fixed itself in the young ministers mind it drove out the last vestage of discomfort
He strode along now in great content revolving idly a dozen different plans for gilding and beautifying this new life of leisure into which his sanguine thoughts projected Alice
One of these particularly pleased him and waxed in definiteness as he turned it over and over
He would get another piano for her in place of that which had been sacrificed in Tyre
That beneficient modern invention the instalment plan made this quite feasibleso easy in fact that it almost seemed as if he should find his wife playing on the new instrument when he got home
He would stop in at the music store and see about it that very day
Of course now that these important resolutions had been taken it would be a good thing if he could do something to bring in some extra money
This was by no means a new notion
He had mused over the possibility in a formless way ever since that memorable discovery of indebtedness in Tyre and had long ago recognized the hopelessness of endeavor in every channel save that of literature
Latterly his fancy had been stimulated by reading an account of the profits which Canon Farrar had derived from his Life of Christ
If such a book could command such a bewildering multitude of readers Theron felt there ought to be a chance for him
So clear did constant rumination render this assumption that the young pastor in time had come to regard this prospective book of his as a substantial asset which could be realized without trouble whenever he got around to it
He had not it is true gone to the length of seriously considering what should be the subject of his book
That had not seemed to him to matter much so long as it was scriptural
Familiarity with the process of extracting a fixed amount of spiritual and intellectual meat from any casual text week after week had given him an idea that any one of many subjects would do when the time came for him to make a choice
He realized now that the time for a selection had arrived and almost simultaneously found himself with a readymade decision in his mind
The book should be about Abraham
Theron Ware was extremely interested in the mechanism of his own brain and followed its workings with a lively curiosity
Nothing could be more remarkable he thought than to thus discover that on the instant of his formulating a desire to know what he should write upon lo and behold
there his mind quite on its own initiative had the answer waiting for him
When he had gone a little further and the powerful range of possibilities in the sons revolt against the idolatry of his father the imagemaker in the exodus from the unholy city of Ur and in the influence of the new nomadic life upon the little deistic family group had begun to unfold itself before him he felt that the hand of Providence was plainly discernible in the matter
The book was to be blessed from its very inception
Walking homeward briskly now with his eyes on the sidewalk and his mind all aglow with crowding suggestions for the new work and impatience to be at it he came abruptly upon a group of men and boys who occupied the whole path and were moving forward so noiselessly that he had not heard them coming
He almost ran into the leader of this little procession and began a stammering apology the final words of which were left unspoken so solemnly heedless of him and his talk were all the faces he saw
In the centre of the group were four workingmen bearing between them an extemporized litter of two poles and a blanket hastily secured across them with spikes
Most of what this litter held was covered by another blanket rounded in coarse folds over a shapeless bulk
From beneath its farther end protruded a big broomlike black beard thrown upward at such an angle as to hide everything beyond to those in front
The tall young minister stepping aside and standing tiptoe could see sloping downward behind this hedge of beard a pinched and chalklike face with wideopen staring eyes
Its lips of a dull lilac hue were moving ceaselessly and made a dry clicking sound
Theron instinctively joined himself to those who followed the littera motley dozen of street idlers chiefly boys
One of these in whispers explained to him that the man was one of Jerry Maddens workmen in the wagonshops who had been deployed to trim an elmtree in front of his employers house and being unused to such work had fallen from the top and broken all his bones
They would have cared for him at Maddens house but he had insisted upon being taken home
His name was MacEvoy and he was Joey MacEvoys father and likewise Jims and Hugheys and Martins
After a pause the lad a brighteyed freckled barefooted wee Irishman volunteered the further information that his big brother had run to bring Father Forbess on the chance that he might be in time to administer extry munction
The way of the silent little procession led through back streetswhere women hanging up clothes in the yards hurried to the gates their aprons full of clothespins to stare openmouthed at the passersby and came to a halt at last in an irregular and muddy lane before one of a half dozen shanties reared among the ashheaps and debris of the towns most bedraggled outskirts
A stout middleaged redarmed woman already warned by some messenger of calamity stood waiting on the roadside bank
There were whimpering children clinging to her skirts and a surrounding cluster of women of the neighborhood some of the more elderly of whom shrivelled little crones in tidy caps and with their aprons to their eyes were beginning in a lowmurmured minor the wail which presently should rise into the keen of death
Mrs MacEvoy herself made no moan and her broad ruddy face was stern in expression rather than sorrowful
When the litter stopped beside her she laid a hand for an instant on her husbands wet brow and looked one could have sworn impassivelyinto his staring eyes
Then still without a word she waved the bearers toward the door and led the way herself
Theron somewhat wonderingly found himself a minute later inside a dark and illsmelling room the air of which was humid with the steam from a boiler of clothes on the stove and not in other ways improved by the presence of a jostling score of women all straining their gaze upon the open door of the only other apartmentthe bedchamber
Through this they could see the workmen laying MacEvoy on the bed and standing awkwardly about thereafter getting in the way of the wife and old Maggie Quirk as they strove to remove the garments from his crushed limbs
As the neighbors watched what could be seen of these proceedings they whispered among themselves eulogies of the injured mans industry and good temper his habit of bringing his money home to his wife and the way he kept his Father Mathew pledge and attended to his religious duties
They admitted freely that by the light of his example their own husbands and sons left much to be desired and from this wandered easily off into domestic digressions of their own
But all the while their eyes were bent upon the bedroom door and Theron made out after he had grown accustomed to the gloom and the smell that many of them were telling their beads even while they kept the muttered conversation alive
None of them paid any attention to him or seemed to regard his presence there as unusual
Presently he saw enter through the sunlit street doorway a person of a different class
The bright light shone for a passing instant upon a fashionable flowered hat and upon some remarkably brilliant shade of red hair beneath it
In another moment there had edged along through the throng to almost within touch of him a tall young woman the owner of this hat and wonderful hair
She was clad in light and pleasing spring attire and carried a parasol with a long oxidized silver handle of a quaint pattern
She looked at him and he saw that her face was of a lengthened oval with a luminous rosetinted skin full red lips and big brown frank eyes with heavy auburn lashes
She made a grave little inclination of her head toward him and he bowed in response
Since her arrival he noted the chattering of the others had entirely ceased
I followed the others in in the hope that I might be of some assistance he ventured to explain to her in a low murmur feeling that at last here was some one to whom an explanation of his presence in this Romish house was due
I hope they wont feel that I have intruded
She nodded her head as if she quite understood
Theyll take the will for the deed she whispered back
Father Forbes will be here in a minute
Do you know is it too late
Even as she spoke the outer doorway was darkened by the commanding bulk of a newcomers figure
The flash of a silk hat and the deferential way in which the assembled neighbors fell back to clear a passage made his identity clear
Theron felt his blood tingle in an unaccustomed way as this priest of a strange church advanced across the room a broadshouldered portly man of more than middle height with a shapely stronglined face of almost waxen pallor and a firm commanding tread
He carried in his hands besides his hat a small leatherbound case
To this and to him the women courtesied and bowed their heads as he passed
Come with me whispered the tall girl with the parasol to Theron and he found himself pushing along in her wake until they intercepted the priest just outside the bedroom door
She touched Father Forbes on the arm
Just to tell you that I am here she said
The priest nodded with a grave face and passed into the other room
In a minute or two the workmen Mrs MacEvoy and her helper came out and the door was shut behind them
He is making his confession explained the young lady
Stay here for a minute
She moved over to where the woman of the house stood glumfaced and tearless and whispered something to her
A confused movement among the crowd followed and out of it presently resulted a small table covered with a white cloth and bearing on it two unlighted candles a basin of water and a spoon which was brought forward and placed in readiness before the closed door
Some of those nearest this cleared space were kneeling now and murmuring a low buzz of prayer to the click of beads on their rosaries
The door opened and Theron saw the priest standing in the doorway with an uplifted hand
He wore now a surplice with a purple band over his shoulders and on his pale face there shone a tranquil and tender light
One of the workmen fetched from the stove a brand lighted the two candles and bore the table with its contents into the bedroom
The young woman plucked Therons sleeve and he dumbly followed her into the chamber of death making one of the group of a dozen headed by Mrs MacEvoy and her children which filled the little room and overflowed now outward to the street door
He found himself bowing with the others to receive the sprinkled holy water from the priests white fingers kneeling with the others for the prayers following in impressed silence with the others the strange ceremonial by which the priest traced crosses of holy oil with his thumb upon the eyes ears nostrils lips hands and feet of the dying man wiping off the oil with a piece of cottonbatting each time after he had repeated the invocation to forgiveness for that particular sense
But most of all he was moved by the rich novel sound of the Latin as the priest rolled it forth in the ASPERGES ME DOMINE and MISEREATUR VESTRI OMNIPOTENS DEUS with its soft Continental vowels and liquid Rs
It seemed to him that he had never really heard Latin before
Then the astonishing young woman with the red hair declaimed the CONFITEOR vigorously and with a resonant distinctness of enunciation
It was a different Latin harsher and more sonorous and while it still dominated the murmured undertone of the others prayers the last moment came
Theron had stood face to face with death at many other bedsides no other final scene had stirred him like this
It must have been the girls Latin chant with its clanging reiteration of the great namesBEATUM MICHAELEM ARCHANGELUM BEATUM JOANNEM BAPTISTAM SANCTOS APOSTOLOS PETRUM ET PAULUMinvoked with such proud confidence in this squalid little shanty which so strangely affected him
He came out with the others at lastthe candles and the folded hands over the crucifix left behindand walked as one in a dream
Even by the time that he had gained the outer doorway and stood blinking at the bright light and filling his lungs with honest air once more it had begun to seem incredible to him that he had seen and done all this
CHAPTER V While Mr Ware stood thus on the doorstep through a minute of formless musing the priest and the girl came out and somewhat to his confusion made him one of their party
He felt himself flushing under the idea that they would think he had waited for themwas thrusting himself upon them
The notion prompted him to bow frigidly in response to Father Forbes pleasant I am glad to meet you sir and his outstretched hand
I dropped in by thethe merest accident Theron said
I met them bringing the poor man home andand quite without thinking I obeyed the impulse to follow them in and didnt realize He stopped short annoyed by the reflection that this was his second apology
The girl smiled placidly at him the while she put up her parasol
It did me good to see you there she said quite as if she had known him all her life
And so it did the rest of us
Father Forbes permitted himself a soft little chuckle approving rather than mirthful and patted her on the shoulder with the air of being fifty years her senior instead of fifteen
To the ministers relief he changed the subject as the three started together toward the road
Then again no doctor was sent for
he exclaimed as if resuming a familiar subject with the girl
Then he turned to Theron
I daresay you have no such trouble but with our poorer people it is very vexing
They will not call in a physician but hurry off first for the clergyman
I dont know that it is altogether to avoid doctors bills but it amounts to that in effect
Of course in this case it made no difference but I have had to make it a rule not to go out at night unless they bring me a physicians card with his assurance that it is a genuine affair
Why only last winter I was routed up after midnight and brought off in the mud and pelting rain up one of the new streets on the hillside there simply because a factory girl who was laced too tight had fainted at a dance
I slipped and fell into a puddle in the darkness ruined a new overcoat and got drenched to the skin and when I arrived the girl had recovered and was dancing away again thirteen to the dozen
It was then that I made the rule
I hope Mr Ware that Octavius is producing a pleasant impression upon you so far
I scarcely know yet answered Theron
The genial talk of the priest with its whimsical anecdote had in truth passed over his head
His mind still had room for nothing but that novel deathbed scene with the winged captain of the angelic host the Baptist the glorified Fisherman
and the Preacher all being summoned down in the pomp of liturgical Latin to help MacEvoy to die
If you dont mind my saying so he added hesitatingly what I have just seen in there DID make a very powerful impression upon me
It is a very ancient ceremony said the priest probably Persian like the baptismal form although for that matter we can never dig deep enough for the roots of these things
They all turn up Turanian if we probe far enough
Our ways separate here Im afraid
I am delighted to have made your acquaintance Mr Ware
Pray look in upon me if you can as well as not
We are near neighbors you know
Father Forbes had shaken hands and moved off up another street some distance before the voice of the girl recalled Theron to himself
Of course you knew HIM by name she was saying and he knew you by sight and had talked of you but MY poor inferior sex has to be introduced
I am Celia Madden
My father has the wagonshops and II play the organ at the church
II am delighted to make your acquaintance said Theron conscious as he spoke that he had slavishly echoed the formula of the priest
He could think of nothing better to add than Unfortunately we have no organ in our church
The girl laughed as they resumed their walk down the street
Im afraid I couldnt undertake two she said and laughed again
Then she spoke more seriously
That ceremony must have interested you a good deal never having seen it before
I saw that it was all new to you and so I made bold to take you under my wing so to speak
You were very kind said the young minister
It was really a great experience for me
Maymay I ask is it a part of your functions in the church I mean to attend these last rites
Mercy no
replied the girl spinning the parasol on her shoulder and smiling at the thought
No it was only because MacEvoy was one of our workmen and really came by his death through father sending him up to trim a tree
Ann MacEvoy will never forgive us that the longest day she lives
Did you notice her
She wouldnt speak to me
After you came out I tried to tell her that we would look out for her and the children but all she would say to me was An fwat would a wheelwright an him the father of a family be doin up a tree
They had come now upon the main street of the village with its flagstone sidewalk overhung by a lofty canopy of elmboughs
Here for the space of a block was concentrated such fashionable elegance of mansions and ornamental lawns as Octavius had to offer and it was presented with the irregularity so characteristic of our restless civilization
Two or three of the houses survived untouched from the earlier daysprim decorous structures each with its gabled centre and lower wings each with its row of fluted columns supporting the classical roof of a piazza across its whole front each vying with the others in the whiteness of those wooden walls enveloping its bright green blinds
One had to look over picket fences to see these houses and in doing so caught the notion that they thus railed themselves off in pride at being able to remember before the railroad came to the village or the wagonworks were thought of
Before the neighboring properties the fences had been swept away so that one might stroll from the sidewalk straight across the welltrimmed sward to any one of a dozen elaborately modern doorways
Some of the residences thus frankly proffering friendship to the passerby were of wood painted in drabs and dusky reds with bulging windows which marked the native yearning for the mediaeval and shingles that strove to be accounted tiles
Othersa prouder less pretentious sort were of brick or stone with terracotta mouldings set into the walls and with real slates covering the riot of turrets and peaks and dormer peepholes overhead
Celia Madden stopped in front of the largest and most importantlooking of these new edifices and said holding out her hand Here I am once more
Goodmorning Mr
Ware
Theron hoped that his manner did not betray the flash of surprise he felt in discovering that his new acquaintance lived in the biggest house in Octavius
He remembered now that some one had pointed it out as the abode of the owner of the wagon factories but it had not occurred to him before to associate this girl with that village magnate
It was stupid of him of course because she had herself mentioned her father
He looked at her again with an awkward smile as he formally shook the gloved hand she gave him and lifted his soft hat
The strong noon sunlight forcing its way down between the elms and beating upon her parasol of laceedged creamy silk made a halo about her hair and face at once brilliant and tender
He had not seen before how beautiful she was
She nodded in recognition of his salute and moved up the lawn walk spinning the sunshade on her shoulder
Though the parsonage was only three blocks away the young minister had time to think about a good many things before he reached home
First of all he had to revise in part the arrangement of his notions about the Irish
Save for an occasional isolated and taciturn figure among the nomadic portion of the hired help in the farm country Theron had scarcely ever spoken to a person of this curiously alien race before
He remembered now that there had been some dozen or more Irish families in Tyre quartered in the outskirts among the brickyards but he had never come in contact with any of them or given to their existence even a passing thought
So far as personal acquaintance went the Irish had been to him only a name
But what a sinister and repellent name
His views on this general subject were merely those common to his communion and his environment
He took it for granted for example that in the large cities most of the poverty and all the drunkenness crime and political corruption were due to the perverse qualities of this foreign people qualities accentuated and emphasized in every evil direction by the baleful influence of a false and idolatrous religion
It is hardly too much to say that he had never encountered a dissenting opinion on this point
His boyhood had been spent in those bitter days when social political and blood prejudices were fused at white heat in the public crucible together
When he went to the Church Seminary it was a matter of course that every member of the faculty was a Republican and that every one of his classmates had come from a Republican household
When later on he entered the ministry the rule was still incredulous of exceptions
One might as well have looked in the Nedahma Conference for a divergence of opinion on the Trinity as for a difference in political conviction
Indeed even among the laity Theron could not feel sure that he had ever known a Democrat that is at all closely
He understood very little about politics it is true
If he had been driven into a corner and forced to attempt an explanation of this tremendous partisan unity in which he had a share he would probably have first mentioned the War the last shots of which were fired while he was still in petticoats
Certainly his second reason however would have been that the Irish were on the other side
He had never before had occasion to formulate even in his own thoughts this tacit race and religious aversion in which he had been bred
It rose now suddenly in front of him as he sauntered from patch to patch of sunlight under the elms like some huge shadowy and symbolic monument
He looked at it with wondering curiosity as at something he had heard of all his life but never seen before an abhorrent spectacle truly
The foundations upon which its dark bulk reared itself were ignorance squalor brutality and vice
Pigs wallowed in the mire before its base and burrowing into this base were a myriad of narrow doors each bearing the hateful sign of a saloon and giving forth from its recesses of night the sounds of screams and curses
Above were sculptured rows of lowering apelike faces from Nasts and Kepplers cartoons and out of these sprang into the vague upper gloomon the one side lampposts from which negroes hung by the neck and on the other gibbets for dynamiters and Molly Maguires and between the two glowed a spectral picture of some blackrobed tonsured men with leering satanic masks making a bonfire of the Bible in the public schools
Theron stared this phantasm hard in the face and recognized it for a very tolerable embodiment of what he had heretofore supposed he thought about the Irish
For an instant the sight of it made him shiver as if the sunny May had of a sudden lapsed back into bleak December
Then he smiled and the bad vision went off into space
He saw instead Father Forbes in the white and purple vestments standing by poor MacEvoys bedside with his pale chiselled luminous uplifted face and he heard only the proud confident clanging of the girls recital BEATUM MICHAELEM ARCHANGELUM BEATUM JOANNEM BAPTISTAM PETRUM ET PAULUMEMAMUMlike strokes on a great resonant alarmbell attuned for the hearing of heaven
He caught himself on the very verge of feeling that heaven must have heard
Then he smiled again and laid the matter aside with a parting admission that it had been undoubtedly picturesque and impressive and that it had been a valuable experience to him to see it
At least the Irish with all their faults must have a poetic strain or they would not have clung so tenaciously to those curious and ancient forms
He recalled having heard somewhere or read it might be that they were a people much given to songs and music
And the young lady that very handsome and friendly Miss Madden had told him that she was a musician
He had a new pleasure in turning this over in his mind
Of all the closed doors which his choice of a career had left along his pathway no other had for him such a magical fascination as that on which was graven the lute of Orpheus
He knew not even the alphabet of music and his conceptions of its possibilities ran but little beyond the best of the hymnsinging he had heard at Conferences yet none the less the longing for it raised on occasion such mutiny in his soul that more than once he had specifically prayed against it as a temptation
Dangerous though some of its tendencies might be there was no gainsaying the fact that a love for music was in the main an uplifting influencean attribute of cultivation
The world was the sweeter and more gentle for it
And this brought him to musing upon the odd chance that the two people of Octavius who had given him the first notion of polish and intellectual culture in the town should be Irish
The Romish priest must have been vastly surprised at his intrusion yet had been at the greatest pains to act as if it were quite the usual thing to have Methodist ministers assist at Extreme Unction
And the young woman how gracefully with what delicacy had she comprehended his position and robbed it of all its possible embarrassments
It occurred to him that they must have passed there in front of her home the very tree from which the luckless wheelwright had fallen some hours before and the fact that she had forborne to point it out to him took form in his mind as an added proof of her refinement of nature
The midday dinner was a little more than ready when Theron reached home and let himself in by the front door
On Mondays owing to the moisture and clutter of the weekly washing in the kitchen the table was laid in the sittingroom and as he entered from the hall the partner of his joys bustled in by the other door bearing the steaming platter of corned beef dumplings cabbages and carrots with arms bared to the elbows and a red face
It gave him great comfort however to note that there were no signs of the mornings displeasure remaining on this face and he immediately remembered again those interrupted projects of his about the piano and the hired girl
Well
Id just about begun to reckon that I was a widow said Alice putting down her fragrant burden
There was such an obvious suggestion of propitiation in her tone that Theron went around and kissed her
He thought of saying something about keeping out of the way because it was Blue Monday but held it back lest it should sound like a reproach
Well what kind of a washerwoman does THIS one turn out to be
he asked after they were seated and he had invoked a blessing and was cutting vigorously into the meat
Oh soso replied Alice she seems to be particular but shes mortal slow
If I hadnt stood right over her we shouldnt have had the clothes out till goodness knows when
And of course shes Irish
Well what of THAT
asked the minister with a fine unconcern
Alice looked up from her plate with knife and fork suspended in air
Why you know we were talking only the other day of what a pity it was that none of our own people went out washing she said
That Welsh woman we heard of couldnt come after all and they say too that she presumes dreadfully upon the acquaintance being a church member you know
So we simply had to fall back on the Irish
And even if they do go and tell their priest everything they see and hear why theres one comfort they can tell about US and welcome
Of course I see to it she doesnt snoop around in here
Theron smiled
Thats all nonsense about their telling such things to their priests he said with easy confidence
Why you told me so yourself replied Alice briskly
And Ive always understood so too theyre bound to tell EVERYTHING in confession
Thats what gives the Catholic Church such a tremendous hold
Youve spoken of it often
It must have been by way of a figure of speech remarked Theron not with entire directness
Women are great hands to separate ones observations from their context and so give them meanings quite unintended
They are also great hands he added genially or at least one of them is at making the most delicious dumplings in the world
I believe these are the best even you ever made
Alice was not unmindful of the compliment but her thoughts were on other things
I shouldnt like that womans priest for example she said to know that we had no piano
But if he comes and stands outside our house every night and listensas of course he will said Theron with mock gravity it is only a question of time when he must reach that conclusion for himself
Our only chance however is that there are some sixteen hundred other houses for him to watch so that he may not get around to us for quite a spell
Why seriously Alice what on earth do you suppose Father Forbes knows or cares about our poor little affairs or those of any other Protestant household in this whole village
He has his work to do just as I have mineonly his is ten times as exacting in everything except sermonsand you may be sure he is only too glad when it is over each day without bothering about things that are none of his business
All the same Im afraid of them said Alice as if argument were exhausted
CHAPTER VI On the following morning young Mr Ware anticipated events by inscribing in his diary for the day immediately after breakfast these remarks Arranged about piano
Began work upon book
The date indeed deserved to be distinguished from its fellows
Theron was so conscious of its importance that he not only prophesied in the little moroccobound diary which Alice had given him for Christmas but returned after he had got out upon the front steps of the parsonage to have his hat brushed afresh by her
Wonders will never cease she said jocosely
With you getting particular about your clothes there isnt anything in this wide world that cant happen now
One doesnt go out to bring home a piano every day he made answer
Besides I want to make such an impression upon the man that he will deal gently with that first cash payment down
Do you know he added watching her turn the felt brim under the wispbrooms strokes Im thinking some of getting me a regular silk stovepipe hat
Why dont you then
she rejoined but without any ring of glad acquiescence in her tone
He fancied that her face lengthened a little and he instantly ascribed it to recollections of the way in which the roses had been bullied out of her own headgear
You are quite sure now pet he made haste to change the subject that the hired girl can wait just as well as not until fall
Oh MY yes
Alice replied putting the hat on his head and smoothing back his hair behind his ears
Shed only be in the way now
You see with hot weather coming on there wont be much cooking
Well take all our meals out here and that saves so much work that really what remains is hardly more than taking care of a birdcage
And besides not having her will almost half pay for the piano
But when cold weather comes youre sure youll consent
he urged
Like a shot
she assured him and after a happy little caress he started out again on his momentous mission
Thurstons was a place concerning which opinions differed in Octavius
That it typified progress and helped more than any other feature of the village to bring it up to date no one indeed disputed
One might move about a great deal in truth and hear no other view expressed
But then again one might stumble into conversation with one small storekeeper after another and learn that they united in resenting the existence of Thurstons as rival farmers might join to curse a protracted drought
Each had his special flaming grievance
The little drygoods dealers asked mournfully how they could be expected to compete with an establishment which could buy bankrupt stocks at a hundred different points and make a profit if only onethird of the articles were sold for more than they would cost from the jobber
The little boot and shoe dealers clothiers hatters and furriers the small merchants in carpets crockery and furniture the venders of hardware and household utensils of leathern goods and pictureframes of wallpaper musical instruments and even toysall had the same pathetically unanswerable question to propound
But mostly they put it to themselves because the others were at Thurstons
The Rev
Theron Ware had entertained rather strong views on this subject and that only a week or two ago
One of his first acquaintances in Octavius had been the owner of the principal bookstore in the place a gentle and bald old man who produced the complete impression of a bibliophile upon what the slightest investigation showed to be only a meagre acquaintance with publishers circulars
But at least he had the air of loving his business and the young minister had enjoyed a long talk with or rather at him
Out of this talk had come the information that the store was losing money
Not even the stationery department now showed a profit worth mentioning
When Octavius had contained only five thousand inhabitants it boasted four bookstores two of them good ones
Now with a population more than doubled only these latter two survived and they must soon go to the wall
The reason
It was in a nutshell
A book which sold at retail for one dollar and a half cost the bookseller ninety cents
If it was at all a popular book Thurstons advertised it at eightynine cents and in any case at a profit of only two or three cents
Of course it was done to widen the establishments patronage to bring people into the store
Equally of course it was destroying the book business and debauching the reading tastes of the community
Without the profits from the light and ephemeral popular literature of the season the bookstore proper could not keep up its stock of more solid works and indeed could not long keep open at all
On the other hand Thurstons dealt with nothing save the demand of the moment and offered only the books which were the talk of the week
Thus in plain words the book trade was going to the dogs and it was the same with pretty nearly every other trade
Theron was indignant at this and on his return home told Alice that he desired her to make no purchases whatever at Thurstons
He even resolved to preach a sermon on the subject of the modern idea of admiring the great for crushing the small and sketched out some notes for it which he thought solved the problem of flaying the local abuse without mentioning it by name
They had lain on his desk now for ten days or more and on only the previous Friday he had speculated upon using them that coming Sunday
On this bright and cheerful Tuesday morning he walked with a blithe step unhesitatingly down the main street to Thurstons and entered without any show of repugnance the door next to the window wherein flanked by dangling banjos and keybugles built in pyramids was displayed the sign Pianos on the Instalment Plan
He was recognized by some responsible persons and treated with distinguished deference
They were charmed with the intelligence that he desired a piano and fascinated by his wish to pay for it only a little at a time
They had special terms for clergymen and made him feel as if these were being extended to him on a silver charger by kneeling admirers
It was so easy to buy things here that he was a trifle disturbed to find his flowing course interrupted by his own entire ignorance as to what kind of piano he wanted
He looked at all they had in stock and heard them played upon
They differed greatly in price and so he fancied almost as much in tone
It discouraged him to note however that several of those he thought the finest in tone were among the very cheapest in the lot
Pondering this and staring in hopeless puzzlement from one to another of the big black shiny monsters he suddenly thought of something
I would rather not decide for myself he said I know so little about it
If you dont mind I will have a friend of mine a skilled musician step in and make a selection
I have so much confidence inin her judgment
He added hurriedly It will involve only a day or twos delay
The next moment he was sorry he had spoken
What would they think when they saw the organist of the Catholic church come to pick out a piano for the Methodist parsonage
And how could he decorously prefer the request to her to undertake this task
He might not meet her again for ages and to his provincial notions writing would have seemed out of the question
And would it not be disagreeable to have her know that he was buying a piano by part payments
Poor Alices dread of the washerwomans gossip occurred to him at this and he smiled in spite of himself
Then all at once the difficulty vanished
Of course it would come all right somehow
Everything did
He was on firmer ground buying the materials for the new book over on the stationery side
His original intention had been to bestow this patronage upon the old bookseller but these suavely smart people in Thurstons had had the effect of putting him on his honor when they asked Would there be anything else
and he had followed them unresistingly
He indulged to the full his whim that everything entering into the construction of Abraham should be spickandspan
He watched with his own eyes a whole ream of broad glazed white paper being sliced down by the cutter into single sheets and thrilled with a novel ecstasy as he laid his hand upon the spotless bulk so wooingly did it invite him to begin
He tried a score of pens before the right one came to hand
When a box of these had been laid aside with ink and penholders and a little bronze inkstand he made a sign that the outfit was complete
Or no there must be some blottingpaper
He had always used those blottingpads given away by insurance companies his congregations never failed to contain one or more agents who had these to bestow by the armfulbut the book deserved a virgin blotter
Theron stood by while all these things were being tied up together in a parcel
The suggestion that they should be sent almost hurt him
Oh no he would carry them home himself
So strongly did they appeal to his sanguine imagination that he could not forbear hinting to the man who had shown him the pianos and was now accompanying him to the door that this package under his arm represented potentially the price of the piano he was going to have
He did it in a roundabout way with one of his droll hesitating smiles
The man did not understand at all and Theron had not the temerity to repeat the remark
He strode home with the precious bundle as fast as he could
I thought it best after all not to commit myself to a selection he explained about the piano at dinnertime
In such a matter as this the opinion of an expert is everything
I am going to have one of the principal musicians of the town go and try them all and tell me which we ought to have
And while hes about it said Alice you might ask him to make a little list of some of the new music
Ive got way behind the times being without a piano so long
Tell him not any VERY difficult pieces you know
Yes I know put in Theron almost hastily and began talking of other things
His conversation was of the most rambling and desultory sort because all the while the two lobes of his brain as it were kept up a dispute as to whether Alice ought to have been told that this principal musician was of her own sex
It would certainly have been better at the outset he decided but to mention it now would be to invest the fact with undue importance
Yes that was quite clear only the clearer it became from one point of view the shadier it waxed from the other
The problem really disturbed the young ministers mind throughout the meal and his abstraction became so marked at last that his wife commented upon it
A penny for your thoughts
she said with cheerful briskness
This ancient formula of the farmland had always rather jarred on Theron
It presented itself now to his mind as a peculiarly aggravating banality
I am going to begin my book this afternoon he remarked impressively
There is a great deal to think about
It turned out that there was even more to think about than he had imagined
After hours of solitary musing at his desk or of pacing up and down before his open bookshelves Theron found the first shadows of a Mayday twilight beginning to fall upon that beautiful pile of white paper still unstained by ink
He saw the book he wanted to write before him in his mental vision much more distinctly than ever but the idea of beginning it impetuously and hurling it off hot and glowing week by week had faded away like a dream
This long afternoon spent face to face with a project born of his own brain but yesterday yet already so much bigger than himself was really a most fruitful time for the young clergyman
The lessons which cut most deeply into our consciousness are those we learn from our children
Theron in this first days contact with the offspring of his fancy found revealed to him an unsuspected and staggering truth
It was that he was an extremely ignorant and rudely untrained young man whose pretensions to intellectual authority among any educated people would be laughed at with deserved contempt
Strangely enough after he had weathered the first shock this discovery did not dismay Theron Ware
The very completeness of the conviction it carried with it saturated his mind with a feeling as if the fact had really been known to him all along
And there came too after a little an almost pleasurable sense of the importance of the revelation
He had been merely drifting in fatuous and conceited blindness
Now all at once his eyes were open he knew what he had to do
Ignorance was a thing to be remedied and he would forthwith bend all his energies to cultivating his mind till it should blossom like a garden
In this mood Theron mentally measured himself against the more conspicuous of his colleagues in the Conference
They also were ignorant clownishly ignorant the difference was that they were doomed by native incapacity to go on all their lives without ever finding it out
It was obvious to him that his case was better
There was bright promise in the very fact that he had discovered his shortcomings
He had begun the afternoon by taking down from their places the various works in his meagre library which bore more or less relation to the task in hand
The threescore books which constituted his printed possessions were almost wholly from the press of the Book Concern the few exceptions were volumes which though published elsewhere had come to him through that giant circulating agency of the General Conference and wore the stamp of its approval
Perhaps it was the sight of these halffilled shelves which started this days great revolution in Therons opinions of himself
He had never thought much before about owning books
He had been too poor to buy many and the conditions of canvassing about among ones parishioners which the thrifty Book Concern imposes upon those who would have without buying had always repelled him
Now suddenly as he moved along the two shelves he felt ashamed at their beggarly showing
The Land and the Book in three portly volumes was the most pretentious of the aids which he finally culled from his collection
Beside it he laid out Bible Lands Rivers and Lakes of Scripture Bible Manners and Customs the Genesis and Exodus volume of Whedons Commentary some old numbers of the Methodist Quarterly Review and a copy of Josephus which had belonged to his grandmother and had seen him through many a weary Sunday afternoon in boyhood
He glanced casually through these one by one as he took them down and began to fear that they were not going to be of so much use as he had thought
Then seating himself he read carefully through the thirteen chapters of Genesis which chronicle the story of the founder of Israel
Of course he had known this story from his earliest years
In almost every chapter he came now upon a phrase or an incident which had served him as the basis for a sermon
He had preached about Hagar in the wilderness about Lots wife about the visit of the angels about the intended sacrifice of Isaac about a dozen other things suggested by the ancient narrative
Somehow this time it all seemed different to him
The people he read about were altered to his vision
Heretofore a poetic light had shone about them where indeed they had not glowed in a halo of sanctification
Now by some chance this light was gone and he saw them instead as untutored and unwashed barbarians filled with animal lusts and ferocities struggling by violence and foul chicanery to secure a foothold in a country which did not belong to them all rude tramps and robbers of the uncivilized plain
The apparent fact that Abram was a Chaldean struck him with peculiar force
How was it he wondered that this had never occurred to him before
Examining himself he found that he had supposed vaguely that there had been Jews from the beginning or at least say from the flood
But no Abram was introduced simply as a citizen of the Chaldean town of Ur and there was no hint of any difference in race between him and his neighbors
It was specially mentioned that his brother Lots father died in Ur the city of his nativity
Evidently the family belonged there and were Chaldeans like the rest
I do not cite this as at all a striking discovery but it did have a curious effect upon Theron Ware
Up to that very afternoon his notion of the kind of book he wanted to write had been founded upon a popular book called Ruth the Moabitess written by a clergyman he knew very well the Rev
E Ray Mifflin
This model performance troubled itself not at all with difficult points but went swimmingly along through scented summer seas of pretty rhetoric teaching nothing it is true but pleasing a good deal and selling like hot cakes
Now all at once Theron felt that he hated that sort of book
HIS work should be of a vastly different order
He might fairly assume he thought that if the fact that Abram was a Chaldean was new to him it would fall upon the world in general as a novelty
Very well then there was his chance
He would write a learned book showing who the Chaldeans were and how their manners and beliefs differed from and influenced It was at this psychological instant that the wave of selfcondemnation suddenly burst upon and submerged the young clergyman
It passed again leaving him staring fixedly at the pile of books he had taken down from the shelves and gasping a little as if for breath
Then the humorous side of the thing perversely enough appealed to him and he grinned feebly to himself at the joke of his having imagined that he could write learnedly about the Chaldeans or anything else
But no it shouldnt remain a joke
His long mobile face grew serious under the new resolve
He would learn what there was to be learned about the Chaldeans
He rose and walked up and down the room gathering fresh strength of purpose as this inviting field of research spread out its vistas before him
Perhapsyes he would incidentally explore the mysteries of the Moabitic past as well and thus put the Rev
E Ray Mifflin to confusion on his own subject
That would in itself be a useful thing because Mifflin wore kid gloves at the Conference and affected an intolerable superiority of dress and demeanor and there would be general satisfaction among the plainer and worthier brethren at seeing him taken down a peg
Now for the first time there rose distinctly in Therons mind that casual allusion which Father Forbes had made to the Turanians
He recalled too his momentary feeling of mortification at not knowing who the Turanians were at the time
Possibly if he had probed this matter more deeply now as he walked and pondered in the little livingroom he might have traced the whole of the afternoons mental experiences to that chance remark of the Romish priest
But this speculation did not detain him
He mused instead upon the splendid library Father Forbes must have
Well how does the book come on
Have you got to my Lady Keturah yet
It was Alice who spoke opening the door from the kitchen and putting in her head with a pretence of great and solemn caution but with a correcting twinkle in her eyes
I havent got to anybody yet answered Theron absently
These big things must be approached slowly
Come out to supper then while the beans are hot said Alice
The young minister sat through this other meal again in deep abstraction
His wife pursued her little pleasantry about Keturah the second wife urging him with mock gravity to scold her roundly for daring to usurp Sarahs place but Theron scarcely heard her and said next to nothing
He ate sparingly and fidgeted in his seat waiting with obvious impatience for the finish of the meal
At last he rose abruptly
Ive got a call to makesomething with reference to the book he said
Ill run out now I think before it gets dark
He put on his hat and strode out of the house as if his errand was of the utmost urgency
Once upon the street however his pace slackened
There was still a good deal of daylight outside and he loitered aimlessly about walking with bowed head and hands clasped behind him until dusk fell
Then he squared his shoulders and started straight as the crow flies toward the residence of Father Forbes
CHAPTER VII The new Catholic church was the largest and most imposing public building in Octavius
Even in its unfinished condition with a bald roofing of weatherbeaten boards marking on the stunted tower the place where a spire was to begin later on it dwarfed every other edifice of the sort in the town just as it put them all to shame in the matter of the throngs it drew rain or shine to its services
These facts had not heretofore been a source of satisfaction to the Rev
Theron Ware
He had even alluded to the subject in terms which gave his wife the impression that he actively deplored the strength and size of the Catholic denomination in this new home of theirs and was troubled in his mind about Rome generally
But this evening he walked along the extended side of the big structure which occupied nearly half the block and then turning the corner passed in review its widedoored looming front without any hostile emotions whatever
In the gathering dusk it seemed more massive than ever before but he found himself only passively considering the odd statement he had heard that all Catholic Church property was deeded absolutely in the name of the Bishop of the diocese
Only a narrow passageway separated the church from the pastoratea fine new brick residence standing flush upon the street
Theron mounted the steps and looked about for a bellpull
Search revealed instead a little ivory button set in a ring of metal work
He picked at this for a time with his fingernail before he made out the injunction printed across it to push
Of course
how stupid of him
This was one of those electric bells he had heard so much of but which had not as yet made their way to the class of homes he knew
For custodians of a mediaeval superstition and fanaticism the Catholic clergy seemed very much up to date
This bell made him feel rather more a countryman than ever
The door was opened by a tall gaunt woman who stood in black relief against the radiance of the hallway while Theron choosing his words with some diffidence asked if the Rev
Mr Forbes was in
He is came the hushvoiced answer
Hes at dinner though
It took the young minister a second or two to bring into association in his mind this evening hour and this midday meal
Then he began to say that he would call again it was nothing specialbut the woman suddenly cut him short by throwing the door wide open
Its Mr Ware is it not
she asked in a greatly altered tone
Sure hed not have you go away
Come insidedo sirIll tell him
Theron with a dumb show of reluctance crossed the threshold
He noted now that the woman who had bustled down the hall on her errand was grayhaired and incredibly ugly with a dark sour face glowering black eyes and a twisted mouth
Then he saw that he was not alone in the hallway
Three men and two women all poorly clad and obviously working people were seated in meek silence on a bench beyond the hatrack
They glanced up at him for an instant then resumed their patient study of the linoleum pattern on the floor at their feet
And will you kindly step in sir
the elderly Gorgon had returned to ask
She led Mr Ware along the hallway to a door near the end and opened it for him to pass before her
He entered a room in which for the moment he could see nothing but a central glare of dazzling light beating down from a great shaded lamp upon a circular patch of white table linen
Inside this ring of illumination points of fire sparkled from silver and porcelain and two bars of burning crimson tracked across the cloth in reflection from tall glasses filled with wine
The rest of the room was vague darkness but the gloom seemed saturated with novel aromatic odors the appetizing scent of which bore clear relation to what Therons blinking eyes rested upon
He was able now to discern two figures at the table outside the glowing circle of the lamp
They had both risen and one came toward him with cordial celerity holding out a white plump hand in greeting
He took this proffered hand rather limply not wholly sure in the halflight that this really was Father Forbes and began once more that everlasting apology to which he seemed doomed in the presence of the priest
It was broken abruptly off by the others protesting laughter
My dear Mr Ware I beg of you the priest urged chuckling with hospitable mirth dont dont apologize
I give you my word nothing in the world could have pleased us better than your joining us here tonight
It was quite dramatic your coming in as you did
We were speaking of you at that very moment
Oh I forgot let me make you acquainted with my friendmy very particular friend Dr Ledsmar
Let me take your hat pray draw up a chair
Maggie will have a place laid for you in a minute
Oh I assure youI couldnt think of itIve just eaten mymydinner expostulated Theron
He murmured more inarticulate remonstrances a moment later when the grim old domestic appeared with plates serviette and tableware for his use but she went on spreading them before him as if she heard nothing
Thus committed against a decent show of resistance the young minister did eat a little here and there of what was set before him and was human enough to regret frankly that he could not eat more
It seemed to him very remarkable cookery transfiguring so simple a thing as a steak for example quite out of recognition and investing the humble potato with a charm he had never dreamed of
He wondered from time to time if it would be polite to ask how the potatoes were cooked so that he might tell Alice
The conversation at the table was not continuous or even enlivened
After the lapses into silence became marked Theron began to suspect that his refusal to drink wine had annoyed themthe more so as he had drenched a large section of tablecloth in his efforts to manipulate a siphon instead
He was greatly relieved therefore when Father Forbes explained in an incidental way that Dr Ledsmar and he customarily ate their meals almost without a word
Its a philosophic fad of his the priest went on smilingly and I have fallen in with it for the sake of a quiet life so that when we do have companythat is to say once in a blue moonwe display no manners to speak of I had always supposedthat is Ive always heard that it was more healthful to talk at meals said Theron
Of coursewhat I meanI took it for granted all physicians thought so
Dr Ledsmar laughed
That depends so much upon the quality of the meals
he remarked holding his glass up to the light
He seemed a man of middle age and an equable disposition
Theron stealing stray glances at him around the lampshade saw most distinctly of all a broad impressive dome of skull which though obviously the result of baldness gave the effect of quite belonging to the face
There were goldrimmed spectacles through which shone now and again the vivid sparkle of sharp alert eyes and there was a nose of some sort not easy to classify at once long and thick
The rest was thin hair and short round beard mousecolored where the light caught them but losing their outlines in the shadows of the background
Theron had not heard of him among the physicians of Octavius
He wondered if he might not be a doctor of something else than medicine and decided upon venturing the question
Oh yes it is medicine replied Ledsmar
I am a doctor three or four times over so far as parchments can make one
In some other respects though I should think I am probably less of a doctor than anybody else now living
I havent practisedthat is regularlyfor many years and I take no interest whatever in keeping abreast of what the profession regards as its progress
I know nothing beyond what was being taught in the sixties and that I am glad to say I have mostly forgotten
Dear me
said Theron
I had always supposed that Science was the most engrossing of pursuitsthat once a man took it up he never left it
But that would imply a connection between Science and Medicine
commented the doctor
My dear sir they are not even on speaking terms
Shall we go upstairs
put in the priest rising from his chair
It will be more comfortable to have our coffee there unless indeed Mr Ware tobacco is unpleasant to you
Oh my no
the young minister exclaimed eager to free himself from the suggestion of being a killjoy
I dont smoke myself but I am very fond of the odor I assure you
Father Forbes led the way out
It could be seen now that he wore a long housegown of black silk skilfully moulded to his erect shapely and rounded form
Though he carried this with the natural grace of a proud and beautiful belle there was no hint of the feminine in his bearing or in the contour of his pale firmset handsome face
As he moved through the hallway the five people whom Theron had seen waiting rose from their bench and two of the women began in humble murmurs If you please Father and Goodevening to your Riverence but the priest merely nodded and passed on up the staircase followed by his guests
The people sat down on their bench again
A few minutes later reclining at his ease in a huge low chair and feeling himself unaccountably at home in the most luxuriously appointed and delightful little room he had ever seen the Rev
Theron Ware sipped his unaccustomed coffee and embarked upon an explanation of his errand
Somehow the very profusion of scholarly symbols about him the great dark rows of encased and crowded bookshelves rising to the ceiling the classical engravings upon the wall the revolving bookcase the readingstand the mass of littered magazines reviews and papers at either end of the costly and elaborate writingdesk seemed to make it the easier for him to explain without reproach that he needed information about Abram
He told them quite in detail the story of his book
The two others sat watching him through a faint haze of scented smoke with polite encouragement on their faces
Father Forbes took the added trouble to nod understandingly at the various points of the narrative and when it was finished gave one of his little approving chuckles
This skirts very closely upon sorcery he said smilingly
Do you know there is perhaps not another man in the country who knows Assyriology so thoroughly as our friend here Dr
Ledsmar
Thats putting it too strong remarked the Doctor
I only follow at a distancea year or two behind
But I daresay I can help you
You are quite welcome to anything I have my books cover the ground pretty well up to last year
Delitzsch is very interesting but Baudissins Studien zur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte would come closer to what you need
There are several other important GermansSchrader Bunsen Duncker Hommel and so on
Unluckily II dont read German readily Theron explained with diffidence
Thats a pity said the doctor because they do the best worknot only in this field but in most others
And they do so much that the mass defies translation
Well the best thing outside of German of course is Sayce
I daresay you know him though
The Rev
Mr Ware shook his head mournfully
I dont seem to know any one he murmured
The others exchanged glances
But if I may ask Mr Ware pursued the doctor regarding their guest with interest through his spectacles why do you specially hit upon Abraham
He is full of difficultiesenough just now at any rate to warn off the bravest scholar
Why not take something easier
Theron had recovered something of his confidence
Oh no he said that is just what attracts me to Abraham
I like the complexities and contradictions in his character
Take for instance all that strange and picturesque episode of Hagar see the splendid contrast between the craft and commercial guile of his dealings in Egypt and with Abimelech and the simple straightforward godliness of his later years
No all those difficulties only attract me
Do you happen to knowof course you would knowdo those German books or the others give anywhere any additional details of the man himself and his sayings and doings little things which help you know to round out ones conception of the individual
Again the priest and the doctor stole a furtive glance across the young ministers head
It was Father Forbes who replied
I fear that you are taking our friend Abraham too literally Mr Ware he said in that gentle semblance of paternal tones which seemed to go so well with his gown
Modern research you know quite wipes him out of existence as an individual
The word Abram is merely an eponym it means exalted father
Practically all the names in the Genesis chronologies are what we call eponymous
Abram is not a person at all he is a tribe a sept a clan
In the same way Shem is not intended for a man it is the name of a great division of the human race
Heber is simply the throwing back into allegorical substance so to speak of the Hebrews Heth of the Hittites Asshur of Assyria
But this is something very new this theory isnt it
queried Theron
The priest smiled and shook his head
Bless you no
My dear sir there is nothing new
Epicurus and Lucretius outlined the whole Darwinian theory more than two thousand years ago
As for this eponym thing why Saint Augustine called attention to it fifteen hundred years ago
In his De Civitate Dei he expressly says of these genealogical names GENTES NON HOMINES that is peoples not persons
It was as obvious to himas much a commonplace of knowledge as it was to Ezekiel eight hundred years before him
It seems passing strange that we should not know it now then commented Theron I mean that everybody shouldnt know it
Father Forbes gave a little purring chuckle
Ah there we get upon contentious ground he remarked
Why should everybody be supposed to know anything at all
What business is it of everybodys to know things
The earth was just as round in the days when people supposed it to be flat as it is now
So the truth remains always the truth even though you give a charter to ten hundred thousand separate numskulls to examine it by the light of their private judgment and report that it is as many different varieties of something else
But of course that whole question of private judgment versus authority is NoMansLand for us
We were speaking of eponyms
Yes said Theron it is very interesting
There is a curious phase of the subject which hasnt been worked out much continued the priest
Probably the Germans will get at that too sometime
They are doing the best Irish work in other fields as it is
I spoke of Heber and Heth in Genesis as meaning the Hebrews and the Hittites
Now my own people the Irish have far more ancient legends and traditions than any other nation west of Athens and you find in their myth of the Milesian invasion and conquest two principal leaders called Heber and Ith or Heth
That is supposed to be comparatively modern about the time of Solomons Temple
But these independent Irish myths go back to the fall of the Tower of Babel and they have there an ancestor grandson of Japhet named Fenius Farsa and they ascribe to him the invention of the alphabet
They took their ancient name of Feine the modern Fenian from him
Oddly enough that is the name which the Romans knew the Phoenicians by and to them also is ascribed the invention of the alphabet
The Irish have a holy salmon of knowledge just like the Chaldean manfish
The Druids treeworship is identical with that of the Chaldeansthose pagan groves you know which the Jews were always being punished for building
You see there is nothing new
Everything is built on the ruins of something else
Just as the material earth is made up of countless billions of dead mens bones so the mental world is all alive with the ghosts of dead mens thoughts and beliefs the wraiths of dead races faiths and imaginings
Father Forbes paused then added with a twinkle in his eye That peroration is from an old sermon of mine in the days when I used to preach
I remember rather liking it at the time
But you still preach
asked the Rev
Mr Ware with lifted brows
No
no more
I only talk now and again answered the priest with what seemed a suggestion of curtness
He made haste to take the conversation back again
The names of these deadandgone things are singularly pertinacious though
They survive indefinitely
Take the modern name Marmaduke for example
It strikes one as peculiarly modern uptodate doesnt it
Well it is the oldest name on earth thousands of years older than Adam
It is the ancient Chaldean Meridug or Merodach
He was the young god who interceded continually between the angry omnipotent Ea his father and the humble and unhappy Damkina or Earth who was his mother
This is interesting from another point of view because this Merodach or Marmaduke is so far as we can see now the original prototype of our divine intermediary idea
I daresay though that if we could go back still other scores of centuries we should find whole receding series of types of this Christmyth of ours
Theron Ware sat upright at the fall of these words and flung a swift startled look about the room the instinctive glance of a man unexpectedly confronted with peril and casting desperately about for means of defence and escape
For the instant his mind was aflame with this vivid impressionthat he was among sinister enemies at the mercy of criminals
He half rose under the impelling stress of this feeling with the sweat standing on his brow and his jaw dropped in a scared and bewildered stare
Then quite as suddenly the sense of shock was gone and it was as if nothing at all had happened
He drew a long breath took another sip of his coffee and found himself all at once reflecting almost pleasurably upon the charm of contact with really educated people
He leaned back in the big chair again and smiled to show these men of the world how much at his ease he was
It required an effort he discovered but he made it bravely and hoped he was succeeding
It hasnt been in my power to at all lay hold of what the world keeps on learning nowadays about its babyhood he said
All I have done is to try to preserve an open mind and to maintain my faith that the more we know the nearer we shall approach the Throne
Dr Ledsmar abruptly scuffled his feet on the floor and took out his watch
Im afraid he began
No no
Theres plenty of time remarked the priest with his soft halfsmile and purring tones
You finish your cigar here with Mr Ware and excuse me while I run down and get rid of the people in the hall
Father Forbes tossed his cigarend into the fender
Then he took from the mantel a strange threecornered blackvelvet cap with a dangling silk tassel at the side put it on his head and went out
Theron being left alone with the doctor hardly knew what to do or say
He took up a paper from the floor beside him but realized that it would be impolite to go farther and laid it on his knee
Some trace of that earlier momentary feeling that he was in hostile hands came back and worried him
He lifted himself upright in the chair and then became conscious that what really disturbed him was the fact that Dr Ledsmar had turned in his seat crossed his legs and was contemplating him with a gravely concentrated scrutiny through his spectacles
This uncomfortable gaze kept itself up a long way beyond the point of good manners but the doctor seemed not to mind that at all
CHAPTER VIII When Dr Ledsmar finally spoke it was in a kindlier tone than the young minister had looked for
I had half a notion of going to hear you preach the other evening he said but at the last minute I backed out
I daresay I shall pluck up the courage sooner or later and really go
It must be fully twenty years since I last heard a sermon and I had supposed that that would suffice for the rest of my life
But they tell me that you are worth while and for some reason or other I find myself curious on the subject
Involved and dubious though the compliment might be Theron felt himself flushing with satisfaction
He nodded his acknowledgment and changed the topic
I was surprised to hear Father Forbes say that he did not preach he remarked
Why should he
asked the doctor indifferently
I suppose he hasnt more than fifteen parishioners in a thousand who would understand him if he did and of these probably twelve would join in a complaint to his Bishop about the heterodox tone of his sermon
There is no point in his going to all that pains merely to incur that risk
Nobody wants him to preach and he has reached an age where personal vanity no longer tempts him to do so
What IS wanted of him is that he should be the paternal ceremonial authoritative head and centre of his flock adviser monitor overseer elder brother friend patron seigneurwhatever you like everything except a bore
They draw the line at that
You see how diametrically opposed this Catholic point of view is to the Protestant
The difference does seem extremely curious to me said Theron
Now those people in the hall Go on put in the doctor as the other faltered hesitatingly
I know what you were going to say
It struck you as odd that he should let them wait on the bench there while he came up here to smoke
Theron smiled faintly
I WAS thinking that my my parishioners wouldnt have taken it so quietly
But of courseit is all so different
As chalk from cheese
said Dr Ledsmar lighting a fresh cigar
I daresay every one you saw there had come either to take the pledge or see to it that one of the others took it
That is the chief industry in the hall so far as I have observed
Now discipline is an important element in the machinery here
Coming to take the pledge implies that you have been drunk and are now ashamed
Both states have their values but they are opposed
Sitting on that bench tends to develop penitence to the prejudice of alcoholism
But at no stage would it ever occur to the occupant of the bench that he was the best judge of how long he was to sit there or that his priest should interrupt his dinner or general personal routine in order to administer that pledge
Now I daresay you have no people at all coming to swear off
The Rev
Mr Ware shook his head
No if a man with us got as bad as all that he wouldnt come near the church at all
Hed simply drop out and there would be an end to it
Quite so interjected the doctor
That is the voluntary system
But these fellows cant drop out
Theres no bottom to the Catholic Church
Everything thats in stays in
If you dont mind my saying so of course I view you all impartially from the outside but it seems logical to me that a church should exist for those who need its help and not for those who by their own profession are so good already that it is they who help the church
Now you turn a man out of your church who behaves badly that must be on the theory that his remaining in would injure the church and that in turn involves the idea that it is the excellent character of the parishioners which imparts virtue to the church
The Catholics conception you see is quite the converse
Such virtue as they keep in stock is on tap so to speak here in the church itself and the parishioners come and get some for themselves according to their need for it
Some come every day some only once a year some perhaps never between their baptism and their funeral
But they all have a right here the professional burglar every whit as much as the speckless saint
The only stipulation is that they oughtnt to come under false pretences the burglar is in honor bound not to pass himself off to his priest as the saint
But that is merely a moral obligation established in the burglars own interest
It does him no good to come unless he feels that he is playing the rules of the game and one of these is confession
If he cheats there he knows that he is cheating nobody but himself and might much better have stopped away altogether
Theron nodded his head comprehendingly
He had a great many views about the Romanish rite of confession which did not at all square with this statement of the case but this did not seem a specially fit time for bringing them forth
There was indeed a sense of languid repletion in his mind as if it had been overfed and wanted to lie down for awhile
He contented himself with nodding again and murmuring reflectively Yes it is all strangely different
His tone was an invitation to silence and the doctor turned his attention to the cigar studying its ash for a minute with an air of deep meditation and then solemnly blowing out a slow series of smokerings
Theron watched him with an indolent placid eye wondering lazily if it was after all so very pleasant to smoke
There fell upon this silencewith a softness so delicate that it came almost like a progression in the hush the sound of sweet music
For a little strain and source were alike indefinitean impalpable setting to harmony of the mellowed light the perfumed opalescence of the air the luxury and charm of the room
Then it rose as by a sweeping curve of beauty into a firm calm severe melody delicious to the ear but as cold in the minds vision as moonlit sculpture
It went on upward with stately collectedness of power till the atmosphere seemed all alive with the trembling consciousness of the presence of lofty souls sternly pure and pitilessly great
Theron found himself moved as he had never been before
He almost resented the discovery when it was presented to him by the prosaic mechanical side of his brain that he was listening to organmusic and that it came through the open window from the church close by
He would fain have reclined in his chair and closed his eyes and saturated himself with the uttermost fulness of the sensation
Yet in absurd despite of himself he rose and moved over to the window
Only a narrow alley separated the pastorate from the church Mr Ware could have touched with a walkingstick the opposite wall
Indirectly facing him was the arched and mullioned top of a great window
A dim light from within shone through the more translucent portions of the glass below throwing out faint little bars of partycolored radiance upon the blackness of the deep passageway
He could vaguely trace by these the outlines of some sort of picture on the window
There were human figures in it andyes up here in the centre nearest him was a womans head
There was a halo about it engirdling rich flowing waves of reddish hair the lights in which glowed like flame
The face itself was barely distinguishable but its halfsuggested form raised a curious sense of resemblance to some other face
He looked at it closely blankly the noble music throbbing through his brain meanwhile
Its that Madden girl
he suddenly heard a voice say by his side
Dr Ledsmar had followed him to the window and was close at his shoulder
Therons thoughts were upon the puzzling shadowed lineaments on the stained glass
He saw now in a flash the resemblance which had baffled him
It IS like her of course he said
Yes unfortunately it IS just like her replied the doctor with a hostile note in his voice
Whenever I am dining here she always goes in and kicks up that racket
She knows I hate it
Oh you mean that it is she who is playing remarked Theron
I thought you referred toat leastI was thinking of His sentence died off in inconsequence
He had a feeling that he did not want to talk with the doctor about the stainedglass likeness
The music had sunk away now into fragmentary and unconnected passages broken here and there by abrupt stops
Dr Ledsmar stretched an arm out past him and shut the window
Lets hear as little of the row as we can he said and the two went back to their chairs
Pardon me for the question the Rev
Mr Ware said after a pause which began to affect him as constrained but something you said about diningyou dont live here then
In the house I mean
The doctor laugheda characteristically abrupt dry little laugh which struck Theron at once as bearing a sort of blacksheep relationship to the priests habitual chuckle
That must have been puzzling you no end he saidthat notion that the pastorate kept a devils advocate on the premises
No Mr Ware I dont live here
I inhabit a house of my ownyou may have seen it an oldfashioned place up beyond the racecourse with a sort of tower at the back and a big garden
But I dine here three or four times a week
It is an old arrangement of ours
Vincent and I have been friends for many years now
We are quite alone in the world we twomuch to our mutual satisfaction
You must come up and see me some time come up and have a look over the books we were speaking of
I am much obliged said Theron without enthusiasm
The thought of the doctor by himself did not attract him greatly
The reservation in his tone seemed to interest the doctor
I suppose you are the first man I have asked in a dozen years he remarked frankly willing that the young minister should appreciate the favor extended him
It must be fully that since anybody but Vincent Forbes has been under my roof that is of my own species I mean
You live there quite alone commented Theron
Quitewith my dogs and cats and lizardsand my Chinaman
I mustnt forget him
The doctor noted the inquiry in the others lifted brows and smilingly explained
He is my solitary servant
Possibly he might not appeal to you much but I can assure you he used to interest Octavius a great deal when I first brought him here ten years ago or so
He afforded occupation for all the idle boys in the village for a twelvemonth at least
They used to lie in wait for him all day long with stones or horsechestnuts or snowballs according to the season
The Irishmen from the wagonworks nearly killed him once or twice but he patiently lived it all down
The Chinaman has the patience to live everything down the Caucasian races included
He will see us all to bed will that gentleman with the pigtail
The music over in the church had lifted itself again into form and sequence and defied the closed window
If anything it was louder than before and the sonorous roar of the basspedals seemed to be shaking the very walls
It was something with a biglunged exultant triumphing swing in it something which ought to have been sung on the battlefield at the close of day by the whole jubilant army of victors
It was impossible to pretend not to be listening to it but the doctor submitted with an obvious scowl and bit off the tip of his third cigar with an annoyed air
You dont seem to care much for music suggested Mr Ware when a lull came
Dr Ledsmar looked up lighted match in hand
Say musicians
he growled
Has it ever occurred to you he went on between puffs at the flame that the only animals who make the noises we call music are of the bird familya debased offshoot of the reptilian creation the very lowest types of the vertebrata now in existence
I insist upon the parallel among humans
I have in my time sir had considerable opportunities for studying close at hand the various orders of mammalia who devote themselves to what they describe as the arts
It may sound a harsh judgement but I am convinced that musicians stand on the very bottom rung of the ladder in the subcellar of human intelligence even lower than painters and actors
This seemed such unqualified nonsense to the Rev
Mr Ware that he offered no comment whatever upon it
He tried instead to divert his thoughts to the stormy strains which rolled in through the vibrating brickwork and to picture to himself the large capable figure of Miss Madden seated in the halflight at the organboard swaying to and fro in a splendid ecstasy of power as she evoked at will this superb and ordered uproar
But the doctor broke insistently in upon his musings
All art socalled is decay he said raising his voice
When a race begins to brood on the beautifulsocalled it is a sign of rot of getting ready to fall from the tree
Take the Jewsthose marvellous old fellows who were never more than a handful yet have imposed the rule of their ideas and their gods upon us for fifteen hundred years
Why
They were forbidden by their most fundamental law to make sculptures or pictures
That was at a time when the Egyptians when the Assyrians and other Semites were running to artistic riot
Every great museum in the world now has whole floors devoted to statues from the Nile and marvellous carvings from the palaces of Sargon and Assurbanipal
You can get the artistic remains of the Jews during that whole period into a childs wheelbarrow
They had the sense and strength to penalize art they alone survived
They saw the Egyptians go the Assyrians go the Greeks go the late Romans go the Moors in Spain goall the artistic peoples perish
They remained triumphing over all
Now at last their longbelated apogee is here their decline is at hand
I am told that in this present generation in Europe the Jews are producing a great lot of young painters and sculptors and actors just as for a century they have been producing famous composers and musicians
That means the end of the Jews
What
have you only got as far as that
came the welcome interruption of a cheery voice
Father Forbes had entered the room and stood looking down with a whimsical twinkle in his eye from one to the other of his guests
You must have been taken over the ground at a very slow pace Mr Ware he continued chuckling softly to have arrived merely at the collapse of the New Jerusalem
I fancied I had given him time enough to bring you straight up to the end of all of us with that Chinaman of his gently slapping our graves with his pigtail
Thats where the doctor always winds up if hes allowed to run his course
It has all been very interesting extremely so I assure you faltered Theron
It had become suddenly apparent to him that he desired nothing so much as to make his escape that he had indeed only been waiting for the hosts return to do so
He rose at this and explained that he must be going
No special effort being put forth to restrain him he presently made his way out Father Forbes hospitably following him down to the door and putting a very gracious cordiality into his adieux
The night was warm and black
Theron stood still in it the moment the pastorate door had closed the sudden darkness was so thick that it was as if he had closed his eyes
His dominant sensation was of a deep relief and rest after some undue fatigue
It crossed his mind that drunken men probably felt like that as they leaned against things on their way home
He was affected himself he saw by the weariness and halfnausea following a mental intoxication
The conceit pleased him and he smiled to himself as he turned and took the first homeward steps
It must be growing late he thought
Alice would be wondering as she waited
There was a street lamp at the corner and as he walked toward it he noted all at once that his feet were keeping step to the movement of the music proceeding from the organ within the churcha vaguely processional air marked enough in measure but still with a dreamy effect
It became a pleasure to identify his progress with the quaint rhythm of sound as he sauntered along
He discovered as he neared the light that he was instinctively stepping over the seams in the flagstone sidewalk as he had done as a boy
He smiled again at this
There was something exceptionally juvenile and buoyant about his mood now that he examined it
He set it down as a reaction from that doctors extravagant and incendiary talk
One thing was certainhe would never be caught up at that house beyond the racecourse with its reptiles and its Chinaman
Should he ever even go to the pastorate again
He decided not to quite definitely answer THAT in the negative but as he felt now the chances were all against it
Turning the corner and walking off into the shadows along the side of the huge church building Theron noted almost at the end of the edifice a small door the entrance to a porch coming out to the sidewalk which stood wide open
A thin pale vertical line of light showed that the inner door too was ajar
Through this wee aperture the organmusic reduced and mellowed by distance came to him again with that same curious intimate personal relation which had so moved him at the start before the doctor closed the window
It was as if it was being played for him alone
He paused for a doubting minute or two with bowed head listening to the exquisite harmony which floated out to caress and soothe and enfold him
There was no spiritual or at least pious effect in it now
He fancied that it must be secular music or if not then something adapted to marriage ceremoniesrich vivid passionate a celebration of beauty and the glory of possession with its ruling note of joy only heightened by soft wooing interludes and here and there the tremor of a fond timid little sob
Theron turned away irresolutely half frightened at the undreamtof impression this music was making upon him
Then all at once he wheeled and stepped boldly into the porch pushing the inner door open and hearing it rustle against its leathern frame as it swung to behind him
He had never been inside a Catholic church before
CHAPTER IX Jeremiah Madden was supposed to be probably the richest man in Octavius
There was no doubt at all about his being its least pretentious citizen
The huge and ornate modern mansion which he had built putting to shame every other house in the place gave an effect of ostentation to the Maddens as a family it seemed only to accentuate the air of humility which enveloped Jeremiah as with a garment
Everybody knew some version of the many tales afloat which in a kindly spirit illustrated the incongruity between him and his splendid habitation
Some had it that he slept in the shed
Others told whimsical stories of his sitting alone in the kitchen evenings smoking his old clay pipe and sorrowing because the second Mrs Madden would not suffer the pigs and chickens to come in and bear him company
But no matter how comic the exaggeration these legends were invariably amiable
It lay in no mans mouth to speak harshly of Jeremiah Madden
He had been born a Connemara peasant and he would die one
When he was ten years old he had seen some of his own family and most of his neighbors starve to death
He could remember looking at the stiffened figure of a woman stretched on the stones by the roadside with the green stain of nettles on her white lips
A girl five years or so older than himself also a Madden and distantly related had started in despair off across the mountains to the town where it was said the poorlaw officers were dealing out food
He could recall her coming back next day wildeyed with hunger and the fever the officers had refused her relief because her bare legs were not wholly shrunken to the bone
While theres a calf on the shank theres no starvation they had explained to her
The girl died without profiting by this official apothegm
The boy found it burned ineffaceably upon his brain
Now after a lapse of more than forty years it seemed the thing that he remembered best about Ireland
He had drifted westward as an unconsidered unresisting item in that vast flight of the famine years
Others whom he rubbed against in that melancholy exodus and deemed of much greater promise than himself had done badly
Somehow he did well
He learned the wheelwrights trade and really that seemed all there was to tell
The rest had been calm and sequent progressionsteady employment as a journeyman first then marriage and a house and lot the modest start as a master the move to Octavius and cheap lumber the growth of his business always marked of late years stupendousall following naturally easily one thing out of another
Jeremiah encountered the idea among his fellows now and again that he was entitled to feel proud of all this
He smiled to himself at the thought and then sent a sigh after the smile
What was it all but empty and transient vanity
The score of other Connemara boys he had knownnone very fortunate several broken tragically in prison or the gutter nearly all now gone the way of fleshwere as good as he
He could not have it in his heart to take credit for his success it would have been like sneering over their poor graves
Jeremiah Madden was now fiftythreea little man of a reddened weatherworn skin and a meditative almost saddened aspect
He had blue eyes but his scanty irongray hair showed raven black in its shadows
The width and prominence of his cheekbones dominated all ones recollections of his face
The long vertical upperlip and irregular teeth made in repose an unshapely mouth its smile though sweetened the whole countenance
He wore a fringe of stiff steelcolored beard passing from ear to ear under his chin
His weekday clothes were as simple as his workaday manners fitting his short black pipe and his steadfast devotion to his business
On Sundays he dressed with a certain rigor of respectability all in black and laid aside tobacco at least to the public view
He never missed going to the early Low Mass quite alone
His family always came later at the ten oclock High Mass
There had been at one time or another a good many members of this family
Two wives had borne Jeremiah Madden a total of over a dozen children
Of these there survived now only two of the first Mrs Maddens offspring Michael and Celiaand a son of the present wife who had been baptized Terence but called himself Theodore
This minority of the family inhabited the great new house on Main Street
Jeremiah went every Sunday afternoon by himself to kneel in the presence of the majority there where they lay in Saint Agnes consecrated ground
If the weather was good he generally extended his walk through the fields to an old deserted Catholic burialfield which had been used only in the first years after the famine invasion and now was clean forgotten
The old wagonmaker liked to look over the primitive neglected stones which marked the graves of these earlier exiles
Fully half of the inscriptions mentioned his County Galway there were two naming the very parish adjoining his
The latest date on any stone was of the remoter fifties
They had all been stricken down here in this strange land with its bitter winters while the memory of their own soft humid gentle westcoast air was fresh within them
Musing upon the clumsy sculpture with its RIP or Pray for the Soul of half to be guessed under the stain and moss of a generation there would seem to him but a step from this present to that heartrending awful past
What had happened between was a meaningless vision as impersonal as the passing of the planets overhead
He rarely had an impulse to tears in the new cemetery where his ten children were
He never left this weedgrown forsaken old Godsacre dryeyed
One must not construct from all this the image of a melancholy man as his fellows met and knew him
Mr Madden kept his griefs racial and individual for his own use
To the men about him in the offices and the shops he presented day after day year after year an imperturbable cheeriness of demeanor
He had been always fortunate in the selection of lieutenants and chief helpers
Two of these had grown now into partners and were almost as much a part of the big enterprise as Jeremiah himself
They spoke often of their inability to remember any unjust or petulant word of hismuch less any unworthy deed
Once they had seen him in a great rage all the more impressive because he said next to nothing
A thoughtless fellow told a dirty story in the presence of some apprentices and Madden listening to this drove the offender implacably from his employ
It was years now since any one who knew him had ventured upon lewd pleasantries in his hearing
Jokes of the sort which women might hear he was very fond of though he had not much humor of his own
Of books he knew nothing whatever and he made only the most perfunctory pretence now and again of reading the newspapers
The elder son Michael was very like his fatherdiligent unassuming kindly and simplea plain tall thin red man of nearly thirty who toiled in paper cap and rolledup shirtsleeves as the superintendent in the sawmill and put on no airs whatever as the son of the master
If there was surprise felt at his not being taken into the firm as a partner he gave no hint of sharing it
He attended to his religious duties with great zeal and was President of the Sodality as a matter of course
This was regarded as his blind side and young employees who cultivated it and made broad their phylacteries under his notice certainly had an added chance of getting on well in the works
To some few whom he knew specially well Michael would confess that if he had had the brains for it he should have wished to be a priest
He displayed no inclination to marry
The other son Terence was some eight years younger and seemed the product of a wholly different race
The contrast between Michaels sandy skin and long gaunt visage and this dark boys handsome rounded face with its prettily curling black hair large heavily fringed brown eyes and delicately modelled features was not more obvious than their temperamental separation
This second lad had been away for years at school indeed at a good many schools for no one seemed to manage to keep him long
He had been with the Jesuits at Georgetown with the Christian Brothers at Manhattan the sectarian Mt
St Marys and the severely secular Annapolis had both been tried and proved misfits
The young man was home again now and save that his name had become Theodore he appeared in no wise changed from the beautiful wilful bold and showy boy who had gone away in his teens
He was still rather small for his years but so gracefully moulded in form and so perfectly tailored that the fact seemed rather an advantage than otherwise
He never dreamed of going near the wagonworks but he did go a good dealin fact most of the timeto the Nedahma Club
His mother spoke often to her friends about her fears for his health
He never spoke to his friends about his mother at all
The second Mrs Madden did not indeed appeal strongly to the family pride
She had been a Miss Foley a dressmaker and an old maid
Jeremiah had married her after a brief widowerhood principally because she was the sister of his parish priest and had a considerable reputation for piety
It was at a time when the expansion of his business was promising certain wealth and suggesting the removal to Octavius
He was conscious of a notion that his obligations to social respectability were increasing it was certain that the embarrassments of a motherless family were
Miss Foley had shown a good deal of attention to his little children
She was not illlooking she bore herself with modesty she was the priests sister the niece once removed of a vicargeneral
And so it came about
Although those most concerned did not say so everybody could see from the outset the pity of its ever having come about at all
The pious and stiffly respectable priests sister had been harmless enough as a spinster
It made the heart ache to contemplate her as a wife
Incredibly narrowminded ignorant suspicious vain and sourtempered she must have driven a less equable and wellrooted man than Jeremiah Madden to drink or flight
He may have had his temptations but they made no mark on the even record of his life
He only worked the harder concentrating upon his business those extra hours which another sort of homelife would have claimed instead
The end of twenty years found him a rich man but still toiling pertinaciously day by day as if he had his wage to earn
In the great house which had been built to please or rather placate his wife he kept to himself as much as possible
The popular story of his smoking alone in the kitchen was more or less true only Michael as a rule sat with him too weaklunged for tobacco himself but reading stray scraps from the papers to the lonely old man and talking with him about the works the while Jeremiah meditatively sucked his clay pipe
One or two evenings in the week the twain spent up in Celias part of the house listening with the awe of simple honest mechanics to the music she played for them
Celia was to them something indefinably less indescribably more than a daughter and sister
They could not think there had ever been anything like her before in the world the notion of criticising any deed or word of hers would have appeared to them monstrous and unnatural
She seemed to have come up to this radiant and wise and marvellously talented womanhood of hers to their minds quite spontaneously
There had been a little Celia a redheaded sulky mutinous slip of a girl always at war with her stepmother and affording no special comfort or hope to the rest of the family
Then there was a long gap during which the father four times a year handed Michael a letter he had received from the superioress of a distant convent referring with cold formality to the studies and discipline by which Miss Madden might profit more if she had been better brought up and enclosing a large bill
Then all at once they beheld a big Celia whom they spoke of as being home again but who really seemed never to have been there before a tall handsome confident young woman swift of tongue and apprehension appearing to know everything there was to be known by the most learned able to paint pictures carve wood speak in divers languages and make music for the gods yet with it all a very proud lady one might say a queen
The miracle of such a Celia as this impressed itself even upon the stepmother
Mrs Madden had looked forward with a certain grim tightening of her combative jaws to the homecoming of the redhead
She felt herself much more the fine lady now than she had been when the girl went away
She had her carriage now and the magnificent new house was nearly finished and she had a greater number of ailments and spent far more money on doctors bills than any other lady in the whole section
The flush of pride in her greatest achievement up to datehaving the most celebrated of New York physicians brought up to Octavius by special train still prickled in her blood
It was in all the papers and the admiration of the flatterers and softsawdherers wives of Irish merchants and smaller professional men who formed her social circlewas raising visions in her poor head of going next year with Theodore to Saratoga and fastening the attention of the whole fashionable republic upon the variety and resources of her invalidism
Mrs Maddens fancy did not run to the length of seeing her stepdaughter also at Saratoga it pictured her still as the sullen and hated redhead moping defiantly in corners or courting by her insolence the punishments which leaped against their leash in the stepmothers mind to get at her
The real Celia when she came fairly took Mrs Maddens breath away
The peevish little plans for annoyance and tyranny the resolutions born of ignorant and jealous egotism found themselves swept out of sight by the very first swirl of Celias dresstrain when she came down from her room robed in peacock blue
The stepmother could only stare
Now after two years of it Mrs Madden still viewed her stepdaughter with roundeyed uncertainty not unmixed with wrathful fear
She still drove about behind two magnificent horses the new house had become almost tiresome by familiarity her preeminence in the interested minds of the Dearborn County Medical Society was as towering as ever but somehow it was all different
There was a note of unreality nowadays in Mrs Donnellys professions of wonder at her bearing up under her multiplied maladies there was almost a leer of mockery in the sympathetic smirk with which the Misses Mangan listened to her symptoms
Even the doctors though they kept their faces turned toward her obviously did not pay much attention the people in the street seemed no longer to look at her and her equipage at all
Worst of all something of the meaning of this managed to penetrate her own mind
She caught now and again a dim glimpse of herself as others must have been seeing her for years as a stupid ugly boastful and badtempered old nuisance
And it was always as if she saw this in a mirror held up by Celia
Of open discord there had been next to none
Celia would not permit it and showed this so clearly from the start that there was scarcely need for her saying it
It seemed hardly necessary for her to put into words any of her desires for that matter
All existing arrangements in the Madden household seemed to shrink automatically and make room for her whichever way she walked
A whole quarter of the unfinished house set itself apart for her
Partitions altered themselves doorways moved across to opposite sides a recess opened itself tall and deep for it knew not what statuesimply because it seemed the Lady Celia willed it so
When the family moved into this mansion it was with a consciousness that the only one who really belonged there was Celia
She alone could behave like one perfectly at home
It seemed entirely natural to the others that she should do just what she liked shut them off from her portion of the house take her meals there if she felt disposed and keep such hours as pleased her instant whim
If she awakened them at midnight by her piano or deferred her breakfast to the late afternoon they felt that it must be all right since Celia did it
She had one room furnished with only divans and huge soft cushions its walls covered with large copies of statuary not too strictly clothed which she would suffer no one not even the servants to enter
Michael fancied sometimes when he passed the draped entrance to this sacred chamber that the portiere smelt of tobacco but he would not have spoken of it even had he been sure
Old Jeremiah whose established habit it was to audit minutely the expenses of his household covered over round sums to Celias separate banking account upon the mere playful hint of her holding her checkbook up without a dream of questioning her
That the stepmother had joy or indeed anything but gall and wormwood out of all this is not to be pretended
There lingered along in the recollection of the family some vague memories of her having tried to assert an authority over Celias comings and goings at the outset but they grouped themselves as only parts of the general disorder of moving and settling which a fortnight or so quite righted
Mrs Madden still permitted herself a certain license of hostile comment when her stepdaughter was not present and listened with gratification to what the women of her acquaintance ventured upon saying in the same spirit but actual interference or remonstrance she never offered nowadays
The two rarely met for that matter and exchanged only the baldest and curtest forms of speech
Celia Madden interested all Octavius deeply
This she must have done in any case if only because she was the only daughter of its richest citizen
But the bold luxuriant quality of her beauty the original and piquant freedom of her manners the stories told in gossip about her lawlessness at home her intellectual attainments and artistic vagariesthese were even more exciting
The unlikelihood of her marrying any oneat least any Octavianwas felt to add a certain romantic zest to the image she made on the local perceptions
There was no visible young Irishman at all approaching the social and financial standard of the Maddens it was taken for granted that a mixed marriage was quite out of the question in this case
She seemed to have more business about the church than even the priest
She was always playing the organ or drilling the choir or decorating the altars with flowers or looking over the robes of the acolytes for rents and stains or going in or out of the pastorate
Clearly this was not the sort of girl to take a Protestant husband
The gossip of the town concerning her was however exclusively Protestant
The Irish spoke of her even among themselves but seldom
There was no occasion for them to pretend to like her they did not know her except in the most distant and formal fashion
Even the members of the choir of both sexes had the sense of being held away from her at haughty arms length
No single parishioner dreamed of calling her friend
But when they referred to her it was always with a cautious and respectful reticence
For one thing she was the daughter of their chief man the man they most esteemed and loved
For another reservations they may have had in their souls about her touched close upon a delicately sore spot
It could not escape their notice that their Protestant neighbors were watching her with vigilant curiosity and with a certain tendency to wink when her name came into conversation along with that of Father Forbes
It had never yet got beyond a tendencythe barest fluttering suggestion of a tempted eyelidbut the whole Irish population of the place felt themselves to be waiting with clenched fists but sinking hearts for the wink itself
The Rev
Theron Ware had not caught even the faintest hint of these overtures to suspicion
When he had entered the huge dark cool vault of the church he could see nothing at first but a faint light up over the gallery far at the other end
Then little by little his surroundings shaped themselves out of the gloom
To his right was a rail and some broad steps rising toward a softly confused mass of little gray vertical bars and the pale twinkle of tiny spots of gilded reflection which he made out in the dusk to be the candles and trappings of the altar
Overhead the great arches faded away from foundations of dimly discernible capitals into utter blackness
There was a strange medicinal odor as of cubeb cigarettesin the air
After a little pause he tiptoed noiselessly up the side aisle toward the end of the churchtoward the light above the gallery
This radiance from a single gasjet expanded as he advanced and spread itself upward over a burnished row of monster metal pipes which went towering into the darkness like giants
They were roaring at him now a sonorous deafening angry bellow which made everything about him vibrate
The gallery balustrade hid the keyboard and the organist from view
There were only these jostling brazen tubes as big round as trees and as tall trembling with their own furious thunder
It was for all the world as if he had wandered into some vast tragical enchanted cave and was being drawn against his will like fascinated bird and pythontoward fate at the savage hands of these swollen and enraged genii
He stumbled in the obscure light over a kneelingbench making a considerable racket
On the instant the noise from the organ ceased and he saw the black figure of a woman rise above the galleryrail and look down
Who is it
the indubitable voice of Miss Madden demanded sharply
Theron had a sudden sheepish notion of turning and running
With the best grace he could summon he called out an explanation instead
Wait a minute
Im through now
Im coming down she returned
He thought there was a note of amusement in her tone
She came to him a moment later accompanied by a thin tall man whom Theron could barely see in the dark now that the organlight too was gone
This man lighted a match or two to enable them to make their way out
When they were on the sidewalk Celia spoke Walk on ahead Michael
she said
I have some matters to speak of with Mr
Ware
CHAPTER X Well what did you think of Dr
Ledsmar
The girls abrupt question came as a relief to Theron
They were walking along in a darkness so nearly complete that he could see next to nothing of his companion
For some reason this seemed to suggest a sort of impropriety
He had listened to the footsteps of the man ahead whom he guessed to be a servantand pictured him as intent upon getting up early next morning to tell everybody that the Methodist minister had stolen into the Catholic church at night to walk home with Miss Madden
That was going to be very awkwardyes worse than awkward
It might mean ruin itself
She had mentioned aloud that she had matters to talk over with him that of course implied confidences and the man might put heaven only knew what construction on that
It was notorious that servants did ascribe the very worst motives to those they worked for
The bare thought of the delight an Irish servant would have in also dragging a Protestant clergyman into the thing was sickening
And what could she want to talk to him about anyway
The minute of silence stretched itself out upon his nerves into an interminable period of anxious unhappiness
Her mention of the doctor at last somehow seemed to lighten the situation
Oh I thought he was very smart
he made haste to answer
Wouldnt it be bettertokeep close to your man
Hemaythink weve gone some other way
It wouldnt matter if he did remarked Celia
She appeared to comprehend his nervousness and take pity on it for she added It is my brother Michael as good a soul as ever lived
He is quite used to my ways
The Rev
Mr Ware drew a long comforting breath
Oh I see
He went with you tobring you home
To blow the organ said the girl in the dark correctingly
But about that doctor did you like him
Well Theron began like is rather a strong word for so short an acquaintance
He talked very well that is fluently
But he is so different from any other man I have come into contact with that What I wanted you to say was that you hated him put in Celia firmly
I dont make a practice of saying that of anybody returned Theron so much at his ease again that he put an effect of gentle smiling reproof into the words
And why specially should I make an exception for him
Because hes a beast
Theron fancied that he understood
I noticed that he seemed not to have much of an ear for music he commented with a little laugh
He shut down the window when you began to play
His doing so annoyed me because I I wanted very much to hear it all
I never heard such music before
II came into the church to hear more of it but then you stopped
I will play for you some other time Celia said answering the reproach in his tone
But tonight I wanted to talk with you instead
She kept silent in spite of this so long now that Theron was on the point of jestingly asking when the talk was to begin
Then she put a question abruptly It is a conventional way of putting it but are you fond of poetry Mr
Ware
Well yes I suppose I am replied Theron much mystified
I cant say that I am any great judge but I like the things that I likeand Meredith interposed Celia makes one of his women Emilia in England say that poetry is like talking on tiptoe like animals in cages always going to one end and back again
Does it impress you that way
I dont know that it does said he dubiously
It seemed however to be her whim to talk literature and he went on Ive hardly read Meredith at all
I once borrowed his Lucile but somehow I never got interested in it
I heard a recitation of his once though a piece about a dead wife and the husband and another man quarrelling as to whose portrait was in the locket on her neck and of their going up to settle the dispute and finding that it was the likeness of a third man a young priestand though it was very striking it didnt give me a thirst to know his other poems
I fancied I shouldnt like them
But I daresay I was wrong
As I get older I find that I take less narrow views of literaturethat is of course of light literature and thatthat Celia mercifully stopped him
The reason I asked you was she began and then herself paused
Or no never mind thattell me something else
Are you fond of pictures statuary the beautiful things of the world
Do great works of art the big achievements of the big artists appeal to you stir you up
Alas
that is something I can only guess at myself answered Theron humbly
I have always lived in little places
I suppose from your point of view I have never seen a good painting in my life
I can only say this thoughthat it has always weighed on my mind as a great and sore deprivation this being shut out from knowing what others mean when they talk and write about art
Perhaps that may help you to get at what you are after
If I ever went to New York I feel that one of the first things I should do would be to see all the picture galleries is that what you meant
Andwould you mind telling me why you
Why I asked you
Celia supplied his halting question
No I DONT mind
I have a reason for wanting to know to satisfy myself whether I had guessed rightly or not about the kind of man you are
I mean in the matter of temperament and bent of mind and tastes
The girl seemed to be speaking seriously and without intent to offend
Theron did not find any comment ready but walked along by her side wondering much what it was all about
I daresay you think me too familiar on short acquaintance she continued after a little
My dear Miss Madden
he protested perfunctorily
No it is a matter of a good deal of importance she went on
I can see that you are going to be thrown into friendship close contact with Father Forbes
He likes you and you cant help liking him
There is nobody else in this raw overgrown emptyheaded place for you and him TO like nobody except that man that Dr Ledsmar
And if you like HIM I shall hate you
He has done mischief enough already
I am counting on you to help undo it and to choke him off from doing more
It would be different if you were an ordinary Orthodox minister all encased like a terrapin in prejudices and nonsense
Of course if you had been THAT kind we should never have got to know you at all
But when I saw you in MacEvoys cottage there it was plain that you were one of US I mean a MAN and not a marionette or a mummy
I am talking very frankly to you you see
I want you on my side against that doctor and his heartless bloodless science
I feel myself very heartily on your side replied Theron
She had set their progress at a slower pace now that the lights of the main street were drawing near as if to prolong their talk
All his earlier reservations had fled
It was almost as if she were a parishioner of his own
I need hardly tell you that the doctors whole attitude towardtoward revelationwas deeply repugnant to me
It doesnt make it any the less hateful to call it science
I am afraid though he went on hesitatingly that there are difficulties in the way of my helping as you call it
You see the very fact of my being a Methodist minister and his being a Catholic priest rather puts my interference out of the question
No that doesnt matter a button said Celia lightly
None of us think of that at all
There is the other embarrassment then pursued Theron diffidently that Father Forbes is a vastly broader and deeper scholarin all these mattersthan I am
How could I possibly hope to influence him by my poor arguments
I dont know even the alphabet of the language he thinks in on these subjects I mean
Of course you dont
interposed the girl with a confidence which the other for all his meekness rather winced under
That wasnt what I meant at all
We dont want arguments from our friends we want sympathies sensibilities emotional bonds
The right persons silence is worth more for companionship than the wisest talk in the world from anybody else
It isnt your mind that is needed here or what you know it is your heart and what you feel
You are full of poetry of ideals of generous unselfish impulses
You see the human the warmblooded side of things
THAT is what is really valuable
THAT is how you can help
You overestimate me sadly protested Theron though with considerable tolerance for her error in his tone
But you ought to tell me something about this Dr Ledsmar
He spoke of being an old friend of the prof Father Forbes
Oh yes theyve always known each other that is for many years
They were professors together in a college once heaven only knows how long ago
Then they separated I fancy they quarrelled too before they parted
The doctor came here where some relative had left him the place he lives in
Then in time the Bishop chanced to send Father Forbes herethat was about three years ago and the two men after a while renewed their old relations
They dine together that is the doctors stronghold
He knows more about eating than any other man alive I believe
He studies it as you would study a language
He has taught old Maggie at the pastorate there to cook like the mother of all the Delmonicos
And while they sit and stuff themselves or loll about afterward like gorged snakes they think it is smart to laugh at all the sweet and beautiful things in life and to sneer at people who believe in ideals and to talk about mankind being merely a fortuitous product of fermentation and twaddle of that sort
It makes me sick
I can readily see said Theron with sympathy how such a cold material and infidel influence as that must shock and revolt an essentially religious temperament like yours
Miss Madden looked up at him
They had turned into the main street and there was light enough for him to detect something startlingly like a grin on her beautiful face
But Im not religious at all you know he heard her say
Im as Pagan asanything
Of course there are forms to be observed and so on I rather like them than otherwise
I can make them serve very well for my own system for I am myself you know an outanout Greek
Why I had supposed that you were full blooded Irish the Rev
Mr Ware found himself remarking and then on the instant was overwhelmed by the consciousness that he had said a foolish thing
Precisely where the folly lay he did not know but it was impossible to mistake the gesture of annoyance which his companion had instinctively made at his words
She had widened the distance between them now and quickened her step
They went on in silence till they were within a block of her house
Several people had passed them who Theron felt sure must have recognized them both
What I meant was the girl all at once began drawing nearer again and speaking with patient slowness that I find myself much more in sympathy with the Greek thought the Greek theology of the beautiful and the strong the Greek philosophy of life and all that than what is taught nowadays
Personally I take much more stock in Plato than I do in Peter
But of course it is a wholly personal affair I had no business to bother you with it
And for that matter I oughtnt to have troubled you with any of our I assure you Miss Madden
the young minister began with fervor
No she broke in in a resigned and even downcast tone let it all be as if I hadnt spoken
Dont mind anything I have said
If it is to be it will be
You cant say more than that can you
She looked into his face again and her large eyes produced an impression of deep melancholy which Theron found himself somehow impelled to share
Things seemed all at once to have become very sad indeed
It is one of my unhappy nights she explained in gloomy confidence
I get them every once in a while as if some vicious planet or other was crossing in front of my good starand then Im a caution to snakes
I shut myself upthats the only thing to doand have it out with myself I didnt know but the organmusic would calm me down but it hasnt
I shant sleep a wink tonight but just rage around from one room to another piling all the cushions from the divans on to the floor and then kicking them away again
Do YOU ever have fits like that
Theron was able to reply with a good conscience in the negative
It occurred to him to add with jocose intent I am curious to know do these fits as you call them occupy a prominent part in Grecian philosophy as a general rule
Celia gave a little snort which might have signified amusement but did not speak until they were upon her own sidewalk
There is my brother waiting at the gate she said then briefly
Well then I will bid you goodnight here I think Theron remarked coming to a halt and offering his hand
It must be getting very late and mythat isI have to be up particularly early tomorrow
So goodnight I hope you will be feeling ever so much better in spirits in the morning
Oh that doesnt matter replied the girl listlessly
Its a very paltry little affair this life of ours at the best of it
Luckily its soon done with like a bad dream
Tut
Tut
I wont have you talk like that
interrupted Theron with a swift and smart assumption of authority
Such talk isnt sensible and it isnt good
I have no patience with it
Well try and have a little patience with ME anyway just for tonight said Celia taking the reproof with gentlest humility rather to her censors surprise
I really am unhappy tonight Mr Ware very unhappy
It seems as if all at once the world had swelled out in size a thousandfold and that poor me had dwindled down to the merest wee little redheaded atomthe most helpless and forlorn and lonesome of atoms at that
She seemed to force a sorrowful smile on her face as she added But all the same it has done me good to be with you I am sure it hasand I daresay that by tomorrow I shall be quite out of the blues
Goodnight Mr Ware
Forgive my making such an exhibition of myself I WAS going to be such a fine early Greek you know and I have turned out only a late Milesianquite of the decadence
I shall do better next time
And goodnight again and ever so many thanks
She was walking briskly away toward the gate now where the shadowy Michael still patiently stood
Theron strode off in the opposite direction taking long deliberate steps and bowing his head in thought
He had his hands behind his back as was his wont and the sense of their recent contact with her firm ungloved hands was curiously enough the thing which pushed itself uppermost in his mind
There had been a frank almost manly vigor in her grasp he said to himself that of course that came from her playing so much on the keyboard the exercise naturally would give her large robust hands
Suddenly he remembered about the piano he had quite forgotten to solicit her aid in selecting it
He turned upon the impulse to go back
She had not entered the gate as yet but stood shiningly visible under the street lamp on the sidewalk and she was looking in his direction
He turned again like a shot and started homeward
The front door of the parsonage was unlocked and he made his way on tiptoe through the unlighted hall to the livingroom
The stuffy air here was almost suffocating with the evil smell of a kerosene lamp turned down too low
Alice sat asleep in her old farmhouse rockingchair with an inelegant darningbasket on the table by her side
The whole effect of the room was as bare and squalid to Therons newly informed eye as the atmosphere was offensive to his nostrils
He coughed sharply and his wife sat up and looked at the clock
It was after eleven
Where on earth have you been
she asked with a yawn turning up the wick of her sewinglamp again
You ought never to turn down a light like that said Theron with a complaining note in his voice
It smells up the whole place
I never dreamed of your sitting up for me like this
You ought to have gone to bed
But how could I guess that you were going to be so late she retorted
And you havent told me where you were
Is this book of yours going to keep you up like this right along
The episode of the book was buried in the young ministers mind beneath such a mass of subsequent experiences that it required an effort for him to grasp what she was talking about
It seemed as if months had elapsed since he was in earnest about that book and yet he had left the house full of it only a few hours before
He shook his wits together and made answer Oh bless you no
Only there arose a very curious question
You have no idea literally no conception of the interesting and important problems which are raised by the mere fact of Abraham leaving the city of Ur
Its amazing I assure you
I hadnt realized it myself
Well remarked Alice risingand with goodhumor and petulance struggling sleepily ill her toneall Ive got to say is that if Abraham hasnt anything better to do than to keep young ministers of the gospel out goodness knows where till all hours of the night I wish to gracious hed stayed in the city of Ur right straight along
You have no idea what a scholarly man Dr Ledsmar is Theron suddenly found himself inspired to volunteer
He has the most marvellous collection of booksa whole library devoted to this very subjectand he has put them all quite freely at my disposal
Extremely kind of him isnt it
Ledsmar
Ledsmar
queried Alice
I dont seem to remember the name
He isnt the little man with the birthmark who sits in the pew behind the Lovejoys is he
I think some one said he was a doctor
Yes a horse doctor
said Theron with a sniff
No you havent seen this Dr Ledsmar at all
II dont know that he attends any church regularly
I scraped his acquaintance quite by accident
He is really a character
He lives in the big house just beyond the racecourse you knowthe one with the tower at the back No I dont know
How should I
Ive hardly poked my nose outside of the yard since I have been here
Well you shall go said the husband consolingly
You HAVE been cooped up here too much poor girl
I must take you out more really
I dont know that I could take you to the doctors placewithout an invitation I mean
He is very queer about some things
He lives there all alone for instance with only a Chinaman for a servant
He told me I was almost the only man he had asked under his roof for years
He isnt a practising physician at all you know
He is a scientist he makes experiments with lizards and things
Theron the wife said pausing lamp in hand on her way to the bedroom do you be careful now
For all you know this doctor may be a loose man or pretty near an infidel
Youve got to be mighty particular in such matters you know or youll have the trustees down on you like a thousand of bricks
I will thank the trustees to mind their own business said Theron stiffly and the subject dropped
The bedroom window upstairs was open and upon the fresh night air was borne in the shrill jangling sound of a piano being played off somewhere in the distance but so vehemently that the noise imposed itself upon the silence far and wide
Theron listened to this as he undressed
It proceeded from the direction of the main street and he knew as by instinct that it was the Madden girl who was playing
The incongruity of the hour escaped his notice
He mused instead upon the wild and tropical tangle of moods emotions passions which had grown up in that strange temperament
He found something very pathetic in that picture she had drawn of herself in forecast roaming disconsolate through her rooms the livelong night unable to sleep
The woful moan of insomnia seemed to make itself heard in every strain from her piano
Alice heard it also but being unillumined she missed the romantic pathos
I call it disgraceful she muttered from her pillow for folks to be banging away on a piano at this time of night
There ought to be a law to prevent it
It may be some distressed soul said Theron gently seeking relief from the curse of sleeplessness
The wife laughed almost contemptuously
Distressed fiddlesticks
was her only other comment
The music went on for a long timerising now to strident heights now sinking off to the merest tinkling murmur and broken ever and again by intervals of utter hush
It did not prevent Alice from at once falling sound asleep but Theron lay awake it seemed to him for hours listening tranquilly and letting his mind wander at will through the pleasant antechambers of Sleep where are more unreal fantasies than Dreamland itself affords
PART II CHAPTER XI For some weeks the Rev
Theron Ware saw nothing of either the priest or the doctor or the interesting Miss Madden
There were indeed more urgent matters to think about
June had come and every succeeding day brought closer to hand the ordeal of his first Quarterly Conference in Octavius
The waters grew distinctly rougher as his pastoral bark neared this difficult passage
He would have approached the great event with an easier mind if he could have made out just how he stood with his congregation
Unfortunately nothing in his previous experiences helped him in the least to measure or guess at the feelings of these curious Octavians
Their Methodism seemed to be sound enough and to stick quite to the letter of the Discipline so long as it was expressed in formulae
It was its spirit which he felt to be complicated by all sorts of conditions wholly novel to him
The existence of a line of streetcars in the town for example would not impress the casual thinker as likely to prove a rock in the path of peaceful religion
Theron in his simplicity had even thought when he first saw these bobtailed cars bumping along the rails in the middle of the main street that they must be a great convenience to people living in the outskirts who wished to get in to church of a Sunday morning
He was imprudent enough to mention this in conversation with one of his new parishioners
Then he learned to his considerable chagrin that when this line was built some years before a bitter war of words had been fought upon the question of its being worked on the Sabbath day
The then occupant of the Methodist pulpit had so distinguished himself above the rest by the solemnity and fervor of his protests against this insolent desecration of Gods day that the Methodists of Octavius still felt themselves peculiarly bound to hold this horsecar line its management and everything connected with it in unbending aversion
At least once a year they were accustomed to expect a sermon denouncing it and all its impious Sunday patrons
Theron made a mental resolve that this year they should be disappointed
Another burning problem which he had not been called upon before to confront he found now entangled with the mysterious line which divided a circus from a menagerie
Those itinerant tentshows had never come his way heretofore and he knew nothing of that fine balancing proportion between ladies in tights on horseback and cages full of deeply educational animals which even as the impartial rain was designed to embrace alike the just and the unjust
There had arisen inside the Methodist society of Octavius some painful episodes connected with members who took their children just to see the animals and were convicted of having also watched the RoseQueen of the Arena in her unequalled flying leap through eight hoops with an ardent and unashamed eye
One of these cases still remained on the censorial docket of the church and Theron understood that he was expected to name a committee of five to examine and try it
This he neglected to do
He was no longer at all certain that the congregation as a whole liked his sermons
The truth was no doubt that he had learned enough to cease regarding the congregation as a whole
He could still rely upon carrying along with him in his discourses from the pulpit a large majority of interested and approving faces
But here unhappily was a case where the majority did not rule
The minority relatively small in numbers was prodigious in virile force
More than twenty years had now elapsed since that minor schism in the Methodist Episcopal Church the result of which was the independent body known as Free Methodists had relieved the parent flock of its principal disturbing element
The rupture came fittingly at that time when all the isms of the argumentative fifties were hurled violently together into the meltingpot of civil war
The great Methodist Church South had broken bodily off on the question of State Rights
The smaller and domestic fraction of Free Methodism separated itself upon an issue which may be most readily described as one of civilization
The seceders resented growth in material prosperity they repudiated the introduction of written sermons and organmusic they deplored the increasing laxity in meddlesome piety the introduction of polite manners in the pulpit and classroom and the development of even a rudimentary desire among the younger people of the church to be like others outside in dress and speech and deportment
They did battle as long as they could inside the fold to restore it to the severely straight and narrow path of primitive Methodism
When the adverse odds became too strong for them they quitted the church and set up a Bethel for themselves
Octavius chanced to be one of the places where they were able to hold their own within the church organization
The Methodism of the town had gone along without any local secession
It still held in full fellowship the radicals who elsewhere had followed their unbridled bent into the strongest emotional vagarieswhere excited brethren worked themselves up into epileptic fits and women whirled themselves about in weird religious ecstasies like dervishes of the Orient till they fell headlong in a state of trance
Octavian Methodism was spared extravagances of this sort it is true but it paid a price for the immunity
The people whom an open split would have taken away remained to leaven and dominate the whole lump
This small advanced section with its men of a type all the more aggressive from its narrowness and women who went about solemnly in plain gray garments with tightfitting unadorned mousecolored sunbonnets had not been able wholly to enforce its views upon the social life of the church members but of its controlling influence upon their official and public actions there could be no doubt
The situation had begun to unfold itself to Theron from the outset
He had recognized the episodes of the forbidden Sunday milk and of the flowers in poor Alices bonnet as typical of much more that was to come
No week followed without bringing some new fulfilment of this foreboding
Now at the end of two months he knew well enough that the hitherto dominant minority was hostile to him and his ministry and would do whatever it could against him
Though Theron at once decided to show fight and did not at all waver in that resolve his courage was in the main of a despondent sort
Sometimes it would flutter up to the point of confidence or at least hopefulness when he met with substantial men of the church who obviously liked him and whom he found himself mentally ranging on his side in the struggle which was to come
But more often it was blankly apparent to him that the moment flags were flying and drums on the roll these amiable fairweather friends would probably take to their heels
Still such as they were his sole hope lay in their support
He must make the best of them
He set himself doggedly to the task of gathering together all those who were not his enemies into what when the proper time came should be known as the pastors party
There was plenty of apostolic warrant for this
If there had not been Theron felt that the mere elementary demands of selfdefence would have justified his use of strategy
The institution of pastoral calling particularly that inquisitorial form of it laid down in the Discipline had never attracted Theron
He and Alice had gone about among their previous flocks in quite a haphazard fashion without thought of system much less of deliberate purpose
Theron made lists now and devoted thought and examination to the personal tastes and characteristics of the people to be cultivated
There were some for example who would expect him to talk pretty much as the Discipline ordained that is to ask if they had family prayer to inquire after their souls and generally to minister grace to his hearersand these in turn subdivided themselves into classes ranging from those who would wish nothing else to those who needed only a mild spiritual flavor
There were others whom he would please much better by not talking shop at all
Although he could ill afford it he subscribed now for a daily paper that he might have a perpetually renewed source of good conversational topics for these more worldly calls
He also bought several pounds of candy pleasing in color but warranted to be entirely harmless and he made a large mysterious mark on the inside of his new silk hat to remind him not to go out calling without some of this in his pocket for the children
Alice he felt was not helping him in this matter as effectively as he could have wished
Her attitude toward the church in Octavius might best be described by the word sulky
Great allowance was to be made he realized for her humiliation over the flowers in her bonnet
That might justify her fairly enough in being kept away from meeting now and again by headaches or undefined megrims
But it ought not to prevent her from going about and making friends among the kindlier parishioners who would welcome such a thing and whom he from time to time indicated to her
She did go to some extent it is true but she produced in doing so an effect of performing a duty
He did not find traces anywhere of her having created a brilliant social impression
When they went out together he was peculiarly conscious of having to do the work unaided
This was not at all like the Alice of former years of other charges
Why she had been beyond comparison the most popular young woman in Tyre
What possessed her to mope like this in Octavius
Theron looked at her attentively nowadays when she was unaware of his gaze to try if her face offered any answer to the riddle
It could not be suggested that she was ill Never in her life had she been looking so well
She had thrown herself all at once and with what was to him an unaccountable energy into the creation and management of a flowergarden
She was out the better part of every day rain or shine digging transplanting pruning pottering generally about among her plants and shrubs
This work in the open air had given her an aspect of physical wellbeing which it was impossible to be mistaken about
Her husband was glad of course that she had found some occupation which at once pleased her and so obviously conduced to health
This was so much a matter of course in fact that he said to himself over and over again that he was glad
Onlyonly sometimes the thought WOULD force itself upon his attention that if she did not spend so much of her time in her own garden she would have more time to devote to winning friends for them in the Garden of the Lordfriends whom they were going to need badly
The young minister in taking anxious stock of the chances for and against him turned over often in his mind the fact that he had already won rank as a pulpit orator
His sermons had attracted almost universal attention at Tyre and his achievement before the Conference at Tecumseh if it did fail to receive practical reward had admittedly distanced all the other preaching there
It was a part of the evil luck pursuing him that here in this perversely enigmatic Octavius his special gift seemed to be of no use whatever
There were times indeed when he was tempted to think that bad preaching was what Octavius wanted
Somewhere he had heard of a Presbyterian minister in charge of a big city church who managed to keep well in with a watchfully Orthodox congregation and at the same time establish himself in the affections of the community at large by simply preaching two kinds of sermons
In the morning when almost all who attended were his own communicants he gave them very cautious and edifying doctrinal discourses treading loyally in the path of the Westminster Confession
To the evening assemblages made up for the larger part of outsiders he addressed broadly liberal sermons literary in form and full of respectful allusions to modern science and the philosophy of the day
Thus he filled the church at both services and put money in its treasury and his own fame before the world
There was of course the obvious danger that the pious elders who in the forenoon heard infant damnation vigorously proclaimed would revolt when they heard after supper that there was some doubt about even adults being damned at all
But either because the same people did not attend both services or because the ministers perfect regularity in the morning was each week regarded as a retraction of his latest vagaries of an evening no trouble ever came
Theron had somewhat tentatively tried this on in Octavius
It was no good
His parishioners were of the sort who would have come to church eight times a day on Sunday instead of two if occasion offered
The hope that even a portion of them would stop away and that their places would be taken in the evening by less prejudiced strangers who wished for intellectual rather than theological food fell by the wayside
The yearnedfor strangers did not come the familiar faces of the morning service all turned up in their accustomed places every evening
They were faces which confused and disheartened Theron in the daytime
Under the gaslight they seemed even harder and more unsympathetic
He timorously experimented with them for an evening or two then abandoned the effort
Once there had seemed the beginning of a chance
The richest banker in Octaviusa fat sensual hogfaced old bachelor surprised everybody one evening by entering the church and taking a seat
Theron happened to know who he was even if he had not known the suppressed excitement visible in the congregation the way the sisters turned round to look the way the more important brethren put their heads together and exchanged furtive whispers would have warned him that big game was in view
He recalled afterward with something like selfdisgust the eager almost tremulous pains he himself took to please this banker
There was a part of the sermon as it had been written out which might easily give offence to a single man of wealth and free notions of life
With the alertness of a mental gymnast Theron ran ahead excised this portion and had ready when the gap was reached some very pretty general remarks all the more effective and eloquent he felt for having been extemporized
People said it was a good sermon and after the benediction and dispersion some of the officials and principal pewholders remained to talk over the likelihood of a capture having been effected
Theron did not get away without having this mentioned to him and he was conscious of sharing deeply the hope of the brethrenwith the added reflection that it would be a personal triumph for himself into the bargain
He was ashamed of this feeling a little later and of his trick with the sermon
But this chastening product of introspection was all the fruit which the incident bore
The banker never came again
Theron returned one afternoon a little earlier than usual from a group of pastoral calls
Alice who was plucking weeds in a border at the shady side of the house heard his step and rose from her labors
He was walking slowly and seemed weary
He took off his high hat as he saw her and wiped his brow
The broiling June sun was still high overhead
Doubtless it was its insufferable heat which was accountable for the worn lines in his face and the spiritless air which the wifes eye detected
She went to the gate and kissed him as he entered
I believe if I were you she said Id carry an umbrella such scorching days as this
Nobodyd think anything of it
I dont see why a minister shouldnt carry one as much as a woman carries a parasol
Theron gave her a rueful meditative sort of smile
I suppose people really do think of us as a kind of hybrid female he remarked
Then holding his hat in his hand he drew a long breath of relief at finding himself in the shade and looked about him
Why youve got more posies here on this one side of the house alone than mother had in her whole yard he said after a little
Lets seeI know that one thats columbine isnt it
And thats London pride and thats ragged robin
I dont know any of the others
Alice recited various unfamiliar names as she pointed out the several plants which bore them and he listened with a kindly semblance of interest
They strolled thus to the rear of the house where thick clumps of fragrant pinks lined both sides of the path
She picked some of these for him and gave him more names with which to label the considerable number of other plants he saw about him
I had no idea we were so well provided as all this he commented at last
Those Van Sizers must have been tremendous hands for flowers
You were lucky in following such people
Van Sizers
echoed Alice with contempt
All they left was old tomato cans and clamshells
Why Ive put in every blessed one of these myself all except those peonies there and one brier on the side wall
Good for you
exclaimed Theron approvingly
Then it occurred to him to ask But where did you get them all
Around among our friends
Some few responded Alice with a note of hesitation in her voice
Sister Bult gave me the verbenas there and the white pinks were a present from Miss Stevens
But most of them Levi Gorringe was good enough to send me from his garden
I didnt know that Gorringe had a garden said Theron
I thought he lived over his lawoffice in the brick block there
Well I dont know that its exactly HIS explained Alice but its a big garden somewhere outside where he can have anything he likes
She went on with a little laugh I didnt like to question him too closely for fear hed think I was looking a gift horse in the mouthor else hinting for more
It was quite his own offer you know
He picked them all out for me and brought them here and lent me a book telling me just what to do with each one
And in a few days now I am to have another big batch of plantsdahlias and zinnias and asters and so on Im almost ashamed to take them
But its such a change to find some one in this Octavius who isnt all self
Yes Gorringe is a good fellow said Theron
I wish he was a professing member
Then some new thought struck him
Alice he exclaimed I believe Ill go and see him this very afternoon
I dont know why it hasnt occurred to me before hes just the man whose advice I need most
He knows these people here he can tell me what to do
Arent you too tired now
suggested Alice as Theron put on his hat
No the sooner the better he replied moving now toward the gate
Well she began if I were you I wouldnt say too much aboutthat is Ibut never mind
What is it
asked her husband
Nothing whatever replied Alice positively
It was only some nonsense of mine and Theron placidly accepting the feminine whim went off down the street again
CHAPTER XII The Rev
Mr Ware found Levi Gorringes lawoffice readily enough but its owner was not in
He probably would be back again though in a quarter of an hour or so the boy said and the minister at once decided to wait
Theron was interested in finding that this officeboy was no other than Harveythe lad who brought milk to the parsonage every morning
He remembered now that he had heard good things of this urchin as to the hard work he did to help his mother the Widow Semple in her struggle to keep a roof over her head and also bad things in that he did not come regularly either to church or Sundayschool
The clergyman recalled too that Harvey had impressed him as a character
Well sonny are you going to be a lawyer
he asked as he seated himself by the window and looked about him first at the dusty litter of old papers pamphlets and tapebound documents in bundles which crowded the stuffy chamber and then at the boy himself
Harvey was busy at a big boxa rough pine drygoods box which bore the flaring label of an express company and also of a wellknown seed firm in a Western city and which the boy had apparently just opened
He was lifting from it and placing on the table after he had shaken off the sawdust and moss in which they were packed small parcels of what looked in the fading light to be halfdried plants
Well I dont knowI rather guess not he made answer as he pursued his task
So far as I can make out this wouldnt be the place to start in at if I WAS going to be a lawyer
A boy can learn here firstrate how to load cartridges and clean a gun and braid troutflies on to leaders but I dont see much law laying around loose
Anyway he went on I couldnt afford to read law and not be getting any wages
I have to earn money you know
Theron felt that he liked the boy
Yes he said with a kindly tone Ive heard that you are a good industrious youngster
I daresay Mr Gorringe will see to it that you get a chance to read law and get wages too
Oh I can read all there is here and welcome the boy explained stepping toward the window to decipher the label on a bundle of roots in his hand but thats no good unless theres regular practice coming into the office all the while
THATS how you learn to be a lawyer
But Gorringe dont have what I call a practice at all
He just sees men in the other room there with the door shut and whatever there is to do he does it all himself
The minister remembered a stray hint somewhere that Mr Gorringe was a moneylenderwhat was colloquially called a noteshaver
To his rustic sense there was something not quite nice about that occupation
It would be indecorous he felt to encourage further talk about it from the boy
What are you doing there
he inquired to change the subject
Sorting out some plants replied Harvey
I dont know whats got into Gorringe lately
This is the third big box hes had since Ive been herethat is in six weeks besides two baskets full of rosebushes
I dont know what he does with them
He carries them off himself somewhere
Ive had kind of half a notion that hes figurin on getting married
I cant think of anything else that would make a man spend money like waterjust for flowers and bushes
They do get foolish you know when theyve got marriage on the brain
Theron found himself only imperfectly following the theories of the young philosopher
It was his fact that monopolized the ministers attention
But as I understand it he remarked hesitatingly Brother Gorringeor rather Mr Gorringegets all the plants he wants everything he likes from a big garden somewhere outside
I dont know that it is exactly his but I remember hearing something to that effect
The boy slapped the last litter off his hands and as he came to the window shook his head
These dont come from no garden outside he declared
They come from the dealers and he pays solid cash for em
The invoice for this lot alone was thirtyone dollars and sixty cents
There it is on the table
You can see it for yourself Mr Ware did not offer to look
Very likely these are for the garden I was speaking of he said
Of course you cant go on taking plants out of a garden indefinitely without putting others in
I dont know anything about any garden that he takes plants out of answered Harvey and looked meditatively for a minute or two out upon the street below
Then he turned to the minister
Your wifes doing a good deal of gardening this spring I notice he said casually
Youd hardly think it was the same place shes fixed it up so
If she wants any extra hoeing done I can always get off Saturday afternoons
I will remember said Theron
He also looked out of the window and nothing more was said until a few moments later Mr Gorringe himself came in
The lawyer seemed both surprised and pleased at discovering the identity of his visitor with whom he shook hands in almost an excess of cordiality
He spread a large newspaper over the pile of seedling plants on the table pushed the packingbox under the table with his foot and said almost peremptorily to the boy You can go now
Then he turned again to Theron
Well Mr Ware Im glad to see you he repeated and drew up a chair by the window
Things are going all right with you I hope
Theron noted again the waving black hair the dark skin and the carefully trimmed mustache and chintuft which gave the lawyers face a combined effect of romance and smartness
No it was the eyes cool shrewd darkgray eyes which suggested this latter quality
The recollection of having seen one of them wink in deliberate hostility of sarcasm when those other trustees had their backs turned came mercifully at the moment to recall the young minister to his errand
I thought I would drop in and have a chat with you he said getting better under way as he went on
Quarterly Conference is only a fortnight off and I am a good deal at sea about what is going to happen
Im not a church member you know interposed Gorringe
That shuts me out of the Quarterly Conference
Alas yes
said Theron
I wish it didnt
Im afraid Im not going to have any friends to spare there
What are you afraid of
asked the lawyer seeming now to be wholly at his ease again They cant eat you
No they keep me too lean for that responded Theron with a pensive smile
I WAS going to ask you know for an increase of salary or an extra allowance
I dont see how I can go on as it is
The sum fixed by the last Quarterly Conference of the old year and which I am getting now is one hundred dollars less than my predecessor had
That isnt fair and it isnt right
But so far from its looking as if I could get an increase the prospect seems rather that they will make me pay for the gas and that sidewalk
I never recovered more than about half of my moving expenses as you know andand frankly I dont know which way to turn
It keeps me miserable all the while
Thats where youre wrong said Mr Gorringe
If you let things like that worry you youll keep a sore skin all your life
You take my advice and just go ahead your own gait and let other folks do the worrying
They ARE pretty closefisted here for a fact but you can manage to rub along somehow
If you should get into any real difficulties why I guess the lawyer paused to smile in a hesitating significant wayI guess some road out can be found all right
The main thing is dont fret and dont allow your wife to to fret either
He stopped abruptly
Theron nodded in recognition of his amiable tone and the found the nod lengthening itself out into almost a bow as the thought spread through his mind that this had been nothing more nor less than a promise to help him with money if worst came to worst
He looked at Levi Gorringe and said to himself that the intuition of women was wonderful
Alice had picked him out as a friend of theirs merely by seeing him pass the house
Yes he said I am specially anxious to keep my wife from worrying
She was surrounded in her girlhood by a good deal of what relatively we should call luxury and that makes it all the harder for her to be a poor ministers wife
I had quite decided to get her a hired girl come what might but she thinks shed rather get on without one
Her health is better I must admit than it was when we came here
She works out in her garden a great deal and that seems to agree with her
Octavius is a healthy placethats generally admitted replied the lawyer with indifference
He seemed not to be interested in Mrs Wares health but looked intently out through the window at the buildings opposite and drummed with his fingers on the arms of his chair
Theron made haste to revert to his errand
Of course your not being in the Quarterly Conference he said renders certain things impossible
But I didnt know but you might have some knowledge of how matters are going what plans the officials of the church had they seem to have agreed to tell me nothing
Well I HAVE heard this much responded Gorringe
Theyre figuring on getting the Soulsbys here to raise the debt and kind o shake things up generally
I guess thats about as good as settled
Hadnt you heard of it
Not a breath
exclaimed Theron mournfully
Well he added upon reflection Im sorry downright sorry
The debtraiser seems to me about the lowestdown thing we produce
Ive heard of those Soulsbys I think I saw HIM indeed once at Conference but I believe SHE is the head of the firm
Yes she wears the breeches I understand said Gorringe sententiously
I HAD hoped the young minister began with a rueful sigh in fact I felt quite confident at the outset that I could pay off this debt and put the church generally on a new footing by giving extra attention to my pulpit work
It is hardly for me to say it but in other places where I have been my preaching has been ratherrather a feature in the town itself I have always been accustomed to attract to our services a good many nonmembers and that as you know helps tremendously from a money point of view
But somehow that has failed here
I doubt if the average congregations are a whit larger now than they were when I came in April
I know the collections are not
No commented the lawyer slowly youll never do anything in that line in Octavius
You might of course if you were to stay here and work hard at it for five or six years Heaven forbid
groaned Mr Ware
Quite so put in the other
The point is that the Methodists here are a little set by themselves
I dont know that they like one another specially but I do know that they are not what you might call popular with people outside
Now a new preacher at the Presbyterian church or even the Baptist he might have a chance to create talk and make a stir
But Methodistno
People who dont belong wont come near the Methodist church here so long as theres any other place with a roof on it to go to
Give a dog a bad name you know
Well the Methodists here have got a bad name and if you could preach like Henry Ward Beecher himself you wouldnt change it or get folks to come and hear you
I see what you mean Theron responded
Im not particularly surprised myself that Octavius doesnt love us or look to us for intellectual stimulation
I myself leave that pulpit more often than otherwise feeling like a wet ragutterly limp and discouraged
But if you dont mind my speaking of it YOU dont belong and yet YOU come
It was evident that the lawyer did not mind
He spoke freely in reply
Oh yes Ive got into the habit of it
I began going when I first came here andand so it grew to be natural for me to go
Then of course being the only lawyer you have a considerable amount of my business is mixed up in one way or another with your membership you see those are really the things which settle a man in a rut and keep him there
I suppose your people were Methodists said Theron to fill in the pause and that is how you originally started with us
Levi Gorringe shook his head
He leaned back half closed his eyes put his fingertips together and almost smiled as if something in retrospect pleased and moved him
No he said I went to the church first to see a girl who used to go there
It was long before your time
All her family moved away years ago
You wouldnt know any of them
I was younger then and I didnt know as much as I do now
I worshipped the very ground that girl walked on and like a fool I never gave her so much as a hint of it
Looking back now I can see that I might have had her if Id asked her
But I went instead and sat around and looked at her at church and Sundayschool and prayermeetings Thursday nights and classmeetings after the sermon
She was devoted to religion and church work and thinking it would please her I joined the church on probation
Men can fool themselves easier than they can other people
I actually believed at the time that I had experienced religion
I felt myself full of all sorts of awakenings of the soul and so forth
But it was really that girl
You see Im telling you the thing just as it was
I was very happy
I think it was the happiest time of my life
I remember there was a lovefeast while I was on probation and I sat down in front right beside her and we ate the little square chunks of bread and drank the water together and I held one corner of her hymnbook when we stood up and sang
That was the nearest I ever got to her or to full membership in the church
That very next week I think it was we learned that she had got engaged to the ministers son a young man who had just become a minister himself
They got married and went awayand Isomehow I never took up my membership when the six months probation was over
Thats how it was
It is very interesting remarked Theron softly after a little silenceand very full of human nature
Well now you see said the lawyer what I mean when I say that there hasnt been another minister here since that I should have felt like telling this story to
They wouldnt have understood it at all
They would have thought it was blasphemy for me to say straight out that what I took for experiencing religion was really a girl
But you are different
I felt that at once the first time I saw you
In a pulpit or out of it what I like in a human being is that he SHOULD be human
It pleases me beyond measure that you should like me then returned the young minister with frank gratification shining on his face
The world is made all the sweeter and more lovable by thesethese elements of romance
I am not one of those who would wish to see them banished or frowned upon
I dont mind admitting to you that there is a good deal in MethodismI mean the strict practice of its letter which you find here in Octavius that is personally distasteful to me
I read the other day of an English bishop who said boldly publicly that no modern nation could practise the principles laid down in the Sermon on the Mount and survive for twentyfour hours
Ha ha
Thats good
laughed the lawyer
I felt that it was good too pursued Theron
I am getting to see a great many things differently here in Octavius
Our Methodist Discipline is like the Beatitudesvery helpful and beautiful if treated as spiritual suggestion but more or less of a stumblingblock if insisted upon literally
I declare
he added sitting up in his chair I never talked like this to a living soul before in all my life
Your confidences were contagious
The Rev
Mr Ware rose as he spoke and took up his hat
Must you be going
asked the lawyer also rising
Well Im glad I havent shocked you
Come in oftener when you are passing
And if you see anything I can help you in always tell me
The two men shook hands with an emphatic and lingering clasp
I am glad said Theron that you didnt stop coming to church just because you lost the girl
Levi Gorringe answered the ministers pleasantry with a smile which curled his mustache upward and expanded in little wrinkles at the ends of his eyes
No he said jestingly
Im death on collecting debts and I reckon that the church still owes me a girl
Ill have one yet
So with merriment the echoes of which pleasantly accompanied Theron down the stairway the two men parted
CHAPTER XIII Though time lagged in passing with a slowness which seemed born of studied insolence there did arrive at last a day which had something definitive about it to Therons disturbed and restless mind
It was a Thursday and the prayermeeting to be held that evening would be the last before the Quarterly Conference now only four days off
For some reason the young minister found himself dwelling upon this fact and investing it with importance
But yesterday the Quarterly Conference had seemed a long way ahead
Today brought it alarmingly close to hand
He had not heretofore regarded the weekly assemblage for prayer and song as a thing calling for preparation or for any preliminary thought
Now on this Thursday morning he went to his desk after breakfast which was a sign that he wanted the room to himself quite as if he had the task of a weighty sermon before him
He sat at the desk all the forenoon doing no writing it is true but remembering every once in a while when his mind turned aside from the book in his hands that there was that prayermeeting in the evening
Sometimes he reached the point of vaguely wondering why this strictly commonplace affair should be forcing itself thus upon his attention
Then with a kind of mental shiver at the recollection that this was Thursday and that the great struggle came on Monday he would go back to his book
There were a halfdozen volumes on the open desk before him
He had taken them out from beneath a pile of old SundaySchool Advocates and church magazines where they had lain hidden from Alices view most of the week
If there had been a locked drawer in the house he would have used it instead to hold these books which had come to him in a neat parcel which also contained an amiable note from Dr Ledsmar recalling a pleasant evening in May and expressing the hope that the accompanying works would be of some service
Theron had glanced at the backs of the uppermost two and discovered that their author was Renan
Then he had hastily put the lot in the best place he could think of to escape his wifes observation
He realized now that there had been no need for this secrecy
Of the other four books by Sayce Budge Smith and Lenormant three indeed revealed themselves to be published under religious auspices
As for Renan he might have known that the name would be meaningless to Alice
The feeling that he himself was not much wiser in this matter than his wife may have led him to pass over the learned textbooks on Chaldean antiquity and even the volume of Renan which appeared to be devoted to Oriental inscriptions and take up his other book entitled in the translation Recollections of my Youth
This he rather glanced through at the outset following with a certain inattention the introductory sketches and essays which dealt with an unfamiliar and to his notion somewhat preposterous Breton racial type
Then little by little it dawned upon him that there was a connected story in all this and suddenly he came upon it out in the open as it were
It was the story of how a deeply devout young man trained from his earliest boyhood for the sacred office and desiring passionately nothing but to be worthy of it came to a point where at infinite cost of pain to himself and of anguish to those dearest to him he had to declare that he could no longer believe at all in revealed religion
Theron Ware read this all with an excited interest which no book had ever stirred in him before
Much of it he read over and over again to make sure that he penetrated everywhere the husk of French habits of thought and Catholic methods in which the kernel was wrapped
He broke off midway in this part of the book to go out to the kitchen to dinner and began the meal in silence
To Alices questions he replied briefly that he was preparing himself for the evenings prayermeeting
She lifted her brows in such frank surprise at this that he made a further and somewhat rambling explanation about having again taken up the work on his bookthe book about Abraham
I thought you said youd given that up altogether she remarked
Well he said I WAS discouraged about it for a while
But a man never does anything big without getting discouraged over and over again while hes doing it
I dont say now that I shall write precisely THAT book Im merely reading scientific works about the period just nowbut if not that I shall write some other book
Else how will you get that piano
he added with an attempt at a smile
I thought you had given that up too
she replied ruefully
Then before he could speak she went on Never mind the piano that can wait
What Ive got on my mind just now isnt piano its potatoes
Do you know I saw some the other day at Rasbachs splendid potatoes these are some of themand fifteen cents a bushel cheaper than those driedup old things Brother Barnum keeps and so I bought two bushels
And Sister Barnum met me on the street this morning and threw it in my face that the Discipline commands us to trade with each other
Is there any such command
Yes said the husband
Its Section 33
Dont you remember
I looked it up in Tyre
We are to evidence our desire of salvation by doing good especially to them that are of the household of faith or groaning so to be by employing them preferably to others buying one of another helping each other in business and so on
Yes its all there
Well I told her I didnt believe it was put in Alice and I said that even if it was there ought to be another section about selling potatoes to their minister for more than theyre worthpotatoes that turn all green when you boil them too
I believe Ill read up that old Discipline myself and see if it hasnt got some things that I can talk back with
The very section before that Number 32 enjoins members against uncharitable or unprofitable conversation particularly speaking evil of magistrates or ministers
Youd have em there I think
Theron had begun cheerfully enough but the careworn preoccupied look returned now to his face
Im sorry if weve fallen out with the Barnums he said
His brotherinlaw Davis the Sundayschool superintendent is a member of the Quarterly Conference you know and Ive been hoping that he was on my side
Ive been taking a good deal of pains to make up to him
He ended with a sigh the pathos of which impressed Alice
If you think it will do any good she volunteered Ill go and call on the Davises this very afternoon
Im sure to find her at homeshes tied hand and foot with that brood of hersand youd better give me some of that candy for them
Theron nodded his approval and thanks and relapsed into silence
When the meal was over he brought out the confectionery to his wife and without a word went back to that remarkable book
When Alice returned toward the close of day to prepare the simple tea which was always laid a halfhour earlier on Thursdays and Sundays she found her husband where she had left him still busy with those new scientific works
She recounted to him some incidents of her call upon Mrs Davis as she took off her hat and put on the big kitchen apronhow pleased Mrs Davis seemed to be how her affection for her sisterinlaw the grocers wife disclosed itself to be not even skindeep how the children leaped upon the candy as if they had never seen any before and how in her belief Mr Davis would be heart and soul on Therons side at the Conference
To her surprise the young minister seemed not at all interested
He hardly looked at her during her narrative but reclined in the easychair with his head thrown back and an abstracted gaze wandering aimlessly about the ceiling
When she avowed her faith in the Sundayschool superintendents loyal partisanship which she did with a pardonable pride in having helped to make it secure her husband even closed his eyes and moved his head with a gesture which plainly bespoke indifference
I expected youd be tickled to death she remarked with evident disappointment
Ive a bad headache he explained after a minutes pause
No wonder
Alice rejoined sympathetically enough but with a note of reproof as well
What can you expect staying cooped up in here all day long poring over those books
People are all the while remarking that you study too much
I tell them of course that youre a great hand for reading and always were but I think myself it would be better if you got out more and took more exercise and saw people
You know lots and slathers more than THEY do now or ever will if you never opened another book
Theron regarded her with an expression which she had never seen on his face before
You dont realize what you are saying he replied slowly
He sighed as he added with increased gravity I am the most ignorant man alive
Alice began a little laugh of wifely incredulity and then let it die away as she recognized that he was really troubled and sad in his mind
She bent over to kiss him lightly on the brow and tiptoed her way out into the kitchen
I believe I will let you make my excuses at the prayermeeting this evening he said all at once as the supper came to an end
He had eaten next to nothing during the meal and had sat in a sort of brownstudy from which Alice kindly forbore to arouse him
I dont knowI hardly feel equal to it
They wont take it amissfor once if you explain to them that II am not at all well
Oh I do hope youre not coming down with anything
Alice had risen too and was gazing at him with a solicitude the tenderness of which at once comforted and in some obscure way jarred on his nerves
Is there anything I can door shall I go for a doctor
Weve got mustard in the house and sennaI think theres some senna left and Jamaica ginger
Theron shook his head wearily at her
Oh nono
he expostulated
It isnt anything that needs drugs or doctors either
Its just mental worry and fatigue thats all
An evenings quiet rest in the big chair and early to bedthat will fix me up all right
But youll read and that will make your head worse said Alice
No I wont read any more he promised her walking slowly into the sittingroom and settling himself in the big chair the while she brought out a pillow from the adjoining best bedroom and adjusted it behind his head
Thats nice
Ill just lie quiet here and perhaps doze a little till you come back
I feel in the mood for the rest it will do me all sorts of good
He closed his eyes and Alice regarding his upturned face anxiously decided that already it looked more at peace than awhile ago
Well I hope youll be better when I get back she said as she began preparations for the evening service
These consisted in combing stiffly back the strands of lightbrown hair which during the day had exuberantly loosened themselves over her temples into something almost like curls in fastening down upon this rebellious hair a plain brownstraw bonnet guiltless of all ornament save a binding ribbon of dull umber hue and in putting on a thin darkgray shawl and a pair of equally subdued lislethread gloves
Thus attired she made a mischievous little grimace of dislike at her puritanical image in the lookingglass over the mantel and then turned to announce her departure
Well Im off she said
Theron opened his eyes to take in this figure of his wife dressed for prayermeeting and then closed them again abruptly
All right he murmured and then he heard the door shut behind her
Although he had been alone all day there seemed to be quite a unique value and quality in this present solitude
He stretched out his legs on the opposite chair and looked lazily about him with the feeling that at last he had secured some leisure and could think undisturbed to his hearts content
There were nearly two hours of unbroken quiet before him and the mere fact of his having stepped aside from the routine of his duty to procure it marked it in his thoughts as a special occasion which ought in the nature of things to yield more than the ordinary harvest of mental profit
Therons musings were broken in upon from time to time by rumbling outbursts of hymnsinging from the church next door
Surely he said to himself there could be no other congregation in the Conference or in all Methodism which sang so badly as these Octavians did
The noise as it came to him now and again divided itself familiarly into a main strain of hard high sharp and tinny female voices with three or four concurrent and clashing branch strains of partsinging by men who did not know how
How well he already knew these voices
Through two wooden walls he could detect the conceited and pushing note of Brother Lovejoy who tried always to drown the rest out and the lifeless unmeasured weight of shrill clamor which Sister Barnum hurled into every chorus half closing her eyes and sticking out her chin as she did so
They drawled their hymns too these people till Theron thought he understood that injunction in the Discipline against singing too slowly
It had puzzled him heretofore now he felt that it must have been meant in prophecy for Octavius
It was impossible not to recall in contrast that other church music he had heard a month before and the whole atmosphere of that other pastoral sitting room from which he had listened to it
The startled and crowded impressions of that strange evening had been lying hidden in his mind all this while driven into a corner by the pressure of more ordinary everyday matters
They came forth now and passed across his brainno longer confusing and distorted but in orderly and intelligible sequence
Their earlier effect had been one of frightened fascination
Now he looked them over calmly as they lifted themselves one by one and found himself not shrinking at all or evading anything but dwelling upon each in turn as a natural and welcome part of the most important experience of his life
The young minister had arrived all at once at this conclusion
He did not question at all the means by which he had reached it
Nothing was clearer to his mind than the conclusion itselfthat his meeting with the priest and the doctor was the turningpoint in his career
They had lifted him bodily out of the slough of ignorance of contact with low minds and sordid narrow things and put him on solid ground
This book he had been reading this gentle tender lovable book which had as much true piety in it as any devotional book he had ever read and yet unlike all devotional books put its foot firmly upon everything which could not be proved in human reason to be truemust be merely one of a thousand which men like Father Forbes and Dr Ledsmar knew by heart
The very thought that he was on the way now to know them too made Theron tremble
The prospect wooed him and he thrilled in response with the wistful and delicate eagerness of a young lover
Somehow the fact that the priest and the doctor were not religious men and that this book which had so impressed and stirred him was nothing more than Renans recital of how he too ceased to be a religious man did not take a form which Theron could look square in the face
It wore the shape instead of a vague premise that there were a great many different kinds of religionsthe past and dead races had multiplied these in their time literally into thousandsand that each no doubt had its central support of truth somewhere for the good men who were in it and that to call one of these divine and condemn all the others was a part fit only for untutored bigots
Renan had formally repudiated Catholicism yet could write in his old age with the deepest filial affection of the Mother Church he had quitted
Father Forbes could talk coolly about the Christmyth without even ceasing to be a priest and apparently a very active and devoted priest
Evidently there was an intellectual world a world of culture and grace of lofty thoughts and the inspiring communion of real knowledge where creeds were not of importance and where men asked one another not Is your soul saved
but Is your mind well furnished
Theron had the sensation of having been invited to become a citizen of this world
The thought so dazzled him that his impulses were dragging him forward to take the new oath of allegiance before he had had time to reflect upon what it was he was abandoning
The droning of the Doxology from the church outside stirred Theron suddenly out of his revery
It had grown quite dark and he rose and lit the gas
Blest be the Tie that Binds they were singing
He paused with hand still in air to listen
That wellworn phrase arrested his attention and gave itself a new meaning
He was bound to those people it was true but he could never again harbor the delusion that the tie between them was blessed
There was vaguely present in his mind the consciousness that other ties were loosening as well
Be that as it might one thing was certain
He had passed definitely beyond pretending to himself that there was anything spiritually in common between him and the Methodist Church of Octavius
The necessity of his keeping up the pretence with others rose on the instant like a looming shadow before his mental vision
He turned away from it and bent his brain to think of something else
The noise of Alice opening the front door came as a pleasant digression
A second later it became clear from the sound of voices that she had brought some one back with her and Theron hastily stretched himself out again in the armchair with his head back in the pillow and his feet on the other chair
He had come mighty near forgetting that he was an invalid and he protected himself the further now by assuming an air of lassitude verging upon prostration
Yes theres a light burning
Its all right he heard Alice say
She entered the room and Therons head was too bad to permit him to turn it and see who her companion was
Theron dear Alice began I knew youd be glad to see HER even if you were out of sorts and I persuaded her just to run in for a minute
Let me introduce you to Sister Soulsby
Sister Soulsbymy husband
The Rev
Mr Ware sat upright with an energetic start and fastened upon the stranger a look which conveyed anything but the satisfaction his wife had been so sure about
It was at the first blush an undisguised scowl and only some fleeting memory of that reflection about needing now to dissemble prevented him from still frowning as he rose to his feet and perfunctorily held out his hand
Delighted Im sure he mumbled
Then looking up he discovered that Sister Soulsby knew he was not delighted and that she seemed not to mind in the least
As your good lady said I just ran in for a moment she remarked shaking his limp hand with a brisk businesslike grasp and dropping it
I hate bothering sick people but as were to be thrown together a good deal this next week or so I thought Id like to lose no time in saying howdy
I wont keep you up now
Your wife has been sweet enough to ask me to move my trunk over here in the morning so that youll see enough of me and to spare
Theron looked falteringly into her face as he strove for words which should sufficiently mask the disgust this intelligence stirred within him
A debtraiser in the town was bad enough
A debtraiser quartered in the very parsonagehe ground his teeth to think of it
Alice read his hesitation aright
Sister Soulsby went to the hotel she hastily put in and Loren Pierce was after her to come and stay at his house and I ventured to tell her that I thought we could make her more comfortable here
She accompanied this by so daring a grimace and nod that her husband woke up to the fact that a point in Conference politics was involved
He squeezed a doubtful smile upon his features
We shall both do our best he said
It was not easy but he forced increasing amiability into his glance and tone
Is Brother Soulsby here too
he asked
The debtraiser shook her headagain the prompt decisive movement so like a busy man of affairs
No she answered
Hes doing supply down on the Hudson this week but hell be here in time for the Sunday morning lovefeast
I always like to come on ahead and see how the land lies
Well goodnight
Your head will be all right in the morning
Precisely what she meant by this assurance Theron did not attempt to guess
He received her adieu noted the masterful manner in which she kissed his wife and watched her pass out into the hall with the feeling uppermost that this was a person who decidedly knew her way about
Much as he was prepared to dislike her and much as he detested the vulgar methods her profession typified he could not deny that she seemed a very capable sort of woman
This mental concession did not prevent his fixing upon Alice when she returned to the room a glance of obvious disapproval
Theron she broke forth to anticipate his reproach I did it for the best
The Pierces would have got her if I hadnt cut in
I thought it would help to have her on our side
And besides I like her
Shes the first sister Ive seen since weve been in this hole thats had a kind word for meoror sympathized with me
Andandif youre going to be offended I shall cry
There were real tears on her lashes ready to make good the threat
Oh I guess I wouldnt said Theron with an approach to his old halfplayful manner
If you like her thats the chief thing
Alice shook her teardrops away
No she replied with a wistful smile the chief thing is to have her like you
Shes as smart as a steel trapthat woman is and if she took the notion I believe she could help get us a better place
CHAPTER XIV The ensuing week went by with a buzz and whirl circling about Theron Wares dizzy consciousness like some huge impalpable teetotum sent spinning under Sister Soulsbys resolute hands
Whenever his vagrant memory recurred to it in after months he began by marvelling and ended with a shudder of repulsion
It was a week crowded with events which seemed to him to shoot past so swiftly that in effect they came all of a heap
He never essayed the task in retrospect of arranging them in their order of sequence
They had however a definite and interdependent chronology which it is worth the while to trace
Mrs Soulsby brought her trunk round to the parsonage bright and early on Friday morning and took up her lodgement in the best bedroom and her headquarters in the house at large with a cheerful and businesslike manner
She desired nothing so much she said as that people should not put themselves out on her account or allow her to get in their way
She appeared to mean this too and to have very good ideas about securing its realization
During both Friday and the following day indeed Theron saw her only at the family meals
There she displayed a hearty relish for all that was set before her which quite won Mrs Wares heart and though she talked rather more than Theron found himself expecting from a woman he could not deny that her conversation was both seemly and entertaining
She had evidently been a great traveller and referred to things she had seen in Savannah or Montreal or Los Angeles in as matteroffact fashion as he could have spoken of a visit to Tecumseh
Theron asked her many questions about these and other faroff cities and her answers were all so pat and showed so keen and clear an eye that he began in spite of himself to think of her with a certain admiration
She in turn plied him with inquiries about the principal pewholders and members of his congregationtheir means their disposition and the measure of their devotion
She put these queries with such intelligence and seemed to assimilate his replies with such an alert understanding that the young minister was spurred to put dashes of character in his descriptions and set forth the idiosyncrasies and distinguishing earmarks of his flock with what he felt afterward might have been too free a tongue
But at the time her fine air of appreciation led him captive
He gossiped about his parishioners as if he enjoyed it
He made a specially happy thumbnail sketch for her of one of his trustees Erastus Winch the loudmouthed ostentatiously jovial and really coldhearted cheesebuyer
She was particularly interested in hearing about this man
The personality of Winch seemed to have impressed her and she brought the talk back to him more than once and prompted Theron to the very threshold of indiscretion in his confidences on the subject
Save at mealtimes Sister Soulsby spent the two days out around among the Methodists of Octavius
She had little or nothing to say about what she thus saw and heard but used it as the basis for still further inquiries
She told more than once however of how she had been pressed here or there to stay to dinner or supper and how she had excused herself
Ive knocked about too much she would explain to the Wares not to fight shy of random country cooking
When I find such a born cook as you are well I know when Im well off
Alice flushed with pleased pride at this and Theron himself felt that their visitor showed great good sense
By Saturday noon the two women were calling each other by their first names
Theron learned with a certain interest that Sister Soulsbys Christian name was Candace
It was only natural that he should give even more thought to her than to her quaint and unfamiliar old Ethiopian name
She was undoubtedly a very smart woman
To his surprise she had never introduced in her talk any of the stock religious and devotional phrases which official Methodists so universally employed in mutual converse
She might have been an insurance agent or a schoolteacher visiting in a purely secular household so little parade of cant was there about her
He caught himself wondering how old she was
She seemed to have been pretty well over the whole American continent and that must take years of time
Perhaps however the exertion of so much travel would tend to age one in appearance
Her eyes were still youthful decidedly wise eyes but still juvenile
They had sparkled with almost girlish merriment at some of his jokes
She turned them about a good deal when she spoke making their glances fit and illustrate the things she said
He had never met any one whose eyes played so constant and prominent a part in their owners conversation
Theron had never seen a play but he had encountered the portraits of famous queens of the drama several times in illustrated papers or shop windows and it occurred to him that some of the more marked contortions of Sister Soulsbys eyesnotably a trick she had of rolling them swiftly round and plunging them so to speak into an intent yearning one might almost say devouring gaze at the speakerwere probably employed by eminent actresses like Ristori and Fanny Davenport
The rest of Sister Soulsby was undoubtedly subordinated in interest to those eyes of hers
Sometimes her face seemed to be reviving temporarily a comeliness which had been constant in former days then again it would look decidedly organically plain
It was the worn and looseskinned face of a nervous middleaged woman who had had more than her share of trouble and drank too much tea
She wore the collar of her dress rather low and Theron found himself wondering at this because though long and expansive her neck certainly showed more cords and cavities than consorted with his vague ideal of statuesque beauty
Then he wondered at himself for thinking about it and abruptly reined up his fancy only to find that it was playing with speculations as to whether her yellowish complexion was due to that teadrinking or came to her as a legacy of Southern blood
He knew that she was born in the South because she said so
From the same source he learned that her father had been a wealthy planter who was ruined by the war and sank into a premature grave under the weight of his accumulated losses
The large dark rings around her eyes grew deeper still in their shadows when she told about this and her ordinarily sharp voice took on a mellow cadence with a soft drawling accent turning Us into Os and having no Rs to speak of
Theron had imbibed somewhere in early days the conviction that the South was the land of romance of cavaliers and gallants and black eyes flashing behind mantillas and outspread fans and somehow when Sister Soulsby used this intonation she suggested all these things
But almost all her talk was in another keya brisk direct idiomatic manner of speech with an intonation hinting at no section in particular
It was merely that of the citydweller as distinguished from the rustic
She was of about Alices height perhaps a shade taller
It did not escape the attention of the Wares that she wore clothes of a more stylish cut and a livelier arrangement of hues than any Alice had ever dared own even in laxminded Tyre
The two talked of this in their room on Friday night and Theron explained that congregations would tolerate things of this sort with a stranger which would be sharply resented in the case of local folk whom they controlled
It was on this occasion that Alice in turn told Theron she was sure Mrs Soulsby had false teetha confidence which she immediately regretted as an act of treachery to her sex
On Saturday afternoon toward evening Brother Soulsby arrived and was guided to the parsonage by his wife who had gone to the depot to meet him
They must have talked over the situation pretty thoroughly on the way for by the time the newcomer had washed his face and hands and put on a clean collar Sister Soulsby was ready to announce her plan of campaign in detail
Her husband was a man of small stature and like herself of uncertain age
He had a gentle if rather dry cleanshaven face and wore his dustcolored hair long behind
His little figure was clad in black clothes of a distinctively clerical fashion and he had a white neckcloth neatly tied under his collar
The Wares noted that he looked clean and amiable rather than intellectually or spiritually powerful as he took the vacant seat between theirs and joined them in concentrating attention upon Mrs Soulsby
This lady holding herself erect and alert on the edge of the low big easychair had the air of presiding over a meeting
My idea is she began with an easy implication that no one elses idea was needed that your Quarterly Conference when it meets on Monday must be adjourned to Tuesday
We will have the people all out tomorrow morning to lovefeast and announcement can be made there and at the morning service afterward that a series of revival meetings are to be begun that same evening
Mr Soulsby and I can take charge in the evening and well see to it that THAT packs the housefills the church to overflowing Monday evening
Then well quietly turn the meeting into a debtraising convention before they know where they are and well wipe off the best part of the load
Now dont you see she turned her eyes full upon Theron as she spoke you want to hold your Quarterly Conference AFTER this moneys been raised not before
I see what you mean Mr Ware responded gravely
But But what
Sister Soulsby interjected with vivacity
Well said Theron picking his words in the first place it rests with the Presiding Elder to say whether an adjournment can be made until Tuesday not with me
Thats all right
Leave that to me said the lady
In the second place Theron went on still more hesitatingly there seems a certainwhat shall I sayindirection inin In getting them together for a revival and springing a debtraising on them
Sister Soulsby put in
Why man alive thats the best part of it
You ought to be getting some notion by this time what these Octavius folks of yours are like
Ive only been here two days but Ive got their measure down to an allspice
Supposing you were to announce tomorrow that the debt was to be raised Monday
How many men with bankaccounts would turn up do you think
You could put them all in your eye sirall in your eye
Very possibly youre right faltered the young minister
Right
Why of course Im right she said with placid confidence
Youve got to take folks as you find them and youve got to find them the best way you can
One place can be worked managed in one way and another needs quite a different way and both ways would be dead frostscomplete failuresin a third
Brother Soulsby coughed softly here and shuffled his feet for an instant on the carpet
His wife resumed her remarks with slightly abated animation and at a slower pace
My experience she said has shown me that the Apostle was right
To properly serve the cause one must be all things to all men
I have known very queer things indeed turn out to be means of grace
You simply CANT get along without some of the wisdom of the serpent
We are commanded to have it for that matter
And now speaking of that do you know when the Presiding Elder arrives in town today and where he is going to eat supper and sleep
Theron shook his head
All I know is he isnt likely to come here he said and added sadly Im afraid hes not an admirer of mine
Perhaps thats not all his fault commented Sister Soulsby
Ill tell you something
He came in on the same train as my husband and that old trustee Pierce of yours was waiting for him with his buggy and I saw like a flash what was in the wind and the minute the train stopped I caught the Presiding Elder and invited him in your name to come right here and stay told him you and Alice were just set on his comingwouldnt take no for an answer
Of course he couldnt comeI knew well enough he had promised old Piercebut we got in our invitation anyway and it wont do you any harm
Now thats what I call having some gumptionwisdom of the serpent and so on
Im sure remarked Alice I should have been mortified to death if he had come
We lost the extensionleaf to our table in moving and four is all itll seat decently
Sister Soulsby smiled winningly into the wifes honest face
Dont you see dear she explained patiently I only asked him because I knew he couldnt come
A little butter spreads a long way if its only intelligently warmed
It was certainly very ingenious of you Theron began almost stiffly
Then he yielded to the humanities and with a kindling smile added And it was as kind as kind could be
Im afraid youre wrong about its doing me any good but I can see how well you meant it and Im grateful
We COULD have sneaked in the kitchen table perhaps while he was out in the garden and put on the extra long tablecloth interjected Alice musingly
Sister Soulsby smiled again at Sister Ware but without any words this time and Alice on the instant rose with the remark that she must be going out to see about supper
Im going to insist on coming out to help you Mrs Soulsby declared as soon as Ive talked over one little matter with your husband
Oh yes you must let me this time
I insist
As the kitchen door closed behind Mrs Ware a swift and apparently significant glance shot its way across from Sister Soulsbys roving eloquent eyes to the calmer and smaller gray orbs of her husband
He rose to his feet made some little explanation about being a gardener himself and desiring to inspect more closely some rhododendrons he had noticed in the garden and forthwith moved decorously out by the other door into the front hall
They heard his footsteps on the gravel beneath the window before Mrs Soulsby spoke again
Youre right about the Presiding Elder and youre wrong she said
He isnt what one might call precisely in love with you
Oh I know the storyhow you got into debt at Tyre and he stepped in and insisted on your being denied Tecumseh and sent here instead
HE was responsible for that then was he
broke in Theron with contracted brows
Why dont you make any effort to find out anything at ALL she asked pertly enough but with such obvious goodnature that he could not but have pleasure in her speech
Why of course he did it
Who else did you suppose
Well said the young minister despondently if hes as much against me as all that I might as well hang up my fiddle and go home
Sister Soulsby gave a little involuntary groan of impatience
She bent forward and lifting her eyes rolled them at him in a curve of downward motion which suggested to his fancy the image of two eagles in a concerted pounce upon a lamb
My friend she began with a new note of impressiveness in her voice if youll pardon my saying it you havent got the spunk of a mouse
If youre going to lay down and let everybody trample over you just as they please youre right
You MIGHT as well go home
But now here this is what I wanted to say to you Do you just keep your hands off these next few days and leave this whole thing to me
Ill pull it into shipshape for you
Nowait a minute dont interrupt now
I have taken a liking to you
Youve got brains and youve got human nature in you and heart
What you lack is SABEcommonsense
Youll get that too in time and meanwhile Im not going to stand by and see you cut up and fed to the dogs for want of it
Ill get you through this scrape and put you on your feet again rightsideupwith care because as I said I like you
I like your wife too mind
Shes a good honest little soul and she worships the very ground you tread on
Of course as long as people WILL marry in their teens the wrong people will get yoked up together
But thats neither here nor there
Shes a kind sweet little body and shes devoted to you and it isnt every intellectual man that gets even that much
But now its a go is it
You promise to keep quiet do you and leave the whole show absolutely to me
Shake hands on it
Sister Soulsby had risen and stood now holding out her hand in a frank manly fashion
Theron looked at the hand and made mental notes that there were a good many veins discernible on the small wrist and that the forearm seemed to swell out more than would have been expected in a woman producing such a general effect of leanness
He caught the shine of a thin braceletband of gold under the sleeve
A delicate significant odor just hinted its presence in the air about this outstretched arm something which was not a perfume yet deserved as gracious a name
He rose to his feet and took the proffered hand with a deliberate gesture as if he had been cautiously weighing all the possible arguments for and against this momentous compact
I promise he said gravely and the two palms squeezed themselves together in an earnest clasp
Right you are exclaimed the lady once more with cheery vivacity
Mind when its all over Im going to give you a good serious downright talking to a regular hoeingover
Im not sure I shant give you a sound shaking into the bargain
You need it
And now Im going out to help Alice
The Reverend Mr Ware remained standing after his new friend had left the room and his meditative face wore an even unusual air of abstraction
He strolled aimlessly over after a time to the desk by the window and stood there looking out at the slight figure of Brother Soulsby who was bending over and attentively regarding some pink blossoms on a shrub through what seemed to be a pocket magnifyingglass
What remained uppermost in his mind was not this interesting womans confident pledge of championship in his material difficulties
He found himself dwelling instead upon her remark about the incongruous results of early marriages
He wondered idly if the little man in the white tie fussing out there over that rhododendronbush had figured in her thoughts as an example of these evils
Then he reflected that they had been mentioned in clear relation to talk about Alice
Now that he faced this question it was as if he had been consciously ignoring and putting it aside for a long time
How was it he asked himself now that Alice who had once seemed so bright and keenwitted who had in truth started out immeasurably his superior in swiftness of apprehension and readiness in humorous quips and conceits should have grown so dull
For she was undoubtedly slow to understand things nowadays
Her absurd lugging in of the extensiontable problem when the great strategic point of that invitation foisted upon the Presiding Elder came up was only the latest sample of a score of these heavyminded exhibitions that recalled themselves to him
And outsiders were apparently beginning to notice it
He knew by intuition what those phrases good honest little soul and kind sweet little body signified when another woman used them to a husband about his wife
The very employment of that word little was enough considering that there was scarcely more than a hairs difference between Mrs Soulsby and Alice and that they were both rather tall than otherwise as the stature of women went
What she had said about the chronic misfortunes of intellectual men in such matters gave added point to those meaning phrases
Nobody could deny that geniuses and men of conspicuous talent had as a rule all through history contracted unfortunate marriages
In almost every case where their wives were remembered at all it was on account of their abnormal stupidity or bad temper or something of that sort
Take Xantippe for example and Shakespeares wife andandwell there was Byron and BulwerLytton and ever so many others
Of course there was nothing to be done about it
These things happened and one could only put the best possible face on them and live ones appointed life as patiently and contentedly as might be
And Alice undoubtedly merited all the praise which had been so generously bestowed upon her
She was good and honest and kindly and there could be no doubt whatever as to her utter devotion to him
These were tangible solid qualities which must always secure respect for her
It was true that she no longer seemed to be very popular among people
He questioned whether men for instance like Father Forbes and Dr Ledsmar would care much about her
Visions of the wifeless and academic calm in which these men spent their livesan existence consecrated to literature and knowledge and familiarity with all the loftiest and noblest thoughts of the past rose and enveloped him in a cloud of depression
No such lot would be his
He must labor along among ignorant and spiteful narrowminded people to the end of his days pocketing their insults and fawning upon the harsh hands of jealous nonentities who happened to be his official masters just to keep a roof over his heador rather Alices
He must sacrifice everything to this his ambitions his passionate desires to do real good in the world on a large scale his mental freedom yes even his chance of having truly elevating intellectual friendships
For it was plain enough that the men whose friendship would be of genuine and stimulating profit to him would not like her
Now that he thought of it she seemed latterly to make no friends at all
Suddenly as he watched in a blank sort of way Brother Soulsby take out a penknife and lop an offending twig from a rosebush against the fence something occurred to him
There was a curious exception to that rule of Alices isolation
She had made at least one friend
Levi Gorringe seemed to like her extremely
As if his mind had been a camera Theron snapped a shutter down upon this odd unbidden idea and turned away from the window
The sounds of an active almost strenuous conversation in female voices came from the kitchen
Theron opened the door noiselessly and put in his head conscious of something furtive in his intention
You must dreen every drop of water off the spinach mind before you put it over or else It was Sister Soulsbys sharp and penetrating tones which came to him
Theron closed the door again and surrendered himself once more to the circling whirl of his thoughts
CHAPTER XV A lovefeast at nine in the morning opened the public services of a Sunday still memorable in the annals of Octavius Methodism
This ceremony which four times a year preceded the sessions of the Quarterly Conference was not necessarily an event of importance
It was an occasion upon which the brethren and sisters who clung to the oldfashioned primitive ways of the itinerant circuitriders let themselves go with emphasized independence putting up more vehement prayers than usual and adding a special fervor of noise to their Amens
and other interjectionsand that was all
It was Therons first lovefeast in Octavius and as the big classroom in the church basement began to fill up and he noted how the men with ultra radical views and the women clad in the most ostentatious drabs and grays were crowding into the front seats he felt his spirits sinking
He had literally to force himself from sentence to sentence when the time came for him to rise and open the proceedings with an exhortation
He had eagerly offered this function to the Presiding Elder the Rev
Aziel P Larrabee who sat in severe silence on the little platform behind him but had been informed that the dignitary would lead off in giving testimony later on
So Theron feeling all the while the hostile eyes of the Elder burning holes in his back dragged himself somehow through the task
He had never known any such difficulty of speech before
The relief was almost overwhelming when he came to the customary part where all are adjured to be as brief as possible in witnessing for the Lord because the time belongs to all the people and the Discipline forbids the feast to last more than ninety minutes
He delivered this injunction to brevity with marked earnestness and then sat down abruptly
There was some rather boisterous singing during which the stewards beginning with the platform passed plates of bread cut in small cubes and water in big plated pitchers and tumblers about among the congregation threading their way between the long wooden benches ordinarily occupied at this hour by the children of the Sundayschool and helping each brother and sister in turn
They held by the old custom here in Octavius and all along the seats the sexes alternated as they do at a polite dinnertable
Theron impassively watched the familiar scene
The early nervousness had passed away
He felt now that he was not in the least afraid of these people even with the Presiding Elder thrown in
Folks who sang with such unintelligence and who threw themselves with such undignified fervor into this childish business of the bread and water could not be formidable antagonists for a man of intellect
He had never realized before what a spectacle the Methodist lovefeast probably presented to outsiders
What must they think of it
He had noticed that the Soulsbys sat together in the centre and toward the front
Next to Brother Soulsby sat Alice
He thought she looked pale and preoccupied and set it down in passing to her innate distaste for the somber garments she was wearing and for the company she perforce found herself in
Another head was in the way and for a time Theron did not observe who sat beside Alice on the other side
When at last he saw that it was Levi Gorringe his instinct was to wonder what the lawyer must be saying to himself about these noisy and shallow enthusiasts
A recurring emotion of loyalty to the simple people among whom after all he had lived his whole life prompted him to feel that it wasnt wholly nice of Gorringe to come and enjoy this revelation of their foolish side as if it were a circus
There was some vague memory in his mind which associated Gorringe with other lovefeasts and with a cynical attitude toward them
Oh yes
he had told how he went to one just for the sake of sitting beside the girl he admiredand was pursuing
The stewards had completed their round and the loud discordant singing came to an end
There ensued a little pause during which Theron turned to the Presiding Elder with a gesture of invitation to take charge of the further proceedings
The Elder responded with another gesture calling his attention to something going on in front
Brother and Sister Soulsby to the considerable surprise of everybody had risen to their feet and were standing in their places quite motionless and with an air of professional selfassurance dimly discernible under a large show of humility
They stood thus until complete silence had been secured
Then the woman lifting her head began to sing
The words were Rock of Ages but no one present had heard the tune to which she wedded them
Her voice was full and very sweet and had in it tender cadences which all her hearers found touching
She knew how to sing and she put forth the words so that each was distinctly intelligible
There came a part where Brother Soulsby lifting his head in turn took up a tuneful second to her air
Although the two did not as one could hear by listening closely sing the same words at the same time they produced none the less most moving and delightful harmonies of sound
The experience was so novel and charming that listeners ran ahead in their minds to fix the number of verses there were in the hymn and to hope that none would be left out
Toward the end when some of the intolerably selfconceited local singers fancying they had caught the tune started to join in they were stopped by an indignant shh
which rose from all parts of the classroom and the Soulsbys with a patient and pensive kindliness written on their uplifted faces gave that verse over again
What followed seemed obviously restrained and modified by the effect of this unlookedfor and tranquillizing overture
The Presiding Elder was known to enjoy visits to oldfashioned congregations like that of Octavius where he could indulge to the full his inner passion for highpitched passionate invocations and violent spiritual demeanor but this time he spoke temperately almost soothingly
The most tempestuous of the local witnesses for the Lord gave in their testimony in relatively pacific tones under the influence of the spell which good music had laid upon the gathering
There was the deepest interest as to what the two visitors would do in this way
Brother Soulsby spoke first very briefly and in well rounded and wellchosen if conventional phrases
His wife following him delivered in a melodious monotone some equally hackneyed remarks
The assemblage listening in rapt attention felt the suggestion of reserved power in every sentence she uttered and burst forth as she dropped into her seat in a loud chorus of approving ejaculations
The Soulsbys had captured Octavius with their first outer skirmish line
Everything seemed to move forward now with a new zest and spontaneity
Theron had picked out for the occasion the best of those sermons which he had prepared in Tyre at the time when he was justifying his ambition to be accounted a pulpit orator
It was orthodox enough but had been planned as the framework for picturesque and emotional rhetoric rather than doctrinal edification
He had never dreamed of trying it on Octavius before and only on the yesterday had quavered at his own daring in choosing it now
Nothing but the desire to show Sister Soulsby what was in him had held him to the selection
Something of this same desire no doubt swayed and steadied him now in the pulpit
The labored slowness of his beginning seemed to him to be due to nervous timidity until suddenly looking down into those big eyes of Sister Soulsbys which were bent gravely upon him from where she sat beside Alice in the ministers pew he remembered that it was instead the studied deliberation which art had taught him
He went on feeling more and more that the skill and histrionic power of his best days were returning to him were as marked as evernay had never triumphed before as they were triumphing now
The congregation watched and listened with open steadfast eyes and parted lips
For the first time in all that weary quarter their faces shone
The sustaining sparkle of their gaze lifted him to a peroration unrivalled in his own recollection of himself
He sat down and bent his head forward upon the open Bible breathing hard but suffused with a glow of satisfaction
His ears caught the music of that sighing rustle through the audience which bespeaks a profound impression
He could scarcely keep the fingers of his hands covering his bowed face in a devotional posture as they were from drumming a jubilant tattoo
His pulses did this in every vein throbbing with excited exultation
The insistent whim seized him as he still bent thus before his people to whisper to his own heart At last The dogs
The announcement that in the evening a series of revival meetings was to be inaugurated had been made at the lovefeast and it was repeated now from the pulpit with the added statement that for the once the classmeetings usually following this morning service would be suspended
Then Theron came down the steps conscious after a fashion that the Presiding Elder had laid a propitiatory hand on his shoulder and spoken amiably about the sermon and that several groups of more or less important parishioners were waiting in the aisle and the vestibule to shake hands and tell him how much they had enjoyed the sermon
His mind perversely kept hold of the thought that all this came too late
He politely smiled his way along out and overtaking the Soulsbys and his wife near the parsonage gate went in with them
At the cold pickedup noonday meal which was the Sunday rule of the house Theron rather expected that his guests would talk about the sermon or at any rate about the events of the morning
A Sabbath chill seemed to have settled upon both their tongues
They ate almost in silence and their sparse remarks touched upon topics far removed from church affairs
Alice too seemed strangely disinclined to conversation
The husband knew her face and its varying moods so well that he could see she was laboring under some very powerful and deep emotion
No doubt it was the sermon the oratorical swing of which still tingled in his own blood that had so affected her
If she had said so it would have pleased him but she said nothing
After dinner Brother Soulsby disappeared in his bedroom with the remark that he guessed he would lie down awhile
Sister Soulsby put on her bonnet and explaining that she always prepared herself for an evenings work by a long solitary walk quitted the house
Alice after she had put the dinner things away went upstairs and stayed there
Left to himself Theron spent the afternoon in the easychair and in the intervals of confused introspection read Recollections of my Youth through again from cover to cover
He went through the remarkable experiences attending the opening of the revival when evening came as one in a dream
Long before the hour for the service arrived the sexton came in to tell him that the church was already nearly full and that it was going to be impossible to present any distinction in the matter of pews
When the party from the parsonage went overafter another cold and mostly silent mealit was to find the interior of the church densely packed and people being turned away from the doors
Theron was supposed to preside over what followed and he did sit on the central chair in the pulpit between the Presiding Elder and Brother Soulsby and on the several needful occasions did rise and perfunctorily make the formal remarks required of him
The Elder preached a short but vigorously phrased sermon
The Soulsbys sang three or four timeson each occasion with familiar hymnal words set to novel concerted musicand then separately exhorted the assemblage
The husbands part seemed well done
If his speech lacked some of the fire of the divine girdings which older Methodists recalled it still led straight and with kindling fervency up to a season of power
The wife took up the word as he sat down
She had risen from one of the sideseats and speaking as she walked she moved forward till she stood within the altarrail immediately under the pulpit and from this place facing the listening throng she delivered her harangue
Those who watched her words most intently got the least sense of meaning from them
The phrases were all familiar enoughJesus a very present help Sprinkled by the Blood Comforted by the Word Sanctified by the Spirit Born into the Kingdom and a hundred othersbut it was as in the case of her singing the words were old the music was new
What Sister Soulsby said did not matter
The way she said itthe splendid searching sweep of her great eyes the vibrating roll of her voice now full of tears now scornful now boldly jubilantly triumphant the sympathetic swaying of her willowy figure under the stress of her eloquence was all wonderful
When she had finished and stood flushed and panting beneath the shadow of the pulpit she held up a hand deprecatingly as the resounding Amens
and Bless the Lords
began to well up about her
You have heard us sing she said smiling to apologize for her shortness of breath
Now we want to hear you sing
Her husband had risen as she spoke and on the instant with a far greater volume of voice than they had hitherto disclosed the two began From Greenlands Icy Mountains in the old familiar tune
It did not need Sister Soulsbys urgent and dramatic gesture to lift people to their feet
The whole assemblage sprang up and under the guidance of these two powerful leading voices thundered the hymn out as Octavius had never heard it before
While its echoes were still alive the woman began speaking again
Dont sit down
she cried
You would stand up if the President of the United States was going by even if he was only going fishing
How much more should you stand up in honor of living souls passing forward to find their Saviour
The psychological moment was upon them
Groans and cries arose and a palpable ferment stirred the throng
The exhortation to sinners to declare themselves to come to the altar was not only on the revivalists lips it seemed to quiver in the very air to be borne on every inarticulate exclamation in the clamor of the brethren
A young woman with a dazed and startled look in her eyes rose in the body of the church tremblingly hesitated for a moment and then with bowed head and blushing cheeks pressed her way out from the end of a crowded pew and down the aisle to the rail
A triumphant outburst of welcoming ejaculations swelled to the roof as she knelt there and under its impetus others followed her example
With interspersed snatches of song and shouted encouragements the excitement reached its height only when twoscore people mostly young were tightly clustered upon their knees about the rail and in the space opening upon the aisle
Above the confusion of penitential sobs and moans and the hysterical murmurings of members whose conviction of entire sanctity kept them in their seats could be heard the voices of the Presiding Elder the Soulsbys and the elderly deacons of the church who moved about among the kneeling mourners bending over them and patting their shoulders and calling out to them Fasten your thoughts on Jesus
Oh the Precious Blood
Blessed be His Name
Seek Him and you shall find Him
Cling to Jesus and Him Crucified
The Rev
Theron Ware did not with the others descend from the pulpit
Seated where he could not see Sister Soulsby he had failed utterly to be moved by the wave of enthusiasm she had evoked
What he heard her say disappointed him
He had expected from her more originality more spice of her own idiomatic individual sort
He viewed with a cold sense of aloofness the evidences of her success when they began to come forward and abase themselves at the altar
The instant resolve that come what might he would not go down there among them sprang up readymade in his mind
He saw his two companions pass him and descend the pulpit stairs and their action only hardened his resolution
If an excuse were needed he was presiding and the place to preside in was the pulpit
But he waived in his mind the whole question of an excuse
After a little he put his hand over his face leaning the elbow forward on the readingdesk
The scene below would have thrilled him to the marrow six monthsyes three months ago
He put a finger across his eyes now to half shut it out
The spectacle of these silly young mournerskneeling they knew not why trembling at they could not tell what pledging themselves frantically to dogmas and mysteries they knew nothing of under the influence of a hubbub of outcries as meaningless in their way and inspiring in much the same way as the racket of a fife and drum corpsthe spectacle saddened and humiliated him now
He was conscious of a dawning sense of shame at being even tacitly responsible for such a thing
His fancy conjured up the idea of Dr Ledsmar coming in and beholding this maudlin and unseemly scene and he felt his face grow hot at the bare thought
Looking through his fingers Theron all at once saw something which caught at his breath with a sharp clutch
Alice had risen from the ministers pewthe most conspicuous one in the churchand was moving down the aisle toward the rail her uplifted face chalklike in its whiteness and her eyes wideopen looking straight ahead
The young pastor could scarcely credit his sight
He thrust aside his hand and bent forward only to see his wife sink upon her knees among the rest and to hear this notable accession to the mourners hailed by a tumult of approving shouts
Then remembering himself he drew back and put up his hand shutting out the strange scene altogether
To see nothing at all was a relief and under cover he closed his eyes and bit his teeth together
A fresh outburst of thanksgivings spreading noisily through the congregation prompted him to peer through his fingers again
Levi Gorringe was making his way down the aislewas at the moment quite in front
Theron found himself watching this man with the stern composure of a fatalist
The clamant brethren down below were stirred to new excitement by the thought that the sceptical lawyer so long with them yet not of them had been humbled and won by the outpourings of the Spirit
Therons perceptions were keener
He knew that Gorringe was coming forward to kneel beside Alice The knowledge left him curiously undisturbed
He saw the lawyer advance gently insinuate himself past the form of some kneeling mourner who was in his way and drop on his knees close beside the bowed figure of Alice
The two touched shoulders as they bent forward beneath Sister Soulsbys outstretched hands held over them as in a blessing
Theron looked fixedly at them and professed to himself that he was barely interested
A little afterward he was standing up in his place and reading aloud a list of names which one of the stewards had given him
They were the names of those who had asked that evening to be taken into the church as members on probation
The sounds of the recent excitement were all hushed now save as two or three enthusiasts in a corner raised their voices in abrupt greeting of each name in its turn but Theron felt somehow that this noise had been transferred to the inside of his head
A continuous buzzing went on there so that the sound of his voice was faroff and unfamiliar in his ears
He read through the listcomprising some fifteen items and pronounced the names with great distinctness
It was necessary to take pains with this because the only name his blurred eyes seemed to see anywhere on the foolscap sheet was that of Levi Gorringe
When he had finished and was taking his seat some one began speaking to him from the body of the church
He saw that this was the steward who was explaining to him that the most important name of the lotthat of Brother Gorringe had not been read out
Theron smiled and shook his head
Then when the Presiding Elder touched him on the arm and assured him that he had not mentioned the name in question he replied quite simply and with another smile I thought it was the only name I did read out
Then he sat down abruptly and let his head fall to one side
There were hurried movements inside the pulpit and people in the audience had begun to stand up wonderingly when the Presiding Elder with uplifted hands confronted them
We will omit the Doxology and depart quietly after the benediction he said
Brother Ware seems to have been overcome by the heat
CHAPTER XVI When Theron woke next morning Alice seemed to have dressed and left the rooma thing which had never happened before
This fact connected itself at once in his brain with the recollection of her having made an exhibition of herself the previous eveninggoing forward before all eyes to join the unconverted and penitent sinners as if she were some tramp or shady female instead of an educated lady a professing member from her girlhood and a ministers wife
It crossed his mind that probably she had risen and got away noiselessly for very shame at looking him in the face after such absurd behavior
Then he remembered more and grasped the situation
He had fainted in church and had been brought home and helped to bed
Dim memories of unaccustomed faces in the bedroom of nauseous drugs and hushed voices came to him out of the nighttime
Now that he thought of it he was a sick man
Having settled this he went off to sleep again a feverish and broken sleep and remained in this state most of the time for the following twentyfour hours
In the brief though numerous intervals of waking he found certain things clear in his mind
One was that he was annoyed with Alice but would dissemble his feelings
Another was that it was much pleasanter to be ill than to be forced to attend and take part in those revival meetings
These two ideas came and went in a lazy drowsy fashion mixing themselves up with other vagrant fancies yet always remaining on top
In the evening the singing from the church next door filled his room
The Soulsbys part of it was worth keeping awake for
He turned over and deliberately dozed when the congregation sang
Alice came up a number of times during the day to ask how he felt and to bring him broth or toastwater
On several occasions when he heard her step the perverse inclination mastered him to shut his eyes and pretend to be asleep so that she might tiptoe out again
She had a depressed and thoughtful air and spoke to him like one whose mind was on something else
Neither of them alluded to what had happened the previous evening
Toward the close of the long day she came to ask him whether he would prefer her to remain in the house instead of attending the meeting
Go by all means he said almost curtly
The Presiding Elder and the Sundayschool superintendent called early Tuesday morning at the parsonage to make brotherly inquiries and Theron was feeling so much better that he himself suggested their coming upstairs to see him
The Elder was in good spirits he smiled approvingly and even put in a jocose word or two while the superintendent sketched for the invalid in a cheerful way the leading incidents of the previous evening
There had been an enormous crowd even greater than that of Sunday night and everybody had been looking forward to another notable and exciting season of grace
These expectations were especially heightened when Sister Soulsby ascended the pulpit stairs and took charge of the proceedings
She deferred to Pauls views about women preachers on Sundays she said but on weekdays she had just as much right to snatch brands from the burning as Paul or Peter or any other man
She went on like that in a breezy offhand fashion which tickled the audience immensely and led to the liveliest anticipations of what would happen when she began upon the evenings harvest of souls
But it was something else that happened
At a signal from Sister Soulsby the steward got up and in an unconcerned sort of way went through the throng to the rear of the church locked the doors and put the keys in their pockets
The sister dryly explained now to the surprised congregation that there was a season for all things and that on the present occasion they would suspend the glorious work of redeeming fallen human nature and take up instead the equally noble task of raising some fifteen hundred dollars which the church needed in its business
The doors would only be opened again when this had been accomplished
The brethren were much taken aback by this trick and they permitted themselves to exchange a good many scowling and indignant glances the while their professional visitors sang another of their delightfully novel sacred duets
Its charm of harmony for once fell upon unsympathetic ears
But then Sister Soulsby began another monologue defending this way of collecting money chaffing the assemblage with brighteyed impudence on their having been trapped and scoring one after another neat and jocose little personal points on local characteristics at which everybody but the individual touched grinned broadly
She was so droll and cheeky and withal effective in her talk that she quite won the crowd over
She told a story about a woodchuck which fairly brought down the house
A man she began with a quizzical twinkle in her eye told me once about hunting a woodchuck with a pack of dogs and they chased it so hard that it finally escaped only by climbing a butternuttree
But my friend I said to him woodchucks cant climb trees butternuttrees or any other kindand you know it
All he said in reply to me was This woodchuck had to climb a tree
And thats the way with this congregation
You think you cant raise 1500 but youve GOT to
So it went on
She set them all laughing and then with a twist of the eyes and a change of voice lo and behold she had them nearly crying in the same breath
Under the pressure of these jumbled emotions brethren began to rise up in their pews and say what they would give
The wonderful woman had something smart and apt to say about each fresh contribution and used it to screw up the general interest a notch further toward benevolent hysteria
With songs and jokes and impromptu exhortations and prayers she kept the thing whirling until a sort of duel of generosity began between two of the most unlikely men Erastus Winch and Levi Gorringe
Everybody had been surprised when Winch gave his first 50 but when he rose again half an hour afterward and said that owing to the high public position of some of the new members on probation he foresaw a great future for the church and so felt moved to give another 25 there was general amazement
Moved by a common instinct all eyes were turned upon Levi Gorringe and he without the slightest hesitation stood up and said he would give 100
There was something in his tone which must have annoyed Brother Winch for he shot up like a dart and called out Put me down for fifty more and that brought Gorringe to his feet with an added 50 and then the two went on raising each other till the assemblage was agape with admiring stupefaction
This gladiatorial combat might have been going on till now the Sundayschool superintendent concluded if Winch hadnt subsided
The amount of the contributions hadnt been figured up yet for Sister Soulsby kept the list but there had been a tremendous lot of money raised
Of that there could be no doubt
The Presiding Elder now told Theron that the Quarterly Conference had been adjourned yesterday till today
He and Brother Davis were even now on their way to attend the session in the church next door
The Elder added with an obvious kindly significance that though Theron was too ill to attend it he guessed his absence would do him no harm
Then the two men left the room and Theron went to sleep again
Another almost blank period ensued this time lasting for fortyeight hours
The young minister was enfolded in the coils of a fever of some sort which Brother Soulsby who had dabbled considerably in medicine admitted that he was puzzled about
Sometimes he thought that it was typhoid and then again there were symptoms which looked suspiciously like brain fever
The Methodists of Octavius counted no physician among their numbers and when on the second day Alice grew scared and decided with Brother Soulsbys assent to call in professional advice the only doctors name she could recall was that of Ledsmar
She was conscious of an instinctive dislike for the vague image of him her fancy had conjured up but the reflection that he was Therons friend and so probably would be more moderate in his charges decided her
Brother Soulsby showed a most comforting tact and swiftness of apprehension when Alice in mentioning Dr Ledsmars name disclosed by her manner a fear that his being sent for would create talk among the church people
He volunteered at once to act as messenger himself and with no better guide than her dim hints at direction found the doctor and brought him back to the parsonage
Dr Ledsmar expressly disclaimed to Soulsby all pretence of professional skill and made him understand that he went along solely because he liked Mr Ware and was interested in him and in any case would probably be of as much use as the wisest of strange physiciansa view which the little revivalist received with comprehending nods of tacit acquiescence
Ledsmar came and was taken up to the sickroom
He sat on the bedside and talked with Theron awhile and then went downstairs again
To Alices anxious inquiries he replied that it seemed to him merely a case of overwork and overworry about which there was not the slightest occasion for alarm
But he says the strangest things the wife put in
He has been quite delirious at times
That means only that his brain is taking a rest as well as his body remarked Ledsmar
That is Natures way of securing an equilibrium of reposeof recuperation
He will come out of it with his mind all the fresher and clearer
I dont believe he knows shucks
was Alices comment when she closed the street door upon Dr Ledsmar
Anybody could have come in and looked at a sick man and said Leave him alone
You expect something more from a doctor
Its his business to say what to do
And I suppose hell charge two dollars for just telling me that my husband was resting
No said Brother Soulsby he said he never practised and that he would come only as a friend
Well it isnt my idea of a friendnot to prescribe a single thing protested Alice
Yet it seemed that no prescription was needed after all
The next morning Theron woke to find himself feeling quite restored in spirits and nerves
He sat up in bed and after an instant of weakly giddiness recognized that he was all right again
Greatly pleased he got up and proceeded to dress himself
There were little recurring hints of faintness and vertigo while he was shaving but he had the sense to refer these to the fact that he was very very hungry
He went downstairs and smiled with the pleased pride of a child at the surprise which his appearance at the door created
Alice and the Soulsbys were at breakfast
He joined them and ate voraciously declaring that it was worth a months illness to have things taste so good once more
You still look white as a sheet said Alice warningly
If I were you Id be careful in my diet for a spell yet
For answer Theron let Sister Soulsby help him again to ham and eggs
He talked exclusively to Sister Soulsby or rather invited her by his manner to talk to him and listened and watched her with indolent content
There was a sort of happy and purified languor in his physical and mental being which needed and appreciated just this to sit next a bright and attractive woman at a good breakfast and be ministered to by her sprightly conversation by the flash of her informing and inspiring eyes and the nameless sense of support and repose which her near proximity exhaled
He felt himself figuratively leaning against Sister Soulsbys buoyant personality and resting
Brother Soulsby like the intelligent creature he was ate his breakfast in peace but Alice would interpose remarks from time to time
Theron was conscious of a certain annoyance at this and knew that he was showing it by an exaggerated display of interest in everything Sister Soulsby said and persisted in it
There trembled in the background of his thoughts ever and again the recollection of a grievance against his wifean offence which she had committedbut he put it aside as something to be grappled and dealt with when he felt again like taking up the serious and disagreeable things of life
For the moment he desired only to be amused by Sister Soulsby
Her casual mention of the fact that she and her husband were taking their departure that very day appealed to him as an added reason for devoting his entire attention to her
You mustnt forget that famous talkingto you threatened me with that regular hoeingover you know he reminded her when he found himself alone with her after breakfast
He smiled as he spoke in frank enjoyment of the prospect
Sister Soulsby nodded and aided with a roll of her eyes the effect of mockmenace in her uplifted forefinger
Oh never fear she cried
Youll catch it hot and strong
But thatll keep till afternoon
Tell me do you feel strong enough to go in next door and attend the trustees meeting this forenoon
Its rather important that you should be there if you can spur yourself up to it
By the way you havent asked what happened at the Quarterly Conference yesterday
Theron sighed and made a little grimace of repugnance
If you knew how little I cared
he said
I did hope youd forget all about mentioning thatand everything else connected withthe next door
You talk so much more interestingly about other things
Heres gratitude for you
exclaimed Sister Soulsby with a gay simulation of despair
Why man alive do you know what Ive done for you
I got around on the Presiding Elders blind side I captured old Pierce I wound Winch right around my little finger I worked two or three of the classleadersall on your account
The result was you went through as if youd had your ears pinned back and been greased all over
Youve got an extra hundred dollars added to your salary do you hear
On the sixth question of the order of business the Elder ruled that the recommendation of the last conferences estimating committee could be revised between ourselves he was wrong but that doesnt matter  and so youre in clover
And very friendly things were said about you too
It was very kind of you said Theron
I am really extremely grateful to you
He shook her by the hand to make up for what he realized to be a lack of fervor in his tones
Well then Sister Soulsby replied you pull yourself together and take your place as chairman of the trustees meeting and see to it that whatever comes up you side with old Pierce and Winch
Oh THEYRE my friends now are they
asked Theron with a faint play of irony about his lips
Yes thats your ticket this election she answered briskly and mind you vote it straight
Dont bother about reasons now
Just take it from me as the song says that things have changed since Willie died
Thats all
And then come back here and this afternoon well have a good oldfashioned jaw
The Rev
Mr Ware walking with ostentatious feebleness and forcing a conventional smile upon his wan face duly made his unexpected appearance at the trustees meeting in one of the smaller classrooms
He received their congratulations gravely and shook hands with all three
It required an effort to do this impartially because upon sight of Levi Gorringe there rose up suddenly within him an emotion of fierce dislike and enmity
In some enigmatic way his thoughts had kept themselves away from Gorringe ever since Sunday evening
Now they concentrated with furious energy and swiftness upon him
Theron seemed able in a flash of time to coordinate many recollections of Gorringethe early liking Alice had professed for him the mystery of those purchased plants in her garden the story of the girl he had lost in church his offer to lend him money the way in which he had sat beside Alice at the lovefeast and followed her to the altarrail in the evening
These raced abreast through the young ministers brain yet with each its own image and its relation to the others clearly defined
He found the nerve all the same to take this third trustee by the hand and to thank him for his congratulations and even to say with a surface smile of welcome It is BROTHER Gorringe now I remember
The work before the meeting was chiefly of a routine kind
In most places this would have been transacted by the stewards but in Octavius these minor officials had degenerated into mere ceremonial abstractions who humbly ratified or by arrangement anticipated the will of the powerful mortgageowning trustees
Theron sat languidly at the head of the table while these commonplace matters passed in their course noting the intonations of Gorringes voice as he read from his secretarys book and finding his ear displeased by them
No issue arose upon any of these trivial affairs and the minister feeling faint and weary in the heat wondered why Sister Soulsby had insisted on his coming
All at once he sat up straight with an instinctive warning in his mind that here was the thing
Gorringe had taken up the subject of the debtraising evening and read out its essentials as they had been embodied in a report of the stewards
The gross sum obtained in cash and promises was 1860
The stewards had collected of this a trifle less than half but hoped to get it all in during the ensuing quarter
There were also the bill of Mr and Mrs Soulsby for 150 and the increases of 100 in the pastors salary and 25 in the apportioned contribution of the charge toward the Presiding Elders maintenance the two latter items of which the Quarterly Conference had sanctioned
I want to hear the names of the subscribers and their amounts read out put in Brother Pierce
When this was done it became apparent that much more than half of the entire amount had been offered by two men
Levi Gorringes 450 and Erastus Winchs 425 left only 985 to be divided up among some seventy or eighty other members of the congregation
Brother Pierce speedily stopped the reading of these subordinate names
Theyre of no concern whatever he said despite the fact that his own might have been reached in time
Those first names are what I was getting at
Have those two first amounts the big ones ben paid
One hasthe other not replied Gorringe
PREcisely remarked the senior trustee
And Im goin to move that it neednt be paid either
When Brother Winch here began hollerin out those extra twentyfives and fifties that evening it was under a complete misapprehension
Hed ben on the Cheese Board that same Monday afternoon and hed done what he thought was a mighty big stroke of business and he felt liberal according
I know just what that feelin is myself
If Id ben makin a mint o money instead o losin all the while as I do Id a done just the same
But the next day lo and behold Brother Winch found that it was all a mistakehe hadnt made a single penny
Fact is I lost by the whole transaction put in Erastus Winch defiantly
Just so Brother Pierce went on
He lost money
You have his own word for it
Well then I say it would be a burning shame for us to consent to touch one penny of what he offered to give in the fullness of his heart while he was laborin under that delusion
And I move he be not asked for it
Weve got quite as much as we need without it
I put my motion
That is YOU dont put it suggested Winch correctingly
You move it and Brother Ware whom were all so glad to see able to come and presidehell put it
There was a moments silence
Youve heard the motion said Theron tentatively and then paused for possible remarks
He was not going to meddle in this thing himself and Gorringe was the only other who might have an opinion to offer
The necessities of the situation forced him to glance at the lawyer inquiringly
He did so and turned his eyes away again like a shot
Gorringe was looking him squarely in the face and the look was freighted with satirical contempt
The young minister spoke between clinched teeth
All those in favor will say aye
Brothers Pierce and Winch put up a simultaneous and confident Aye
No you dont
interposed the lawyer with deliberate sneering emphasis
I decidedly protest against Winchs voting
Hes directly interested and he mustnt vote
Your chairman knows that perfectly well
Yes I think Brother Winch ought not to vote decided Theron with great calmness
He saw now what was coming and underneath his surface composure there were sharp flutterings
Very well then said Gorringe
I vote no and its a tie
It rests with the chairman now to cast the deciding vote and say whether this interesting arrangement shall go through or not
Me
said Theron eying the lawyer with a cool selfcontrol which had come all at once to him
Me
Oh I vote Aye
CHAPTER XVII Well I did what you told me to do Theron Ware remarked to Sister Soulsby when at last they found themselves alone in the sittingroom after the midday meal
It had taken not a little strategic skirmishing to secure the room to themselves for the hospitable Alice much touched by the thought of her new friends departure that very evening had gladly proposed to let all the work stand over until night and devote herself entirely to Sister Soulsby
When finally Brother Soulsby conceived and deftly executed the coup of interesting her in the budding of roses and then leading her off into the garden to see with her own eyes how it was done Theron had a sense of being left alone with a conspirator
The notion impelled him to plunge at once into the heart of their mystery
I did what you told me to do he repeated looking up from his low easychair to where she sat by the desk and I dare say you wont be surprised when I add that I have no respect for myself for doing it
And yet you would go and do it right over again eh
the woman said in bright pert tones nodding her head and smiling at him with roguish comprehending eyes
Yes thats the way were built
We spend our lives doing that sort of thing
I dont know that you would precisely grasp my meaning said the young minister with a polite effort in his words to mask the untoward side of the suggestion
It is a matter of conscience with me and I am pained and shocked at myself
Sister Soulsby drummed for an absent moment with her thin nervous fingers on the desktop
I guess maybe youd better go and lie down again she said gently
Youre a sick man still and its no good your worrying your head just now with things of this sort
Youll see them differently when youre quite yourself again
No no pleaded Theron
Do let us have our talk out
Im all right
My mind is clear as a bell
Truly Ive really counted on this talk with you
But theres something else to talk about isnt there besidesbesides your conscience
she asked
Her eyes bent upon him a kindly pressure as she spoke which took all possible harshness from her meaning
Theron answered the glance rather than her words
I know that you are my friend he said simply
Sister Soulsby straightened herself and looked down upon him with a new intentness
Well then she began lets thrash this thing out right now and be done with it
You say its hurt your conscience to do just one little hundredth part of what there was to be done here
Ask yourself what you mean by that
Mind Im not quarrelling and Im not thinking about anything except just your own state of mind
You think you soiled your hands by doing what you did
That is to say you wanted ALL the dirty work done by other people
Thats it isnt it
The Rev
Mr Ware sat up in turn and looked doubtingly into his companions face
Oh we were going to be frank you know she added with a pleasant play of mingled mirth and honest liking in her eyes
No he said picking his words my point would rather be thatthat there ought not to have been any of what you yourself call thisthis dirty work
THAT is my feeling
Now were getting at it said Sister Soulsby briskly
My dear friend you might just as well say that potatoes are unclean and unfit to eat because manure is put into the ground they grow in
Just look at the case
Your church here was running behind every year
Your people had got into a habit of putting in nickels instead of dimes and letting you sweat for the difference
Thats a habit like tobacco or biting your fingernails or anything else
Either you were all to come to smash here or the people had to be shaken up stood on their heads broken of their habit
Its my businessmine and Soulsbys to do that sort of thing
We came here and we did it did it up brown too
We not only raised all the money the church needs and to spare but I took a personal shine to you and went out of my way to fix up things for you
It isnt only the extra hundred dollars but the whole tone of the congregation is changed toward you now
Youll see that theyll be asking to have you back here next spring
And youre solid with your Presiding Elder too
Well now tell me straightis that worth while or not
Ive told you that I am very grateful answered the minister and I say it again and I shall never be tired of repeating it
Butbut it was the means I had in mind
Quite so rejoined the sister patiently
If you saw the way a hotel dinner was cooked you wouldnt be able to stomach it
Did you ever see a play
In a theatre I mean
I supposed not
But youll understand when I say that the performance looks one way from where the audience sit and quite a different way when you are behind the scenes
THERE you see that the trees and houses are cloth and the moon is tissue paper and the flying fairy is a middleaged woman strung up on a rope
That doesnt prove that the play out in front isnt beautiful and affecting and all that
It only shows that everything in this world is produced by machineryby organization
The trouble is that youve been let in on the stage behind the scenes so to speak and youre so green if youll pardon methat you want to sit down and cry because the trees ARE cloth and the moon IS a lantern
And I say dont be such a goose
I see what you mean Theron said with an answering smile
He added more gravely All the same the Winch business seems to me Now the Winch business is my own affair Sister Soulsby broke in abruptly
I take all the responsibility for that
You need know nothing about it
You simply voted as you did on the merits of the case as he presented them thats all
But Theron began and then paused
Something had occurred to him and he knitted his brows to follow its course of expansion in his mind
Suddenly he raised his head
Then you arranged with Winch to make those bogus offers just to lead others on
he demanded
Sister Soulsbys large eyes beamed down upon him in reply at first in open merriment then more soberly till their regard was almost pensive
Let us talk of something else she said
All that is past and gone
It has nothing to do with you anyway
Ive got some advice to give you about keeping up this grip youve got on your people
The young minister had risen to his feet while she spoke
He put his hands in his pockets and with rounded shoulders began slowly pacing the room
After a turn or two he came to the desk and leaned against it
I doubt if its worth while going into that he said in the solemn tone of one who feels that an irrevocable thing is being uttered
She waited to hear more apparently
I think I shall go awaygive up the ministry he added
Sister Soulsbys eyes revealed no such shock of consternation as he unconsciously had looked for
They remained quite calm and when she spoke they deepened to fit her speech with what he read to be a gaze of affectionate melancholy one might say pity
She shook her head slowly
Nodont let any one else hear you say that she replied
My poor young friend its no good to even think it
The real wisdom is to school yourself to move along smoothly and not fret and get the best of whats going
Ive known others who felt as you doof course there are times when every young man of brains and high notions feels that waybut theres no help for it
Those who tried to get out only broke themselves
Those who stayed in and made the best of itwell one of them will be a bishop in another ten years
Theron had started walking again
But the moral degradation of it
he snapped out at her over his shoulder
Id rather earn the meanest living at an honest trade and be free from it
That may all be responded Sister Soulsby
But it isnt a question of what youd rather do
Its what you can do
How could you earn a living
What trade or business do you suppose you could take up now and get a living out of
Not one my man not one
Theron stopped and stared at her
This view of his capabilities came upon him with the force and effect of a blow
I dont discover myself he began stumblingly that Im so conspicuously inferior to the men I see about me who do make livings and very good ones too
Of course youre not she replied with easy promptness youre greatly the other way or I shouldnt be taking this trouble with you
But youre what you are because youre where you are
The moment you try on being somewhere else youre done for
In all this world nobody else comes to such unmerciful and universal grief as the unfrocked priest
The phrase sent Therons fancy roving
I know a Catholic priest he said irrelevantly who doesnt believe an atom inin things
Very likely said Sister Soulsby
Most of us do
But you dont hear him talking about going and earning his living Ill bet
Or if he does he takes powerful good care not to go all the same
Theyve got horsesense those priests
Theyre artists too
They know how to allow for the machinery behind the scenes
But its all so different urged the young minister the same things are not expected of them
Now I sat the other night and watched those people you got up around the altarrail groaning and shouting and crying and the others jumping up and down with excitement and Sister Lovejoydid you see hercoming out of her pew and regularly waltzing in the aisle with her eyes shut like a whirling dervishI positively believe it was all that made me ill
I couldnt stand it
I cant stand it now
I wont go back to it
Nothing shall make me
Ohh yes you will she rejoined soothingly
Theres nothing else to do
Just put a good face on it and make up your mind to get through by treading on as few corns as possible and keeping your own toes well in and youll be surprised how easy itll all come to be
You were speaking of the revival business
Now that exemplifies just what I was sayingits a part of our machinery
Now a church is like everything elseits got to have a boss a head an authority of some sort that people will listen to and mind
The Catholics are different as you say
Their church is chuckfull of authorityall the way from the Pope down to the priestand accordingly they do as theyre told
But the Protestantsyour Methodists most of allthey say No we wont have any authority we wont obey any boss
Very well what happens
We who are responsible for running the thing and raising the money and so onwe have to put on a spurt every once in a while and work up a general state of excitement and while its going dont you see that THAT is the authority the motive power whatever you like to call it by which things are done
Other denominations dont need it
We do and thats why weve got it
But the mean dishonesty of it all
Theron broke forth
He moved about again his bowed face drawn as with bodily suffering
The lowborn tricks the hypocrisies
I feel as if I could never so much as look at these people here again without disgust
Oh now thats where you make your mistake Sister Soulsby put in placidly
These people of yours are not a whit worse than other people
Theyve got their good streaks and their bad streaks just like the rest of us
Take them by and large theyre quite on a par with other folks the whole country through
I dont believe theres another congregation in the Conference wherewhere this sort of thing would have been needed or I might say tolerated insisted Theron
Perhaps youre right the other assented but that only shows that your people here are different from the others not that theyre worse
You dont seem to realize Octavius so far as the Methodists are concerned is twenty or thirty years behind the times
Now that has its advantages and its disadvantages
The church here is tough and coarse and full of grit like a grindstone and it does ministers from other more niminypiminy places all sorts of good to come here once in a while and rub themselves up against it
It scours the rust and mildew off from their piety and they go back singing and shouting
But of course its had a different effect with you
Youre razorsteel instead of scythesteel and the grindings been too rough and violent for you
But you see what I mean
These people here really take their primitive Methodism seriously
To them the profession of entire sanctification is truly a genuine thing
Well dont you see when people just know that theyre saved it doesnt seem to them to matter so much what they do
They feel that ordinary rules may well be bent and twisted in the interest of people so supernaturally good as they are
Thats pure human nature
Its always been like that
Theron paused in his walk to look absently at her
That thought he said in a vague slow way seems to be springing up in my path whichever way I turn
It oppresses me and yet it fascinates methis idea that the dead men have known more than we know done more than we do that there is nothing new anywhere that Never mind the dead men interposed Sister Soulsby
Just you come and sit down here
I hate to have you straddling about the room when Im trying to talk to you
Theron obeyed and as he sank into the low seat Sister Soulsby drew up her chair and put her hand on his shoulder
Her gaze rested upon his with impressive steadiness
And now I want to talk seriously to you as a friend she began
You mustnt breathe to any living soul the shadow of a hint of this nonsense about leaving the ministry
I could see how you were feelingI saw the book you were reading the first time I entered this roomand that made me like you only I expected to find you mixing up more worldly gumption with your Renan
Well perhaps I like you all the better for not having itfor being so delightfully fresh
At any rate that made me sail in and straighten your affairs for you
And now for Gods sake keep them straight
Just put all notions of anything else out of your head
Watch your chief men and women and be friends with them
Keep your eye open for what they think you ought to do and do it
Have your own ideas as much as you like read what you like say Damn under your breath as much as you like but dont let go of your job
Ive knocked about too much and Ive seen too many promising young fellows cut their own throats for pure moonshine not to have a right to say that
Theron could not be insensible to the friendly hand on his shoulder or to the strenuous sincerity of the voice which thus adjured him
Well he said vaguely smiling up into her earnest eyes if we agree that it IS moonshine
See here
she exclaimed with renewed animation patting his shoulder in a brisk automatic way to point the beginnings of her confidences Ill tell you something
Its about myself
Ive got a religion of my own and its got just one plank in it and that is that the time to separate the sheep from the goats is on Judgment Day and that it cant be done a minute before
The young minister took in the thought and turned it about in his mind and smiled upon it
And that brings me to what Im going to tell you Sister Soulsby continued
She leaned back in her chair and crossed her knees so that one wellshaped and artistically shod foot poised itself close to Therons hand
Her eyes dwelt upon his face with an engaging candor
I began life she said as a girl by running away from a stupid home with a man that I knew was married already
After that I supported myself for a good many yearsgenerally at first on the stage
Ive been a frontranker in Amazon ballets and Ive been leading lady in comic opera companies out West
Ive told fortunes in one room of a miningcamp hotel where the biggest game of faro in the Territory went on in another
Ive been a professional clairvoyant and Ive been a professional medium and Ive been within one vote of being indicted by a grand jury and the money that bought that vote was put up by the smartest and most famous traingambler between Omaha and Frisco a gentleman who died in his boots and took three sheriffs deputies along with him to KingdomCome
Now thats MY record
Theron looked earnestly at her and said nothing
And now take Soulsby she went on
Of course I take it for granted theres a good deal that he has never felt called upon to mention
He hasnt what you may call a talkative temperament
But there is also a good deal that I do know
Hes been an actor too and to this day Id back him against Edwin Booth himself to recite Clarences Dream
And hes been a medium and then he was a travelling phrenologist and for a long time he was advance agent for a British Blondes show and when I first saw him he was lecturing on female diseases and he had HIS little turn with a grand jury too
In fact he was what you may call a regular bad old rooster
Again Theron suffered the pause to lapse without comment save for an amorphous sort of conversation which he felt to be going on between his eyes and those of Sister Soulsby
Well then she resumed so much for us apart
Now about us together
We liked each other from the start
We compared notes and we found that we had both soured on living by fakes and that we were tired of the road and wanted to settle down and be respectable in our old age
We had a little moneyenough to see us through a year or two
Soulsby had always hungered and longed to own a garden and raise flowers and had never been able to stay long enough in one place to see so much as a beanpod ripen
So we took a little place in a quiet country village down on the Southern Tier and he planted everything three deep all over the place and I bought a roomful of cheap good books and we started in
We took to it like ducks to water for a while and I dont say that we couldnt have stood it out just doing nothing to this very day but as luck would have it during the first winter there was a revival at the local Methodist church and we went every eveningat first just to kill time and then because we found we liked the noise and excitement and general racket of the thing
After it was all over each of us found that the other had been mighty near going up to the rail and joining the mourners
And another thing had occurred to each of us toothat is what tremendous improvements there were possible in the way that amateur revivalist worked up his business
This stuck in our crops and we figured on it all through the winterWell to make a long story short we finally went into the thing ourselves
Tell me one thing interposed Theron
Im anxious to understand it all as we go along
Were you and he at any time sincerely convertedthat is I mean genuinely convicted of sin and conscious ofyou know what I mean
Oh bless you yes responded Sister Soulsby
Not only oncedozens of timesI may say every time
We couldnt do good work if we werent
But thats a matter of temperamentof emotions
Precisely
That was what I was getting at explained Theron
Well then hear what I was getting at she went on
You were talking very loudly here about frauds and hypocrisies and so on a few minutes ago
Now I say that Soulsby and I do good and that were good fellows
Now take him for example
There isnt a better citizen in all Chemung County than he is or a kindlier neighbor or a better or more charitable man
Ive known him to stay up a whole winters night in a poor Irishmans stinking and freezing stable trying to save his carthorse for him that had been seized with some sort of fit
The mans whole livelihood and his familys was in that horse and when it died Soulsby bought him another and never told even ME about it
Now that I call real piety if you like
So do I put in Theron cordially
And this question of fraud pursued his companion look at it in this light
You heard us sing
Well now I was a singer of course but Soulsby hardly knew one note from another
I taught him to sing and he went at it patiently and diligently like a little man
And I invented that scheme of finding tunes which the crowd didnt know and so couldnt break in on and smother
I simply took Chopinhe is full of sixths you know and I got all sorts of melodies out of his waltzes and mazurkas and nocturnes and so on and I trained Soulsby just to sing those sixths so as to make the harmony and there you are
He couldnt sing by himself any more than a crow but hes got those sixths of his down to a hair
Now thats machinery management organization
We take these tunes written by a devilmaycare Pole who was living with George Sand openly at the time and pass em off on the brethren for hymns
Its a fraud yes but its a good fraud
So they are all good frauds
I say frankly that Im glad that the change and the chance came to help Soulsby and me to be good frauds
And the point is that Im to be a good fraud too commented the young minister
She had risen and he got to his feet as well
He instinctively sought for her hand and pressed it warmly and held it in both his with an exuberance of gratitude and liking in his manner
Sister Soulsby danced her eyes at him with a saucy little shake of the head
Im afraid youll never make a really GOOD fraud she said
You havent got it in you
Your intentions are all right but your execution is hopelessly clumsy
I came up to your bedroom there twice while you were sick just to say howdy and you kept your eyes shut and all the while a blind horse could have told that you were wide awake
I must have thought it was my wife said Theron
PART III CHAPTER XVIII When the lingering dusk finally settled down upon this long summer evening the train bearing the Soulsbys homeward was already some score of miles on its way and the Methodists of Octavius had nearly finished their weekly prayermeeting
After the stirring events of the revival it was only to be expected that this routine homemade affair should suffer from a reaction
The attendance was larger than usual perhaps but the proceedings were spiritless and tame
Neither the pastor nor his wife was present at the beginning and the classleader upon whom control devolved made but feeble headway against the spell of inertia which the hot nightair laid upon the gathering
Long pauses intervened between the perfunctory praiseofferings and supplications and the hymns weariedly raised from time to time fell again in languor by the wayside
Alice came in just as people were beginning to hope that some one would start the Doxology and bring matters to a close
Her appearance apparently suggested this to the classleader for in a few moments the meeting had been dismissed and some of the members on their way out were shaking hands with their ministers wife and expressing the polite hope that he was better
The worried look in her face and the obvious stains of recent tears upon her cheeks imparted an added point and fervor to these inquiries but she replied to all in tones of studied tranquillity that although not feeling well enough to attend prayermeeting Brother Ware was steadily recovering strength and confidently expected to be in complete health by Sunday
They left her and could hardly wait to get into the vestibule to ask one another in whispers what on earth she could have been crying about
Meanwhile Brother Ware improved his convalescent state by pacing slowly up and down under the elms on the side of the street opposite the Catholic church
There were no houses here for a block and more the sidewalk was broken in many places so that passersby avoided it the overhanging boughs shrouded it all in obscurity it was preeminently a place to be alone in
Theron had driven to the depot with his guests an hour before and after a period of pleasant waiting on the platform had said goodbye to them as the train moved away
Then he turned to Alice who had also accompanied them in the carriage and was conscious of a certain annoyance at her having come
That long familiar talk of the afternoon had given him the feeling that he was entitled to bid farewell to Sister Soulsbyto both the Soulsbys by himself
I am afraid folks will think it strangeneither of us attending the prayermeeting he said with a suggestion of reproof in his tone as they left the stationyard
If we get back in time Ill run in for a minute answered Alice with docility
Nono he broke in
Im not equal to walking so fast
You run on ahead and explain matters and I will come along slowly
The hack we came in is still there in the yard the wife suggested
We could drive home in that
I dont believe it would cost more than a quarter and if youre feeling badly But I am NOT feeling badly Theron replied with frank impatience
Only I feelI feel that being alone with my thoughts would be good for me
Oh certainlyby all means
Alice had said and turned sharply on her heel
Being alone with these thoughts Theron strolled aimlessly about and did not think at all
The shadows gathered and fireflies began to disclose their tiny gleams among the shrubbery in the gardens
A lamplighter came along and passed him leaving in his wake a straggling double line of lights glowing radiantly against the blackgreen of the trees
This recalled to Theron that he had heard that the town council lit the street lamps by the almanac and economized gas when moonshine was due
The idea struck him as droll and he dwelt upon it in various aspects smiling at some of its comic possibilities
Looking up in the middle of one of these whimsical conceits the sportive impulse died suddenly within him
He realized that it was dark and that the massive black bulk reared against the sky on the other side of the road was the Catholic church
The other fact that he had been there walking to and fro for some time was borne in upon him more slowly
He turned and resumed the pacing up and down with a still more leisurely step musing upon the curious way in which peoples minds all unconsciously follow about where instincts and intuitions lead
No doubt it was what Sister Soulsby had said about Catholics which had insensibly guided his purposeless stroll in this direction
What a woman that was
Somehow the purport of her talkstriking and even astonishing as he had found itdid not stand out so clearly in his memory as did the image of the woman herself
She must have been extremely pretty once
For that matter she still was a most attractivelooking woman
It had been a genuine pleasure to have her in the house to see her intelligent responsive face at the table to have it in ones power to make drafts at will upon the fund of sympathy and appreciation of facile mirth and ready tenderness in those big eyes of hers
He liked that phrase she had used about herselfa good fellow
It seemed to fit her to a t And Soulsby was a good fellow too
All at once it occurred to him to wonder whether they were married or not
But really that was no affair of his he reflected
A citizen of the intellectual world should be above soiling his thoughts with mean curiosities of that sort and he drove the impertinent query down again under the surface of his mind
He refused to tolerate as well sundry vagrant imaginings which rose to cluster about and literalize the romance of her youth which Sister Soulsby had so frankly outlined
He would think upon nothing but her as he knew herthe kindly quickwitted capable and charming woman who had made such a brilliant break in the monotony of life at that dull parsonage of his
The only genuine happiness in life must consist in having bright smart attractive women like that always about
The lights were visible now in the upper rooms of Father Forbes pastorate across the way
Theron paused for a second to consider whether he wanted to go over and call on the priest
He decided that mentally he was too fagged and flat for such an undertaking
He needed another sort of companionship some restful soothing human contact which should exact nothing from him in return but just take charge of him with soft wise words and pleasant plays of fancy and jokes andandsomething of the general effect created by Sister Soulsbys eyes
The thought expanded itself and he saw that he had never realized beforenay never dreamt beforewhat a mighty part the comradeship of talented sweetnatured and beautiful women must play in the development of genius the achievement of lofty aims out in the great world of great men
To know such womenah that would never fall to his hapless lot
The priests lamps blinked at him through the trees
He remembered that priests were supposed to be even further removed from the possibilities of such contact than he was himself
His memory reverted to that horribly ugly old woman whom Father Forbes had spoken of as his housekeeper
Life under the same roof with such a hag must be even worse thanworse than The young minister did not finish the comparison even in the privacy of his inner soul
He stood instead staring over at the pastorate in a kind of stupor of arrested thought
The figure of a woman passed in view at the nearest window a tall figure with pale summer clothes of some sort and a broad summer hata flitting effect of diaphanous shadow between him and the light which streamed from the casement
Theron felt a little shiver run over him as if the delicate coolness of the changing nightair had got into his blood
The window was open and his strained hearing thought it caught the sound of faint laughter
He continued to gaze at the place where the vision had appeared the while a novel and strange perception unfolded itself upon his mind
He had come there in the hope of encountering Celia Madden
Now that he looked this fact in the face there was nothing remarkable about it
In truth it was simplicity itself
He was still a sick man weak in body and dejected in spirits
The thought of how unhappy and unstrung he was came to him now with an insistent pathos that brought tears to his eyes
He was only obeying the universal law of naturethe law which prompts the pallid spindling sprout of the potato in the cellar to strive feebly toward the light
From where he stood in the darkness he stretched out his hands in the direction of that open window
The gesture was his confession to the overhanging boughs to the soft nightbreeze to the stars aboveand it bore back to him something of the confessionals vague and wistful solace
He seemed already to have drawn down into his soul a taste of the refreshment it craved
He sighed deeply and the hot moisture smarted again upon his eyelids but this time not all in grief
With his tender compassion for himself there mingled now a flutter of buoyant prescience of exquisite expectancy
Fate walked abroad this summer night
The street door of the pastorate opened and in the flood of illumination which spread suddenly forth over the steps and sidewalk Theron saw again the tall form with the indefinitely lighthued flowing garments and the wide straw hat
He heard a tuneful womans voice call out Goodnight Maggie and caught no response save the abrupt closing of the door which turned everything black again with a bang
He listened acutely for another instant and then with long noiseless strides made his way down his deserted side of the street
He moderated his pace as he turned to cross the road at the corner and then still masked by the trees halted altogether in a momentary tumult of apprehension
Noyesit was all right
The girl sauntered out from the total darkness into the dim starlight of the open corner
Why bless me is that you Miss Madden
Celia seemed to discern readily enough through the accents of surprise the identity of the tall slim man who addressed her from the shadows
Goodevening Mr Ware she said with prompt affability
Im so glad to find you out again
We heard you were ill I have been very ill responded Theron as they shook hands and walked on together
He added with a quaver in his voice I am still far from strong
I really ought not to be out at all
Butbut the longing forforwell I COULDNT stay in any longer
Even if it kills me I shall be glad I came out tonight
Oh we wont talk of killing said Celia
I dont believe in illnesses myself But you believe in collapses of the nerves put in Theron with gentle sadness in moral and spiritual and mental breakdowns
I remember how I was touched by the way you told me YOU suffered from them
I had to take what you said then for granted
I had had no experience of it myself
But now I know what it is
He drew a long pathetic sigh
Oh DONT I know what it is
he repeated gloomily
Come my friend cheer up Celia purred at him in soothing tones
He felt that there was a deliciously feminine and sisterly intuition in her speech and in the helpful nurselike way in which she drew his arm through hers
He leaned upon this support and was glad of it in every fibre of his being
Do you remember
You promisedthat last time I saw you to play for me he reminded her
They were passing the little covered postern door at the side and rear of the church as he spoke and he made a half halt to point the coincidence
Oh theres no one to blow the organ she said divining his suggestion
And I havent the key and besides the organ is too heavy and severe for an invalid
It would overwhelm you tonight
Not as you would know how to play it for me urged Theron pensively
I feel as if good music tonight would make me well again
I am really very ill and weak and unhappy
The girl seemed moved by the despairing note in his voice
She invited him by a sympathetic gesture to lean even more directly on her arm
Come home with me and Ill play Chopin to you she said in compassionate friendliness
He is the real medicine for bruised and wounded nerves
You shall have as much of him as you like
The idea thus unexpectedly thrown forth spread itself like some vast and inexpressibly alluring vista before Therons imagination
The spice of adventure in it fascinated his mind as well but for a shrinking moment the flesh was weak
Im afraid your people wouldwould think it strange he falteredand began also to recall that he had some people of his own who would be even more amazed
Nonsense said Celia in fine bold confidence and with a reassuring pressure on his arm
I allow none of my people to question what I do
They never dream of such a preposterous thing
Besides you will see none of them
Mrs Madden is at the seaside and my father and brother have their own part of the house
I shant listen for a minute to your not coming
Come Im your doctor
Im to make you well again
There was further conversation and Theron more or less knew that he was bearing a part in it but his whole mind seemed concentrated in a sort of delicious terror upon the wonderful experience to which every footstep brought him nearer
His magnetized fancy pictured a great spacious parlor such as a mansion like the Maddens would of course contain and there would be a grand piano and lace curtains and paintings in gold frames and a chandelier and velvet easychairs and he would sit in one of these surrounded by all the luxury of the rich while Celia played to him
There would be servants about he presumed and very likely they would recognize him and of course they would talk about it to Tom Dick and Harry afterward
But he said to himself defiantly that he didnt care
He withdrew his arm from hers as they came upon the welllighted main street
He passed no one who seemed to know him
Presently they came to the Madden place and Celia without waiting for the gravelled walk struck obliquely across the lawn
Theron who had been lagging behind with a certain circumspection stepped briskly to her side now
Their progress over the soft closecropped turf in the dark together with the scent of lilies and perfumed shrubs heavy on the night air and the majestic bulk of the big silent house rising among the trees before them gave him a thrilling sense of the glory of individual freedom
I feel a new man already he declared as they swung along on the grass
He breathed a long sigh of content and drew nearer so that their shoulders touched now and again as they walked
In a minute more they were standing on the doorstep and Theron heard the significant jingle of a bunch of keys which his companion was groping for in her elusive pocket
He was conscious of trembling a little at the sound
It seemed that unlike other people the Maddens did not have their parlor on the groundfloor opening off the front hall
Theron stood in the complete darkness of this hall till Celia had lit one of several candles which were in their handsticks on a sort of sideboard next the hatrack
She beckoned him with a gesture of her head and he followed her up a broad staircase magnificent in its structural appointments of inlaid woods and carpeted with what to his feet felt like down
The tiny light which his guide bore before her half revealed as they passed in their ascent tall lengths of tapestry and the dull glint of armor and brazen discs in shadowed niches on the nearer wall
Over the stairrail lay an open space of such stately dimensions bounded by terminal lines of decoration so distant in the faint candleflicker that the young country minister could think of no word but palatial to fit it all
At the head of the flight Celia led the way along a wide corridor to where it ended
Here stretched from side to side and suspended from broad hoops of a copperlike metal was a thick curtain of a uniform color which Theron at first thought was green and then decided must be blue
She pushed its heavy folds aside and unlocked another door
He passed under the curtain behind her and closed the door
The room into which he had made his way was not at all after the fashion of any parlor he had ever seen
In the obscure light it was difficult to tell what it resembled
He made out what he took to be a painters easel standing forth independently in the centre of things
There were rows of books on rude low shelves
Against one of the two windows was a big flat writingtable or was it a drawingtablelittered with papers
Under the other window was a carpenters bench with a large mound of something at one end covered with a white cloth
On a table behind the easel rose a tall mechanical contrivance the chief feature of which was a thick upright spiral screw
The floor was of bare wood stained brown
The walls of this queer room had photographs and pictures taken apparently from illustrated papers pinned up at random for their only ornament
Celia had lighted three or four other candles on the mantel
She caught the dumfounded expression with which her guest was surveying his surroundings and gave a merry little laugh
This is my workshop she explained
I keep this for the things I do badlythings I fool with
If I want to paint or model in clay or bind books or write or draw or turn on the lathe or do some carpentering heres where I do it
All the things that make a mess which has to be cleaned upthey are kept out here because this is as far as the servants are allowed to come
She unlocked still another door as she spokea door which was also concealed behind a curtain
Now she said holding up the candle so that its reddish flare rounded with warmth the creamy fulness of her chin and throat and glowed upon her hair in a flame of orange lightnow I will show you what is my very own
CHAPTER XIX Theron Ware looked about him with frankly undisguised astonishment
The room in which he found himself was so dark at first that it yielded little to the eye and that little seemed altogether beyond his comprehension
His gaze helplessly followed Celia and her candle about as she busied herself in the work of illumination
When she had finished and pinched out the taper there were seven lights in the apartmentlights beaming softly through halfopaque alternating rectangles of blue and yellow glass
They must be set in some sort of lanterns around against the wall he thought but the shape of these he could hardly make out
Gradually his sight adapted itself to this subdued light and he began to see other things
These queer lamps were placed apparently so as to shed a special radiance upon some statues which stood in the corners of the chamber and upon some pictures which were embedded in the walls
Theron noted that the statues the marble of which lost its aggressive whiteness under the tinted lights were mostly of naked men and women the pictures four or five in number were all variations of a single theme the Virgin Mary and the Child
A less untutored vision than his would have caught more swiftly the scheme of color and line in which these works of art bore their share
The walls of the room were in part of flat upright wooden columns terminating high above in simple capitals and they were all painted in pale amber and straw and primrose hues irregularly wavering here and there toward suggestions of white
Between these pilasters were broader panels of stamped leather in gently varying shades of peacock blue
These contrasted colors vaguely interwove and mingled in what he could see of the shadowed ceiling far above
They were repeated in the draperies and huge cushions and pillows of the low wide divan which ran about three sides of the room
Even the floor where it revealed itself among the scattered rugs was laid in a mosaic pattern of matched woods which like the rugs gave back these same shifting blues and uncertain yellows
The fourth side of the apartment was broken in outline at one end by the door through which they had entered and at the other by a broad square opening hung with loopedback curtains of a thin silken stuff
Between the two apertures rose against the wall what Theron took at first glance to be an altar
There were pyramidal rows of tall candles here on either side each masked with a little silken hood below in the centre a shelflike projection supported what seemed a massive carved casket and in the beautiful intricacies of this and the receding canopy of delicate ornamentation which depended above it the dominant color was white deepening away in its shadows by tenderly minute gradations to the tints which ruled the rest of the room
Celia lighted some of the high thick tapers in these candelabra and opened the top of the casket
Theron saw with surprise that she had uncovered the keyboard of a piano
He viewed with much greater amazement her next proceeding which was to put a cigarette between her lips and bending over one of the candles with it for an instant turn to him with a filmy opalescent veil of smoke above her head
Make yourself comfortable anywhere she said with a gesture which comprehended all the divans and pillows in the place
Will you smoke
I have never tried since I was a little boy said Theron but I think I could
If you dont mind I should like to see
Lounging at his ease on the oriental couch Theron experimented cautiously upon the unaccustomed tobacco and looked at Celia with what he felt to be the confident quiet of a man of the world
She had thrown aside her hat and in doing so had half released some of the heavy strands of hair coiled at the back of her head
His glance instinctively rested upon this wonderful hair of hers
There was no mistaking the sudden fascination its disorder had for his eye
She stood before him with the cigarette poised daintily between thumb and finger of a shapely hand and smiled comprehendingly down on her guest
I suffered the horrors of the damned with this hair of mine when I was a child she said
I daresay all children have a taste for persecuting redheads but its a specialty with Irish children
They get hold somehow of an ancient national superstition or legend that red hair was brought into Ireland by the Danes
Its been a term of reproach with us since Brian Borus time to call a child a Dane
I used to be pursued and baited with it every day of my life until the one dream of my ambition was to get old enough to be a Sister of Charity so that I might hide my hair under one of their big beastly white linen caps
Ive got rather away from that ideal since Im afraid she added with a droll downward curl of her lip
Your hair is very beautiful said Theron in the calm tone of a connoisseur
I like it myself Celia admitted and blew a little smokering toward him
Ive made this whole room to match it
The colors I mean she explained in deference to his uplifted brows
Between us we make up what Whistler would call a symphony
That reminds me I was going to play for you
Let me finish the cigarette first
Theron felt grateful for her reticence about the fact that he had laid his own aside
I have never seen a room at all like this he remarked
You are right it does fit you perfectly
She nodded her sense of his appreciation
It is what I like she said
It expresses ME
I will not have anything about meor anybody eitherthat I dont like
I suppose if an old Greek could see it it would make him sick but it represents what I mean by being a Greek
It is as near as an Irishman can get to it
I remember your puzzling me by saying that you were a Greek
Celia laughed and tossed the cigaretteend away
Id puzzle you more Im afraid if I tried to explain to you what I really meant by it
I divide people up into two classes you knowGreeks and Jews
Once you get hold of that principle all other divisions and classifications such as by race or language or nationality seem pure foolishness
It is the only true division there is
It is just as true among negroes or wild Indians who never heard of Greece or Jerusalem as it is among white folks
That is the beauty of it
It works everywhere always
Try it on me urged Theron with a twinkling eye
Which am I
Both said the girl with a merry nod of the head
But now Ill play
I told you you were to hear Chopin
I prescribe him for you
He is the Greekiest of the Greeks
THERE was a nation where all the people were artists where everybody was an intellectual aristocrat where the Philistine was as unknown as extinct as the dodo
Chopin might have written his music for them
I am interested in Shopang put in Theron suddenly recalling Sister Soulsbys confidences as to the source of her tunes
He lived withwhats his nameGeorge something
We were speaking about him only this afternoon
Celia looked down into her visitors face at first inquiringly then with a latent grin about her lips
YesGeorge something she said in a tone which mystified him
The Rev
Mr Ware was sitting up a minute afterward in a ferment of awakened consciousness that he had never heard the piano played before
After a little he noiselessly rearranged the cushions and settled himself again in a recumbent posture
It was beyond his strength to follow that first impulse and keep his mind abreast with what his ears took in
He sighed and lay back and surrendered his senses to the mere unthinking charm of it all
It was the Fourth Prelude that was singing in the air about hima simple plaintive strain wandering at will over a surface of steady rhythmic movement underneath always creeping upward through mysteries of sweetness always sinking again in cadences of semitones
With only a moments pause there came the Seventh Waltz a rich bold confusion which yet was not confused
Therons ears dwelt with eager delight upon the chasing medley of swift tinkling sounds but it left his thoughts free
From where he reclined he turned his head to scrutinize one by one the statues in the corners
No doubt they were beautifulfor this was a department in which he was all humilityand one of them the figure of a broadbrowed stately though thickwaisted woman bending slightly forward and with both arms broken off was decently robed from the hips downward
The others were not robed at all
Theron stared at them with the erratic rippling jangle of the waltz in his ears and felt that he possessed a new and disturbing conception of what female emancipation meant in these later days
Roving along the wall his glance rested again upon the largest of the Virgin picturesa fulllength figure in sweeping draperies its radiant aureoled head upturned in rapt adoration its feet resting on a crescent moon which shone forth in bluish silver through festooned clouds of cherubs
The incongruity between the unashamed statues and this serene incarnation of holy womanhood jarred upon him for the instant
Then his mind went to the piano
Without a break the waltz had slowed and expanded into a passage of what might be church music an exquisitely modulated and gently solemn chant through which a soft lingering song roved capriciously forcing the listener to wonder where it was coming out even while it caressed and soothed to repose
He looked from the Madonna to Celia
Beyond the carelessly drooping braids and coils of hair which blazed between the candles he could see the outline of her brow and cheek the noble contour of her lifted chin and full modelled throat all pink as the most delicate rose leaf is pink against the cool lights of the altarlike wall
The sight convicted him in the court of his own soul as a prurient and meanminded rustic
In the presence of such a face of such music there ceased to be any such thing as nudity and statues no more needed clothes than did those slow deep magnificent chords which came now gravely accumulating their spell upon him
It is all singing
the player called out to him over her shoulder in a minute of rest
That is what Chopin does he sings
She began with an effect of thinking of something else the Sixth Nocturne and Theron at first thought she was not playing anything in particular so deliberately haltingly did the chain of charm unwind itself into sequence
Then it came closer to him than the others had done
The dreamy wistful meditative beauty of it all at once oppressed and inspired him
He saw Celias shoulders sway under the impulse of the RUBATO licensethe privilege to invest each measure with the stress of the whole to loiter to weep to run and laugh at willand the music she made spoke to him as with a human voice
There was the wooing sense of roses and moonlight of perfumes white skins alluring languorous eyes and then You know this part of course he heard her say
On the instant they had stepped from the dark scented starlit garden where the nightingale sang into a great cathedral
A sombre and lofty anthem arose and filled the place with the splendor of such dignified pomp of harmony and such suggestions of measureless choral power and authority that Theron sat abruptly up then was drawn resistlessly to his feet
He stood motionless in the strange room feeling most of all that one should kneel to hear such music
This youll know toothe funeral march from the Second Sonata she was saying before he realized that the end of the other had come
He sank upon the divan again bending forward and clasping his hands tight around his knees
His heart beat furiously as he listened to the weird mediaeval processional with its wild clashing chords held down in the bondage of an orderly sadness
There was a propelling motion in the thinga sense of being borne bodily alongwhich affected him like dizziness
He breathed hard through the robust portions of stern vigorous noise and rocked himself to and fro when as rosy morn breaks upon a stormswept night the drums are silenced for the sweet comforting strain of solitary melody
The clanging minor harmonies into which the march relapses came to their abrupt end
Theron rose once more and moved with a hesitating step to the piano
I want to rest a little he said with his hand on her shoulder
Whew
so do I exclaimed Celia letting her hands fall with an exaggerated gesture of weariness
The sonatas take it out of one
They are hideously difficult you know
They are rarely played
I didnt know remarked Theron
She seemed not to mind his hand upon her shoulder and he kept it there
I didnt know anything about music at all
What I do know now is thatthat this evening is an event in my life
She looked up at him and smiled
He read unsuspected tendernesses and tolerances of friendship in the depths of her eyes which emboldened him to stir the fingers of that audacious hand in a lingering caressing trill upon her shoulder
The movement was of the faintest but having ventured it he drew his hand abruptly away
You are getting on she said to him
There was an enigmatic twinkle in the smile with which she continued to regard him
We are Hellenizing you at a great rate
A sudden thought seemed to strike her
She shifted her eyes toward vacancy with a swift abstracted glance reflected for a moment then let a sparkling halfwink and the dimpling beginnings of an almost roguish smile mark her assent to the conceit whatever it might be
I will be with you in a moment he heard her say and while the words were still in his ears she had risen and passed out of sight through the broad open doorway to the right
The looped curtains fell together behind her
Presently a mellow light spread over their delicately translucent surfacea creamy undulating radiance which gave the effect of moving about among the myriad folds of the silk
Theron gazed at these curtains for a little then straightened his shoulders with a gesture of decision and turning on his heel went over and examined the statues in the further corners minutely
If you would like some more I will play you the Berceuse now
Her voice came to him with a delicious shock
He wheeled round and beheld her standing at the piano with one hand resting palm upward on the keys
She was facing him
Her tall form was robed now in some shapeless clinging drapery lustrous and creamy and exquisitely soft like the curtains
The wonderful hair hung free and luxuriant about her neck and shoulders and glowed with an intensity of fiery color which made all the other hues of the room pale and vague
A fillet of faint skylike blue drew a gracious span through the flame of red above her temples and from this there rose the gleam of jewels
Her head inclined gently gravely toward himwith the posture of that armless woman in marble he had been studying and her brown eyes regarding him from the shadows emitted light
It is a lullabythe only one he wrote she said as Theron palefaced and with tightened lips approached her
Noyou mustnt stand there she added sinking into the seat before the instrument go back and sit where you were
The most perfect of lullabies with its swaying abandonment to cooing rhythm ever and again rising in ripples to the point of insisting on something one knows not what and then rocking melting away once more passed so to speak over Therons head
He leaned back upon the cushions and watched the white rounded forearm which the falling folds of this strange statuelike drapery made bare
There was more that appealed to his mood in the Third Ballade
It seemed to him that there were words going along with it incoherent and impulsive yet very earnest words appealing to him in strenuous argument and persuasion
Each time he almost knew what they said and strained after their meaning with a passionate desire and then there would come a kind of cuckoo call and everything would swing dancing off again into a mockery of inconsequence
Upon the silence there fell the pure liquid mellifluous melody of a softthroated woman singing to her lover
It is like Heinesimply a lovepoem said the girl over her shoulder
Theron followed now with all his senses as she carried the Ninth Nocturne onward
The stormy passage which she banged finely forth was in truth a lovers quarrel and then the mild placid flow of sweet harmonies into which the furore sank dying languorously away upon a silence all alive with tender memories of sound was that not also a part of love
They sat motionless through a minutethe man on the divan the girl at the pianoand Theron listened for what he felt must be the audible thumping of his heart
Then throwing back her head with upturned face Celia began what she had withheld for the lastthe Sixteenth Mazurka
This strange foreign thing she played with her eyes closed her head tilted obliquely so that Theron could see the rosetinted beautiful countenance framed as if asleep in the billowing luxuriance of unloosed auburn hair
He fancied her beholding visions as she wrought the music visions full of barbaric color and romantic forms
As his mind swam along with the gliding tricksy phantom of a tune it seemed as if he too could see these visions as if he gazed at them through her eyes
It could not be helped
He lifted himself noiselessly to his feet and stole with caution toward her
He would hear the rest of this weird voluptuous fantasy standing thus so close behind her that he could look down upon her full uplifted laceso close that if she moved that glowing nimbus of hair would touch him
There had been some curious and awkward pauses in this last piece which Theron by some side cerebration had put down to her not watching what her fingers did
There came another of these pauses nowan odd unaccountable halt in what seemed the middle of everything
He stared intently down upon her statuesque dreaming face during the hush and caught his breath as he waited
There fell at last a few faltering ascending notes making a halffinished strain and then again there was silence
Celia opened her eyes and poured a direct deep gaze into the face above hers
Its pale lips were parted in suspense and the color had faded from its cheeks
That is the end she said and with a turn of her lithe body stood swiftly up even while the echoes of the broken melody seemed panting in the air about her for completion
Theron put his hands to his face and pressed them tightly against eyes and brow for an instant
Then throwing them aside with an expansive downward sweep of the arms and holding them clenched he returned Celias glance
It was as if he had never looked into a womans eyes before
It CANT be the end
he heard himself saying in a low voice charged with deep significance
He held her gaze in the grasp of his with implacable tenacity
There was a trouble about breathing and the mosaic floor seemed to stir under his feet
He clung defiantly to the one idea of not releasing her eyes
How COULD it be the end
he demanded lifting an uncertain hand to his breast as he spoke and spreading it there as if to control the tumultuous fluttering of his heart
Things dont end that way
A sharp blinding spasm of giddiness closed upon and shook him while the brave words were on his lips
He blinked and tottered under it as it passed and then backed humbly to his divan and sat down gasping a little and patting his hand on his heart
There was fright written all over his whitened face
Wewe forgot that I am a sick man he said feebly answering Celias look of surprised inquiry with a forced wan smile
I was afraid my heart had gone wrong
She scrutinized him for a further moment with growing reassurance in her air
Then piling up the pillows and cushions behind him for support for all the world like a big sister again she stepped into the inner room and returned with a flagon of quaint shape and a tiny glass
She poured this latter full to the brim of a thick yellowish aromatic liquid and gave it him to drink
This Benedictine is all I happen to have she said
Swallow it down
It will do you good
Theron obeyed her
It brought tears to his eyes but upon reflection it was grateful and warming
He did feel better almost immediately
A great wave of comfort seemed to enfold him as he settled himself back on the divan
For that one flashing instant he had thought that he was dying
He drew a long grateful breath of relief and smiled his content
Celia had seated herself beside him a little away
She sat with her head against the wall and one foot curled under her and almost faced him
I dare say we forced the pace a little she remarked after a pause looking down at the floor with the puckers of a ruminating amusement playing in the corners of her mouth
It doesnt do for a man to get to be a Greek all of a sudden
He must work along up to it gradually
He remembered the music
Oh if I only knew how to tell you he murmured ecstatically what a revelation your playing has been to me
I had never imagined anything like it
I shall think of it to my dying day
He began to remember as well the spirit that was in the air when the music ended
The details of what he had felt and said rose vaguely in his mind
Pondering them his eye roved past Celias whiterobed figure to the broad open doorway beyond
The curtains behind which she had disappeared were again parted and fastened back
A dim light was burning within out of sight and its faint illumination disclosed a room filled with white marbles white silks white draperies of varying sorts which shaped themselves as he looked into the canopy and trappings of an extravagantly oversized and sumptuous bed
He looked away again
I wish you would tell me what you really mean by that Greek idea of yours he said with the abruptness of confusion
Celia did not display much enthusiasm in the tone of her answer
Oh she said almost indifferently lots of things
Absolute freedom from moral bugbears for one thing
The recognition that beauty is the only thing in life that is worth while
The courage to kick out of ones life everything that isnt worth while and so on
But said Theron watching the mingled delicacy and power of the bared arm and the shapely grace of the hand which she had lifted to her face I am going to get you to teach it ALL to me
The memories began crowding in upon him now and the baffling note upon which the mazurka had stopped short chimed like a tuningfork in his ears
I want to be a Greek myself if youre one
I want to get as close to youto your ideal that is as I can
You open up to me a whole world that I had not even dreamed existed
We swore our friendship long ago you know and now after tonightyou and the music have decided me
I am going to put the things out of MY life that are not worthwhile
Only you must help me you must tell me how to begin
He looked up as he spoke to enforce the almost tender entreaty of his words
The spectacle of a yawn only fractionally concealed behind those talented fingers chilled his soft speech and sent a flush over his face
He rose on the instant
Celia was nothing abashed at his discovery
She laughed gayly in confession of her fault and held her hand out to let him help her disentangle her foot from her draperies and get off the divan
It seemed to be her meaning that he should continue holding her hand after she was also standing
You forgive me dont you
she urged smilingly
Chopin always first excites me then sends me to sleep
You see how YOU sleep tonight
The brown velvety eyes rested upon him from under their heavy lids with a languorous kindliness
Her warm large palm clasped his in frank liking
I dont want to sleep at all Mr Ware was impelled to say
I want to lie awake and think aboutabout everything all over again
She smiled drowsily
And youre sure you feel strong enough to walk home
Yes he replied with a lingering dilatory note which deepened upon reflection into a sigh
Oh yes
He followed her and her candle down the magnificent stairway again
She blew the light out in the hall and opening the front door stood with him for a silent moment on the threshold
Then they shook hands once more and with a whispered goodnight parted
Celia returning to the blue and yellow room lighted a cigarette and helped herself to some Benedictine in the glass which Theron had used
She looked meditatively at this little glass for a moment turning it about in her fingers with a smile
The smile warmed itself suddenly into a joyous laugh
She tossed the glass aside and holding out her flowing skirts with both hands executed a swinging pirouette in front of the gravely beautiful statue of the armless woman
CHAPTER XX It was apparent to the Rev
Theron Ware from the very first moment of waking next morning that both he and the world had changed over night
The metamorphosis in the harsh toils of which he had been laboring blindly so long was accomplished
He stood forth so to speak in a new skin and looked about him with perceptions of quite an altered kind upon what seemed in every way a fresh existence
He lacked even the impulse to turn round and inspect the cocoon from which he had emerged
Let the past bury the past
He had no vestige of interest in it
The change was not premature
He found himself not in the least confused by it or frightened
Before he had finished shaving he knew himself to be easily and comfortably at home in his new state and master of all its requirements
It seemed as if Alice too recognized that he had become another man when he went down and took his chair at the breakfast table
They had exchanged no words since their parting in the depotyard the previous eveningan event now faded off into remote vagueness in Therons mind
He smiled brilliantly in answer to the furtive halfsullen halfcurious glance she stole at him as she brought the dishes in
Ah
potatoes warmed up in cream
he said with hearty pleasure in his tone
What a mindreader you are to be sure
Im glad youre feeling so much better she said briefly taking her seat
Better
he returned
Im a new being
She ventured to look him over more freely upon this assurance
He perceived and catalogued one by one the emotions which the small brain was expressing through those shallow blue eyes of hers
She was turning over this that and the other hostile thought and childish grievance most of all she was dallying with the idea of asking him where he had been till after midnight
He smiled affably in the face of this scattering fire of peevish glances and did not dream of resenting any phase of them all
I am going down to Thurstons this morning and order that piano sent up today he announced presently in a casual way
Why Theron can we afford it
the wife asked regarding him with surprise
Oh easily enough he replied lightheartedly
You know theyve increased my salary
She shook her head
No I didnt
How should I
You dont realize it she went on dolefully but youre getting so you dont tell me the least thing about your affairs nowadays
Theron laughed aloud
You ought to be grateful such melancholy affairs as mine have been till now he declaredthat is if it werent absurd to think such a thing
Then more soberly he explained No my girl it is you who dont realize
I am carrying big projects in my mindbig ambitious thoughts and plans upon which great things depend
They no doubt make me seem preoccupied and absentminded but it is a wifes part to understand and make allowances and not intrude trifles which may throw everything out of gear
Dont think Im scolding my girl
I only speak to reassure you andand help you to comprehend
Of course I know that you wouldnt willingly embarrass my my career
Of course not responded Alice dubiously butbut  But what
Theron felt compelled by civility to say though on the instant he reproached himself for the weakness of it
WellI hardly know how to say it she faltered but it was nicer in the old days before you bothered your head about big projects and your career as you call it and were just a good earnest simple young servant of the Lord
Oh Theron
she broke forth suddenly with tearful zeal I get sometimes lately almost scared lest you should turn out to be aa BACKSLIDER
The husband sat upright and hardened his countenance
But yesterday the word would have had in it all sorts of inherited terrors for him
This mornings dawn of a new existence revealed it as merely an empty and stupid epithet
These are things not to be said he admonished her after a moments pause and speaking with carefully measured austerity
Least of all are they to be said to a clergymanby his wife
It was on the tip of Alices tongue to retort Better by his wife than by outsiders
but she bit her lips and kept the gibe back
A rebuke of this form and gravity was a novelty in their relations
The fear that it had been merited troubled even while it did not convince her mind and the puzzled apprehension was to be read plainly enough on her face
Theron noting it saw a good deal more behind
Really it was amazing how much wiser he had grown all at once
He had been married for years and it was only this morning that he suddenly discovered how a wife ought to be handled
He continued to look sternly away into space for a little
Then his brows relaxed slowly and under the visible influence of melting considerations
He nodded his head turned toward her abruptly and broke the silence with labored amiability
Come comethe day began so pleasantlyit was so good to feel well againlet us talk about the piano instead
That is he added with an obvious overture to playfulness if the thought of having a piano is not too distasteful to you
Alice yielded almost effusively to his altered mood
They went together into the sittingroom to measure and decide between the two available spaces which were at their disposal and he insisted with resolute magnanimity on her settling this question entirely by herself
When at last he mentioned the fact that it was Friday and he would look over some sermon memoranda before he went out Alice retired to the kitchen in openly cheerful spirits
Theron spread some old manuscript sermons before him on his desk and took down his scribblingbook as well
But there his application flagged and he surrendered himself instead chin on hand to staring out at the rhododendron in the yard
He recalled how he had seen Soulsby patiently studying this identical bush
The notion of Soulsby not knowing at all how to sing yet diligently learning those sixths brought a smile to his mind and then he seemed to hear Celia calling out over her shoulder Thats what Chopin doeshe sings
The spirit of that wonderful music came back to him enfolded him in its wings
It seemed to raise itself up a palpable barrier between him and all that he had known and felt and done before
That was his new birth that marvellous night with the piano
The conceit pleased him not the less because there flashed along with it the thought that it was a poet that had been born
Yes the former country lout the narrow zealot the untutored slave groping about in the dark after silly superstitions cringing at the scowl of mean Pierces and Winches was dead
There was an end of him and good riddance
In his place there had been born a Poethe spelled the word out now unabasheda child of light a lover of beauty and sweet sounds a recognizable brother to Renan and Chopin and Celia
Out of the soothing tenderly grateful revery a practical suggestion suddenly took shape
He acted upon it without a moments delay getting out his letterpad and writing hurriedly Dear Miss MaddenLife will be more tolerable to me if before nightfall I can know that there is a piano under my roof
Even if it remains dumb it will be some comfort to have it here and look at it and imagine how a great master might make it speak
Would it be too much to beg you to look in at Thurstons say at eleven this forenoon and give me the inestimable benefit of your judgment in selecting an instrument
Do not trouble to answer this for I am leaving home now but shall call at Thurstons at eleven and wait
Thanking you in anticipation I am Here Therons fluency came to a sharp halt
There were adverbs enough and to spare on the point of his pen but the right one was not easy to come at
Gratefully faithfully sincerely trulyeach in turn struck a false note
He felt himself not quite any of these things
At last he decided to write just the simple word yours and then wavered between satisfaction at his boldness dread lest he had been overbold and worst of the lot fear that she would not notice it one way or the other all the while he sealed and addressed the letter put it carefully in an inner pocket and got his hat
There was a moments hesitation as to notifying the kitchen of his departure
The interests of domestic discipline seemed to point the other way
He walked softly through the hall and let himself out by the front door without a sound
Down by the canal bridge he picked out an idle boy to his mind a lad whose aspect appeared to promise intelligence as a messenger combined with large impartiality in sectarian matters
He was to have ten cents on his return and he might report himself to his patron at the bookstore yonder
Theron was grateful to the old bookseller for remaining at his desk in the rear
There was a tacit compliment in the suggestion that he was not a mere customer demanding instant attention
Besides there was no keeping Thurstons out of conversations in this place
Loitering along the shelves the young ministers eye suddenly found itself arrested by a name on a cover
There were a dozen narrow volumes in uniform binding huddled together under a cardboard label of Eminent Women Series
Oddly enough one of these bore the title George Sand
Theron saw there must be some mistake as he took the book down and opened it
His glance hit by accident upon the name of Chopin
Then he read attentively until almost the stroke of eleven
We have to make ourselves acquainted with all sorts of queer phases of life he explained in selfdefence to the old bookseller then counting out the money for the book from his lean purse
He smiled as he added There seems something almost wrong about taking advantage of the clergymans discount for a life of George Sand
I dont know answered the other pleasantly
Guess she wasnt so much different from the rest of emexcept that she didnt mind appearances
We know about her
We dont know about the others
I must hurry said Theron turning on his heel
The haste with which he strode out of the store crossed the street and made his way toward Thurstons did not prevent his thinking much upon the astonishing things he had encountered in this book
Their relation to Celia forced itself more and more upon his mind
He could recall the twinkle in her eye the submockery in her tone as she commented with that halfcontemptuous YesGeorge something
upon his blundering ignorance
His mortification at having thus exposed his dull rusticity was swallowed up in conjectures as to just what her tolerant familiarity with such things involved
He had never before met a young unmarried woman who would have confessed to him any such knowledge
But then of course he had never known a girl who resembled Celia in any other way
He recognized vaguely that he must provide himself with an entire new set of standards by which to measure and comprehend her
But it was for the moment more interesting to wonder what her standards were
Did she object to George Sands behavior
Or did she sympathize with that sort of thing
Did those statues and the looseflowing diaphonous toga and unbound hair the cigarettes the fiery liqueur the deliberately sensuous musicwas he to believe that they signified
Goodmorning Mr Ware
You have managed by a miracle to hit on one of my punctual days said Celia
She was standing on the doorstep at the entrance to the musical department of Thurstons
He had not noticed before the fact that the sun was shining
The full glare of its strong light enveloping her figure as she stood and drawing the dazzled eye for relief to the bower of softened color close beneath her parasol of creamy silk and lace was what struck him now first of all
It was as if Celia had brought the sun with her
Theron shook hands with her and found joy in the perception that his own hand trembled
He put boldly into words the thought that came to him
It was generous of you he said to wait for me out here where all might delight in the sight of you instead of squandering the privilege on a handful of clerks inside
Miss Madden beamed upon him and nodded approval
Alcibiades never turned a prettier compliment she remarked
They went in together at this and Theron made a note of the name
During the ensuing halfhour the young minister followed about even more humbly than the clerks in Celias commanding wake
There were a good many pianos in the big showroom overhead and Theron found himself almost awed by their size and brilliancy of polish and the thought of the tremendous sum of money they represented altogether
Not so with the organist
She ordered them rolled around this way or that as if they had been so many checkers on a draughtboard
She threw back their covers with the scant ceremony of a dispensary dentist opening paupers mouths
She exploited their several capacities with masterful hands not deigning to seat herself but just slightly bending forward and sweeping her fingers up and down their keyboardsable domineering fingers which pounded tinkled meditated assented condemned all in a flash and amid what affected the laymans ears as a hopelessly discordant hubbub
Theron moved about in the group nursing her parasol in his arms and watching her
The exaggerated deference which the clerks and salesmen showed to her as the rich Miss Madden seemed to him to be mixed with a certain assertion of the claims of goodfellowship on the score of her being a musician
There undoubtedly was a sense of freemasonry between them
They alluded continually in technical terms to matters of which he knew nothing and were amused at remarks of hers which to him carried no meaning whatever
It was evident that the young men liked her and that their liking pleased her
It thrilled him to think that she knew he liked her too and to recall what abundant proofs she had given that here also she had pleasure in the fact
He clung insistently to the memory of these evidences
They helped him to resist a disagreeable tendency to feel himself an intruder an outsider among these pianoforte experts
When it was all over Celia waved the others aside and talked with Theron
I suppose you want me to tell you the truth she said
Theres nothing here really good
It is always much better to buy of the makers direct
Do they sell on the instalment plan
he asked
There was a wistful effect in his voice which caught her attention
She looked awayout through the window on the street below for a moment
Then her eyes returned to his and regarded him with a comforting friendly halfmotherly glance recalling for all the world the way Sister Soulsby had looked at him at odd times
Oh you want it at onceI see she remarked softly
Well this Adelberger is the best value for the money
Mr Ware followed her finger and beheld with dismay that it pointed toward the largest instrument in the room a veritable leviathan among pianos
The price of this had been mentioned as 600
He turned over the fact that this was twothirds his yearly salary and found the courage to shake his head
It would be too largemuch too largefor the room he explained
And besides it is more than I like to pay or CAN pay for that matter
It was pitiful to be explaining such details but there was no help for it
They picked out a smaller one which Celia said was at least of fair quality
Now leave all the bargaining to me she adjured him
These prices that they talk about in the piano trade are all in the air
There are tremendous discounts if one knows how to insist upon them
All you have to do is to tell them to send it to your house you wanted it today you said
Yesin memory of yesterday he murmured
She herself gave the directions and Thurstons people now all salesmen again bowed grateful acquiescence
Then she sailed regally across the room and down the stairs drawing Theron in her train
The hirelings made salaams to him as well it would have been impossible to interpose anything so trivial and squalid as talk about terms and dates of payment
I am ever so much obliged to you he said fervently in the comparative solitude of the lower floor
She had paused to look at something in the bookdepartment
Of course I was entirely at your service dont mention it she replied reaching forth her hand in an absent way for her parasol
He held up instead the volume he had purchased
Guess what that is
You never would guess in this wide world
His manner was surcharged with a sense of the surreptitious
Well then theres no good trying IS there
commented Celia her glance roving again toward the shelves
It is a life of George Sand whispered Theron
Ive been reading it this morningall the Chopin part while I was waiting for you
To his surprise there was an apparently displeased contraction of her brows as he made this revelation
For the instant a dreadful fear of having offended her seized upon and sickened him
But then her face cleared as by magic
She smiled and let her eyes twinkle in laughter at him and lifted a forefinger in the most winning mockery of admonition
Naughty
naughty
she murmured back with a roguishly solemn wink
He had no response ready for this but mutely handed her the parasol
The situation had suddenly grown too confused for words or even sequent thoughts
Uppermost across the hurlyburly of his mind there scudded the singular reflection that he should never hear her play on that new piano of his
Even as it flashed by out of sight he recognized it for one of the griefs of his life and the darkness which followed seemed nothing but a revolt against the idea of having a piano at all
He would countermand the order
He would but she was speaking again
They had strolled toward the door and her voice was as placidly conventional as if the talk had never strayed from the subject of pianos
Theron with an effort pulled himself together and laid hold of her words
I suppose you will be going the other way she was saying
I shall have to be at the church all day
We have just got a new Mass over from Vienna and Im head over heels in work at it
I can have Father Forbes to myself today too
That bear of a doctor has got the rheumatism and cant come out of his cave thank Heaven
And then she was receding from view up the sunlit busy sidewalk and Theron standing on the doorstep ruefully rubbed his chin
She had said he was going the other way and after a little pause he made her words good though each step he took seemed all in despite of his personal inclinations
Some of the passersby bowed to him and one or two paused as if to shake hands and exchange greetings
He nodded responses mechanically but did not stop
It was as if he feared to interrupt the process of lifting his reluctant feet and propelling them forward lest they should wheel and scuttle off in the opposite direction
CHAPTER XXI Deliberate as his progress was the diminishing number of storefronts along the sidewalk and the increasing proportion of picketfences enclosing domestic lawns forced upon Therons attention the fact that he was nearing home
It was a trifle past the hour for his midday meal
He was not in the least hungry still less did he feel any desire just now to sit about in that library livingroom of his
Why should he go home at all
There was no reason whateversave that Alice would be expecting him
Upon reflection that hardly amounted to a reason
Wives with their limited grasp of the realities of life were always expecting their husbands to do things which it turned out not to be feasible for them to do
The customary male animal spent a considerable part of his life in explaining to his mate why it had been necessary to disappoint or upset her little plans for his comings and goings
It was in the very nature of things that it should be so
Sustained by these considerations Mr Ware slackened his steps then halted irresolutely and after a minutes hesitation entered the small temperance restaurant before which as by intuition he had paused
The elderly woman who placed on the tiny table before him the tea and rolls he ordered was entirely unknown to him he felt sure yet none the less she smiled at him and spoke almost familiarlyI suppose Mrs Ware is at the seaside and you are keeping bachelors hall
Not quite that he responded stiffly and hurried through the meagre and distasteful repast to avoid any further conversation
There was an idea underlying her remark however which recurred to him when he had paid his ten cents and got out on the street again
There was something interesting in the thought of Alice at the seaside
Neither of them had ever laid eyes on salt water but Theron took for granted the most extravagant landsmans conception of its curative and invigorating powers
It was apparent to him that he was going to pay much greater attention to Alices happiness and wellbeing in the future than he had latterly done
He had bought her this very day a superb new piano
He was going to simply insist on her having a hired girl
And this seaside notionwhy that was best of all
His fancy built up pleasant visions of her feasting her delighted eyes upon the marvel of a great ocean storm or roaming along a beach strewn with wonderful marine shells exhibiting an innocent joy in their beauty
The fresh seabreeze blew through her hair as he saw her in minds eye and brought the hardy flush of health back upon her rather pallid cheeks
He was prepared already hardly to know her so robust and revivified would she have become by the time he went down to the depot to meet her on her return
For his imagination stopped short of seeing himself at the seaside
It sketched instead pictures of whole weeks of solitary academic calm alone with his books and his thoughts
The facts that he had no books and that nobody dreamed of interfering with his thoughts subordinated themselves humbly to his mood
The prospect as he mused fondly upon it expanded to embrace the priests and the doctors libraries the thoughts which he longed to be alone with involved close communion with their thoughts
It could not but prove a season of immense mental stimulation and ethical broadening
It would have its lofty poetic and artistic side as well the languorous melodies of Chopin stole over his revery as he dwelt upon these things and soft azure and golden lights modelled forth the exquisite outlines of tall marble forms
He opened the gate leading to Dr Ledsmars house
His walk had brought him quite out of the town and up by a broad main highway which yet took on all sorts of sylvan charms to a commanding site on the hillside
Below in the valley lay Octavius at one end halfhidden in factory smoke at the other where narrow bands of water gleamed upon the surface of a broad plain piled symmetrically with lumber presenting an oddly incongruous suggestion of forest odors and the simplicity of the wilderness
In the middle distance on gradually rising ground stretched a wide belt of dense artificial foliage peeping through which tiled turrets and ornamented chimneys marked the polite residences of those who though they neither stoked the furnace fires to the west nor sawed the lumber on the east lived in purple and fine linen from the profits of this toil
Nearer at hand pastures with grazing cows on the one side of the road and the nigh weatherstained board fence of the racecourse on the other completed the jumble of primitive rusticity and urban complications characterizing the whole picture
Dr Ledsmars house toward which Therons impulses had been secretly leading him ever since Celias parting remark about the rheumatism was of that spacious and satisfying order of oldfashioned houses which men of leisure and means built for themselves while the early traditions of a sparse and contented homogeneous population were still strong in the Republic
There was a hospitable look about its wide veranda its broad low bulk and its big double front door which did not fit at all with the sketch of a manhating recluse that the doctor had drawn of himself
Theron had prepared his mind for the effect of being admitted by a Chinaman and was taken somewhat aback when the door was opened by the doctor himself
His reception was pleasant enough almost cordial but the sense of awkwardness followed him into his hosts inner room and rested heavily upon his opening speech
I heard quite by accident that you were ill he said laying aside his hat
Its nothing at all replied Ledsmar
Merely a stiff shoulder that I wear from time to time in memory of my father
It ought to be quite gone by nightfall
It was good of you to come all the same
Sit down if you can find a chair
As usual we are littered up to our eyes here
Thats it throw those things on the floor
Mr Ware carefully deposited an armful of pamphlets on the rug at his feet and sat down
Litter was indeed the word for what he saw about him
Bookcases chairs tables the corners of the floor were all buried deep under disorderly strata of papers diagrams and opened books
One could hardly walk about without treading on them
The dust which danced up into the bar of sunshine streaming in from the window as the doctor stepped across to another chair gave Theron new ideas about the value of Chinese servants
I must thank you first of all doctor he began for your kindness in coming when I was ill I was sick and ye visited me
You mustnt think of it that way said Ledsmar your friend came for me and of course I went and gladly too
There was nothing that I could do or that anybody could do
Very interesting man that friend of yours
And his wife tooboth quite out of the common
I dont know when Ive seen two such really genuine people
I should like to have known more of them
Are they still here
They went yesterday Theron replied
His earlier shyness had worn off and he felt comfortably at his ease
I dont know he went on that the word genuine is just what would have occurred to me to describe the Soulsbys
The are very interesting people as you say MOST interestingand there was a time l dare say when I should have believed in their sincerity
But of course I saw them and their performance from the inside like one on the stage of a theatre you know instead of in the audience andwell I understand things better than I used to
The doctor looked over his spectacles at him with a suggestion of inquiry in his glance and Theron continued I had several long talks with her she told me very frankly the whole story of her lifeand and it was decidedly queer I can assure you
I may say to you you will understand what I meanthat since my talk with you and the books you lent me I see many things differently
Indeed when I think upon it sometimes my old state of mind seems quite incredible to me
I can use no word for my new state short of illumination
Dr Ledsmar continued to regard his guest with that calm interrogatory scrutiny of his
He did not seem disposed to take up the great issue of illumination
I suppose he said after a little no woman can come in contact with a priest for any length of time WITHOUT telling him the story of her life as you call it
They all do it
The thing amounts to a law
The young ministers veins responded with a pleasurable thrill to the use of the word priest in obvious allusion to himself
Perhaps in fairness I ought to explain he said that in her case it was only done in the course of a long talk about myself
I might say that it was by way of kindly warning to me
She saw how I had become unsettled in manymany of my former views and she was nervous lest this should lead me toto To throw up the priesthood the doctor interposed upon his hesitation
Yes I know the tribe
Why my dear sir your entire profession would have perished from the memory of mankind if it hadnt been for women
It is a very curious subject
Lots of thinkers have dipped into it but no one has gone resolutely in with a searchlight and exploited the whole thing
Our boys for instance traverse in their younger years all the stages of the childhood of the race
They have terrifying dreams of awful monsters and giant animals of which they have never so much as heard in their waking hours they pass through the lust for digging caves building fires sleeping out in the woods hunting with bows and arrows all remote ancestral impulses they play games with stones marbles and so on at regular stated periods of the year which they instinctively know just as they were played in the Bronze Age and heaven only knows how much earlier
But the boy goes through all this and leaves it behind him so completely that the grown man feels himself more a stranger among boys of his own place who are thinking and doing precisely the things he thought and did a few years before than he would among Kurds or Esquimaux
But the woman is totally different
She is infinitely more precocious as a girl
At an age when her slow brother is still stubbing along somewhere in the neolithic period she has flown way ahead to a kind of mediaeval stage or dawn of mediaevalism which is peculiarly her own
Having got there she stays there she dies there
The boy passes her as the tortoise did the hare
He goes on if he is a philosopher and lets her remain in the dark ages where she belongs
If he happens to be a fool which is customary he stops and hangs around in her vicinity
Theron smiled
We priests he said and paused again to enjoy the wordsI suppose I oughtnt to inquire too closely just where we belong in the procession
We are considering the question impersonally said the doctor
First of all what you regard as religion is especially calculated to attract women
They remain as superstitious today down in the marrow of their bones as they were ten thousand years ago
Even the cleverest of them are secretly afraid of omens and respect auguries
Think of the broadest women you know
One of them will throw salt over her shoulder if she spills it
Another drinks money from her cup by skimming the bubbles in a spoon
Another forecasts her future by the arrangement of teagrounds
They make the constituency to which an institution based on mysteries miracles and the supernatural generally would naturally appeal
Secondly there is the personality of the priest
Yes assented Ware
There rose up before him on the instant the graceful portly figure and strong comely face of Father Forbes
Women are not a metaphysical people
They do not easily follow abstractions
They want their dogmas and religious sentiments embodied in a man just as they do their romantic fancies
Of course you Protestants with your married clergy see less of the effects of this than celibates do but even with you there is a great deal in it
Why the very institution of celibacy itself was forced upon the early Christian Church by the scandal of rich Roman ladies loading bishops and handsome priests with fabulous gifts until the passion for currying favor with women of wealth and marrying them or wheedling their fortunes from them debauched the whole priesthood
You should read your Jerome
I willcertainly said the listener resolving to remember the name and refer it to the old bookseller
Well whatever laws one sect or another makes the womans attitude toward the priest survives
She desires to see him surrounded by flowerpots and candles to have him smelling of musk
She would like to curl his hair and weave garlands in it
Although she is not learned enough to have ever heard of such things she intuitively feels in his presence a sort of backwash of the old pagan sensuality and lascivious mysticism which enveloped the priesthood in Greek and Roman days
Ugh
It makes one sick
Dr Ledsmar rose as he spoke and dismissed the topic with a dry little laugh
Come let me show you round a bit he said
My shoulder is easier walking than sitting
Have you never written a book yourself
asked Theron getting to his feet
I have a thing on serpentworship the scientist repliedwritten years ago
I cant tell you how I should enjoy reading it urged the other
The doctor laughed again
Youll have to learn German then I m afraid
It is still in circulation in Germany I believe on its merits as a serious book
I havent a copy of the edition in English
THAT was all exhausted by collectors who bought it for its supposed obscenity like Burtons Arabian Nights
Come this way and I will show you my laboratory
They moved out of the room and through a passage Ledsmar talking as he led the way
I took up that subject when I was at college by a curious chance
I kept a young monkey in my rooms which had been born in captivity
I brought home from a beer hallit was in Germany some pretzels one night and tossed one toward the monkey
He jumped toward it then screamed and ran back shuddering with fright
I couldnt understand it at first
Then I saw that the curled pretzel lying there on the floor was very like a little coiledup snake
The monkey had never seen a snake but it was in his blood to be afraid of one
That incident changed my whole life for me
Up to that evening I had intended to be a lawyer
Theron did not feel sure that he had understood the point of the anecdote
He looked now without much interest at some dark little tanks containing thick water a row of small glass cases with adders and other lesser reptiles inside and a general collection of boxes jars and similar receptacles connected with the doctors pursuits
Further on was a smaller chamber with a big empty furnace and shelves bearing bottles and apparatus like a drugstore
It was pleasanter in the conservatorya low spacious structure with broad pathways between the plants and an awning over the sunny side of the roof
The plants were mostly orchids he learned
He had read of them but never seen any before
No doubt they were curious but he discovered nothing to justify the great fuss made about them
The heat grew oppressive inside and he was glad to emerge into the garden
He paused under the grateful shade of a vineclad trellis took off his hat and looked about him with a sigh of relief
Everything seemed oldfashioned and natural and delightfully free from pretence in the big overgrown field of flowers and shrubs
Theron recalled with some surprise Celias indictment of the doctor as a man with no poetry in his soul
You must be extremely fond of flowers he remarked
Dr Ledsmar shrugged his well shoulder
They have their points he said briefly
These are all dioecious here
Over beyond are monoecious species
My work is to test the probabilities for or against Darwins theory that hermaphroditism in plants is a late byproduct of these earlier forms
And is his theory right
asked Mr Ware with a polite show of interest
We may know in the course of three or four hundred years replied Ledsmar
He looked up into his guests face with a quizzical halfsmile
That is a very brief period for observation when such a complicated question as sex is involved he added
We have been studying the female of our own species for some hundreds of thousands of years and we havent arrived at the most elementary rules governing her actions
They had moved along to a bed of tall plants the more forward of which were beginning to show bloom
Here another task will begin next month the doctor observed
These are salvias pentstemons and antirrhinums or snapdragons planted very thick for the purpose
Humblebees bore holes through their base to save the labor of climbing in and out of the flowers and we dont quite know yet why some hivebees discover and utilize these holes at once while others never do
It may be merely the oldfogy conservatism of the individual or there may be a law in it
These seemed very paltry things for a man of such wisdom to bother his head about
Theron looked as he was bidden at the rows of hives shining in the hot sun on a bench along the wall but offered no comment beyond a casual My mother was always going to keep bees but somehow she never got around to it
They say it pays very well though
The discovery of the reason why no bee will touch the nectar of the EPIPACTIS LATIFOLIA though it is sweet to our taste and wasps are greedy for it WOULD pay commented the doctor
Not like a blue rhododendron in mere money but in recognition
Lots of men have achieved a halfcolumn in the Encyclopedia Britannica on a smaller basis than that
They stood now at the end of the garden before a small dilapidated summerhouse
On the bench inside facing him Theron saw a strange recumbent figure stretched at full length apparently sound asleep or it might be dead
Looking closer with a startled surprise he made out the shaven skull and outlandish garb of a Chinaman
He turned toward his guide in the expectation of a scene
The doctor had already taken out a notebook and pencil and was drawing his watch from his pocket
He stepped into the summerhouse and lifting the Orientals limp arm took account of his pulse
Then with head bowed low sidewise he listened for the heartaction
Finally he somewhat brusquely pushed back one of the Chinamans eyelids and made a minute inspection of what the operation disclosed
Returning to the light he inscribed some notes in his book put it back in his pocket and came out
In answer to Therons marvelling stare he pointed toward a pipe of odd construction lying on the floor beneath the sleeper
This is one of my regular afternoon duties he explained again with the whimsical halfsmile
I am increasing his dose monthly by regular stages and the results promise to be rather remarkable
Heretofore observations have been made mostly on diseased or morbidly deteriorated subjects
This fellow of mine is strong as an ox perfectly nourished and watched over intelligently
He can assimilate opium enough to kill you and me and every other vertebrate creature on the premises without turning a hair and he hasnt got even fairly under way yet
The thing was unpleasant and the young minister turned away
They walked together up the path toward the house
His mind was full now of the hostile things which Celia had said about the doctor
He had vaguely sympathized with her then upon no special knowledge of his own
Now he felt that his sentiments were vehemently in accord with hers
The doctor WAS a beast
And yetas they moved slowly along through the garden the thought took sudden shape in his mindit would be only justice for him to get also the doctors opinion of Celia
Even while they offended and repelled him he could not close his eyes to the fact that the doctors experiments and occupations were those of a patient and exact man of sciencea philosopher
And what he had said about womenthere was certainly a great deal of acumen and shrewd observation in that
If he would only say what he really thought about Celia and about her relations with the priest
Yes Theron recognized now there was nothing else that he so much needed light upon as those puzzling ties between Celia and Father Forbes
He paused with a simulated curiosity about one of the flowerbeds
Speaking of women and religion he began in as casual a tone as he could command I notice curiously enough in my own case that as I develop in what you may call thethe other direction my wife who formerly was not especially devote is being strongly attracted by the most unthinking and hysterical side of of our church system
The doctor looked at him nodded and stooped to nip some buds from a stalk in the bed
And another case Theron went onof course it was all so new and strange to mebut the position which Miss Madden seems to occupy about the Catholic Church here I suppose you had her in mind when you spoke
Ledsmar stood up
My mind has better things to busy itself with than mad asses of that description he replied
She is not worth talking abouta mere bundle of egotism ignorance and redheaded lewdness
If she were even a type she might be worth considering but she is simply an abnormal sport with a little brain addled by notions that she is like Hypatia and a large impudence rendered intolerable by the fact that she has money
Her father is a decent man
He ought to have her whipped
Mr Ware drew himself erect as he listened to these outrageous words
It would be unmanly he felt to allow such comments upon an absent friend to pass unrebuked
Yet there was the courtesy due to a host to be considered
His mind fluttering between these two extremes alighted abruptly upon a compromise
He would speak so as to show his disapproval yet not so as to prevent his finding out what he wanted to know
The desire to hear Ledsmar talk about Celia and the priest seemed now to have possessed him for a long time to have dictated his unpremeditated visit out here to have been growing in intensity all the while he pretended to be interested in orchids and bees and the drugged Chinaman
It tugged passionately at his selfcontrol as he spoke
I cannot in the least assent to your characterization of the lady he began with rhetorical dignity
Bless me
interposed the doctor with deceptive cheerfulness that is not required of you at all
It is a strictly personal opinion offered merely as a contribution to the general sum of hypotheses
But Theron went on feeling his way of course I gathered that evening that you had prejudices in the matter but these are rather apart from the point I had in view
We were speaking you will remember of the traditional attitude of women toward priestswanting to curl their hair and put flowers in it you know and that suggested to me some individual illustrations and it occurred to me to wonder just what were the relations between Miss Madden andand Father Forbes
She said this morning for instanceI happened to meet her quite by accident that she was going to the church to practise a new piece and that she could have Father Forbes to herself all day
Now that would be quite an impossible remark in ourthat is in any Protestant circlesand purely as a matter of comparison I was curious to ask you just how much there was in it
I ask you because going there so much you have had exceptional opportunities for A sharp exclamation from his companion interrupted the clergymans hesitating monologue
It began like a highpitched violent word but dwindled suddenly into a groan of pain
The doctors face too which had on the flash of Therons turning seemed given over to unmixed anger took on an expression of bodily suffering instead
My shoulder has grown all at once excessively painful he said hastily
Im afraid I must ask you to excuse me Mr
Ware
Carrying the afflicted side with ostentatious caution he led the way without ado round the house to the front gate on the road
He had put his left hand under his coat to press it against his aching shoulder and his right hung palpably helpless
This rendered it impossible for him to shake hands with his guest in parting
Youre sure theres nothing I can do said Theron lingering on the outer side of the gate
I used to rub my fathers shoulders and back Id gladly Oh not for worlds
groaned the doctor
His anguish was so impressive that Theron as he walked down the road quite missed the fact that there had been no invitation to come again
Dr Ledsmar stood for a minute or two his gaze meditatively following the retreating figure
Then he went in opening the front door with his right hand and carrying himself once more as if there were no such thing as rheumatism in the world
He wandered on through the hall into the laboratory and stopped in front of the row of little tanks full of water
Some deliberation was involved in whatever his purpose might be for he looked from one tank to another with a pondering dilatory gaze
At last he plunged his hand into the opaque fluid and drew forth a long slim yellowishgreen lizard with a coiling sinuous tail and a pointed evil head
The reptile squirmed and doubled itself backward around his wrist darting out and in with dizzy swiftness its tiny forked tongue
The doctor held the thing up to the light and scrutinizing it through his spectacles nodded his head in sedate approval
A grim smile curled in his beard
Yes you are the type he murmured to it with evident enjoyment in the conceit
Your name isnt Johnny any more
Its the Rev
Theron Ware
CHAPTER XXII The annual campmeeting of the combined Methodist districts of Octavius and Thessaly was held this year in the second half of September a little later than usual
Of the nine days devoted to this curious survival of primitive Wesleyanism the fifth fell upon a Saturday
On the noon of that day the Rev
Theron Ware escaped for some hours from the burden of work and incessant observation which he shared with twenty other preachers and walked alone in the woods
The scene upon which he turned his back was one worth looking at
A spacious irregularly defined clearing in the forest lay level as a tenniscourt under the soft haze of autumn sunlight
In the centre was a large roughly constructed frame building untouched by paint but stained and weatherbeaten with time
Behind it were some lines of horsesheds and still further on in that direction where the trees began the eye caught fragmentary glimpses of low roofs and the fronts of tiny cottages withdrawn from full view among the saplings and underbrush
At the other side of the clearing fully fourscore tents were pitched some gray and mended others dazzlingly white in their newness
The more remote of these tents fell into an orderly arrangement of semicircular form facing that part of the engirdling woods where the trees were largest and their canopy of overhanging foliage was lifted highest from the ground
Inside this halfring of tents were many rounded rows of benches which followed in narrowing lines the idea of an amphitheatre cut in two
In the centre just under the edge of the roof of boughs rose a wooden pagoda in form not unlike an openair stand for musicians
In front of this and leading from it on the level of its floor there projected a platform railed round with aggressively rustic woodwork
The nearest benches came close about this platform
At the hour when Theron started away there were few enough signs of life about this encampment
The four or five hundred people who were in constant residence were eating their dinners in the big boardinghouse or the cottages or the tents
It was not the time of day for strangers
Even when services were in progress by daylight the regular attendants did not make much of a show huddled in a grayblack mass at the front of the auditorium by comparison with the great green and blue expanses of nature about them
The real spectacle was in the evening when as the shadows gathered big clusters of kerosene torches hung on the trees facing the audience were lighted
The falling darkness magnified the glow of the lights and the size and importance of what they illumined
The preacher bending forward over the rails of the platform and fastening his eyes upon the abashed faces of those on the anxious seat beneath him borrowed an effect of druidical mystery from the wall of blackness about him from the flickering reflections on the branches far above from the cool night air which stirred across the clearing
The change was in the blood of those who saw and heard him too
The decorum and halfheartedness of their devotions by day deepened under the glare of the torches into a fervent enthusiasm even before the services began
And if there was in the rustic pulpit a man whose prayers or exhortations could stir their pulses they sang and groaned and bellowed out their praises with an almost barbarous license such as befitted the wilderness
But in the evening not all were worshippers
For a dozen miles round on the countryside young farmworkers and their girls regarded the campmeeting as perhaps the chief event of the yearno more to be missed than the country fair or the circus and offering from many points of view more opportunities for genuine enjoyment than either
Their behavior when they came was pretty badnot the less so because all the rules established by the Presiding Elders for the regulation of strangers took it for granted that they would act as viciously as they knew how
These sightseers sometimes ventured to occupy the back benches where the light was dim
More often they stood outside in the circular space between the tents and the benches and mingled catcalls drovers yelps and all sorts of mocking cries and noises with the Amens of the earnest congregation
Their rough horseplay on the fringe of the sanctified gathering was grievous enough everybody knew that much worse things went on further out in the surrounding darkness
Indeed popular report gave to these external phases of the campmeeting an even more evil fame than attached to the later moonlight huskingbees or the least reputable of the midwinter dances at Dave Randalls low halfway house
Cynics said that the Methodists found consolation for this scandal in the large income they derived from their unruly visitors gatemoney
This was unfair
No doubt the money played its part but there was something else far more important
The pious dwellers in the camp intent upon reviving in their poor modern way the character and environment of the heroic early days felt the need of just this hostile and scoffing mob about them to bring out the spirit they sought
Theirs was preeminently a fighting religion which languished in peaceful fair weather but flamed high in the storm
The throng of loafers and lightminded worldlings of both sexes with their jeering interruptions and lewd levity of conduct brought upon the scene a kind of visible personal devil with whom the chosen could do battle face to face
The daylight services became more and more perfunctory as the sojourn in the woods ran its course and interest concentrated itself upon the night meetings for the reason that THEN came the fierce wrestle with a Beelzebub of flesh and blood
And it was not so onesided a contest either
No evening passed without its victories for the pulpit
Careless or mischievous young people who were pushed into the foremost ranks of the mockers and stood grinning and grimacing under the lights would of a sudden feel a spell clamped upon them
They would hear a strange quavering note in the preachers voice catch the sense of a piercing soulcommanding gleam in his eye not at all to be resisted
These occult forces would take control of them drag them forward as in a dream to the benches under the pulpit and abase them there like worms in the dust
And then the preacher would descend and the elders advance and the torchfires would sway and dip before the wind of the mighty roar that went up in triumph from the brethren
These combats with Satan at close quarters if they made the weekday evenings exciting reacted with an effect of crushing dulness upon the Sunday services
The rule was to admit no strangers to the grounds from Saturday night to Monday morning
Every year attempts were made to rescind or modify this rule and this season at least threefourths of the laymen in attendance had signed a petition in favor of opening the gates
The two Presiding Elders supported by a dozen of the older preachers resisted the change and they had the backing of the more bigoted section of the congregation from Octavius
The controversy reached a point where Therons Presiding Elder threatened to quit the grounds and the leaders of the openSunday movement spoke freely of the ridiculous figure which its cranks and fanatics made poor Methodism cut in the eyes of modern goahead American civilization
Then Theron Ware saw his opportunity and preached an impromptu sermon upon the sanctity of the Sabbath which ended all discussion
Sometimes its arguments seemed to be on one side sometimes on the other but always they were clothed with so serene a beauty of imagery and moved in such a lofty and rarefied atmosphere of spiritual exaltation that it was impossible to link them to so sordid a thing as this question of gatemoney
When he had finished nobody wanted the gates opened
The two factions found that the difference between them had melted out of existence
They sat entranced by the charm of the sermon then glancing around at the empty benches glaringly numerous in the afternoon sunlight they whispered regrets that ten thousand people had not been there to hear that marvellous discourse
Therons conquest was of exceptional dimensions
The majority whose project he had defeated were strangers who appreciated and admired his effort most
The little minority of his own flock though less susceptible to the influence of graceful diction and delicately balanced rhetoric were proud of the distinction he had reflected upon them and delighted with him for having won their fight
The Presiding Elders wrung his hand with a significant grip
The extremists of his own charge beamed friendship upon him for the first time
He was the veritable hero of the week
The prestige of this achievement made it the easier for Theron to get away by himself next day and walk in the woods
A man of such power had a right to solitude
Those who noted his departure from the camp remembered with pleasure that he was to preach again on the morrow
He was going to commune with God in the depths of the forest that the Message next day might be clearer and more luminous still
Theron strolled for a little with an air of aimlessness until he was well outside the more or less frequented neighborhood of the camp
Then he looked at the sun and the lay of the land with that informing scrutiny of which the farmbred boy never loses the trick turned and strode at a rattling pace down the hillside
He knew nothing personally of this piece of woodland a spur of the great Adirondack wilderness thrust southward into the region of homesteads and dairies and hopfields but he had prepared himself by a study of the map and he knew where he wanted to go
Very Soon he hit upon the path he had counted upon finding and at this he quickened his gait
Three months of the new life had wrought changes in Theron
He bore himself more erectly for one thing his shoulders were thrown back and seemed thicker
The alteration was even more obvious in his face
The effect of lank wistful sallow juvenility had vanished
It was the countenance of a mature wellfed and confident man firmer and more rounded in its outlines and with a glow of health on its whole surface
Under the chin were the suggestions of fulness which bespeak an easy mind
His clothes were new the frockcoat fitted him and the thin darkcolored autumn overcoat with its silk lining exposed at the breast gave a masculine bulk and shape to his figure
He wore a shining tall hat and in haste though he was took pains not to knock it against lowhanging branches
All had gone wellmore than wellwith him
The second Quarterly Conference had passed without a ripple
Both the attendance and the collections at his church were larger than ever before and the tone of the congregation toward him was altered distinctly for the better
As for himself he viewed with astonished delight the progress he had made in his own estimation
He had taken Sister Soulsbys advice and the results were already wonderful
He had put aside once and for all the thousand foolish trifles and childish perplexities which formerly had racked his brain and worried him out of sleep and strength
He borrowed all sorts of books boldly now from the Octavius public library and could swim with a calm mastery and enjoyment upon the deep waters into which Draper and Lecky and Laing and the rest had hurled him
He dallied pleasurably a little languorously with a dozen aspects of the case against revealed religion ranging from the mild heterodoxy of Andovers qualms to the rude Ingersolls rollicking negation of God himself as a woman of coquetry might play with as many wouldbe lovers
They amused him they were all before him to choose and he was free to postpone indefinitely the act of selection
There was a sense of the luxurious in this position which softened bodily as well as mental fibres
He ceased to grow indignant at things below or outside his standards and he bought a small book which treated of the care of the hand and finger nails
Alice had accepted with deference his explanation that shapely hands played so important a part in pulpit oratory
For that matter she now accepted whatever he said or did with admirable docility
It was months since he could remember her venturing upon a critical attitude toward him
She had not wished to leave home for the seaside or any other resort during the summer but had worked outside in her garden more than usual
This was inexpensive and it seemed to do her as much good as a holiday could have done
Her new devotional zeal was now quite an odd thing it had not slackened at all from the revival pitch
At the outset she had tried several times to talk with her husband upon this subject
He had discouraged conversation about her soul and its welfare at first obliquely then under compulsion with some directness
His thoughts were absorbed he said by the contemplation of vast abstract schemes of creation and the government of the universe and it only diverted and embarrassed his mind to try to fasten it upon the details of personal salvation
Thereafter the topic was not broached between them
She bestowed a good deal of attention too upon her piano
The knack of a girlish nimbleness of touch had returned to her after a few weeks and she made music which Theron supposed was very goodfor her
It pleased him at all events when he sat and listened to it but he had a far greater pleasure as he listened in dwelling upon the memories of the yellow and blue room which the sounds always brought up
Although three months had passed Thurstons had never asked for the first payment on the piano or even sent in a bill
This impressed him as being peculiarly graceful behavior on his part and he recognized its delicacy by not going near Thurstons at all
An hours sharp walk occasionally broken by short cuts across open pastures but for the most part on forest paths brought Theron to the brow of a small knoll free from underbrush and covered sparsely with beechtrees
The ground was soft with moss and the powdered remains of last years foliage the leaves above him were showing the first yellow stains of autumn
A sweet smell of ripening nuts was thick upon the air and busy rustlings and chirpings through the stillness told how the chipmunks and squirrels were attending to their harvest
Theron had no ears for these noises of the woodland
He had halted and was searching through the little vistas offered between the stout gray trunks of the beeches for some sign of a more sophisticated sort
Yes
there were certainly voices to be heard down in the hollow
And now beyond all possibility of mistake there came up to him the low rhythmic throb of music
It was the merest faint murmur of music made up almost wholly of groaning bass notes but it was enough
He moved down the slope swiftly at first then with increasing caution
The sounds grew louder as he advanced until he could hear the harmony of the other strings in its place beside the uproar of the big fiddles and distinguish from both the measured noise of many feet moving as one
He reached a place from which himself unobserved he could overlook much of what he had come to see
The bottom of the glade below him lay out in the full sunshine as flat and as velvety in its fresh greenness as a garden lawn
Its open expanse was big enough to accommodate several distinct crowds and here the crowds wereone massed about an enclosure in which young men were playing at football another gathered further off in a horseshoe curve at the end of a baseball diamond and a third thronging at a point where the shade of overhanging woods began focussed upon a centre of interest which Theron could not make out
Closer at hand where a shallow stream rippled along over its blackslate bed some little boys with legs bared to the thighs were paddling about under the charge of two men clad in long black gowns
There were others of these frocked monitors scattered here and there upon the scenepallid closeshaven monkish figures who none the less wore modern hats and superintended with knowledge the games of the period
Theron remembered that these were the Christian Brothers the semimonastic teachers of the Catholic school
And this was the picnic of the Catholics of Octavius
He gazed in mingled amazement and exhilaration upon the spectacle
There seemed to be literally thousands of people on the open fields before him and apparently there were still other thousands in the fringes of the woods round about
The noises which arose from this multitude the shouts of the lads in the water the playful squeals of the girls in the swings the fused uproar of the more distant crowds and above all the diligent ordered strains of the dancemusic proceeding from some invisible distance in the greenwoodcharmed his ears with their suggestion of universal merriment
He drew a long breathhalf pleasure half wistful regret as he remembered that other gathering in the forest which he had left behind
At any rate it should be well behind him today whatever the morrow might bring
Evidently he was on the wrong side of the circle for the headquarters of the festivities
He turned and walked to the right through the beeches making a detour under cover of the crowds at play
At last he rounded the long oval of the clearing and found himself at the very edge of that largest throng of all which had been too far away for comprehension at the beginning
There was no mystery now
A rough narrow shed fully fifty feet in length imposed itself in an arbitrary line across the face of this crowd dividing it into two compact halves
Inside this shed protected all round by a waisthigh barrier of boards on top of which ran a flat tablelike covering were twenty men in their shirtsleeves toiling ceaselessly to keep abreast of the crowds thirst for beer
The actions of these bartenders greatly impressed Theron
They moved like so many machines using one hand apparently to take money and give change and with the other incessantly sweeping off rows of empty glasses and tossing forward in their place fresh foaming glasses five at a time
Hundreds of arms and hands were continually stretched out on both sides of the shed toward this streaming bar and through the babel of eager cries rose without pause the racket of mallets tapping new kegs
Theron had never seen any considerable number of his fellowcitizens engaged in drinking lager beer before
His surprise at the facility of those behind the bar began to yield upon observation to a profound amazement at the thirst of those before it
The same people seemed to be always in front emptying the glasses faster than the busy men inside could replenish them and clamoring tirelessly for more
Newcomers had to force their way to the bar by violent efforts and once there they stayed until pushed bodily aside
There were actually women to be seen here and there in the throng elbowing and shoving like the rest for a place at the front
Some of the more gallant young men fought their way outward from time to time carrying for safety above their heads glasses of beer which they gave to young and pretty girls standing on the fringe of the crowd among the trees
Everywhere a remarkable goodhumor prevailed
Once a sharp fight broke out just at the end of the bar nearest Theron and one young man was knocked down
A rush of the onlookers confused everything before the ministers eyes for a minute and then he saw the aggrieved combatant up on his legs again consenting under the kindly pressure of the crowd to shake hands with his antagonist and join him in more beer
The incident caught his fancy
There was something very pleasingly human he thought in this primitive readiness to resort to fisticuffs and this frank and genial reconciliation
Perhaps there was something contagious in this wholesale display of thirst for the Rev
Mr Ware became conscious of a notion that he should like to try a glass of beer
He recalled having heard that lager was really a most harmless beverage
Of course it was out of the question that he should show himself at the bar
Perhaps some one would bring him out a glass as if he were a pretty girl
He looked about for a possible messenger
Turning he found himself face to face with two smiling people into whose eyes he stared for an instant in dumfounded blankness
Then his countenance flashed with joy and he held out both hands in greeting
It was Father Forbes and Celia
We stole down upon you unawares said the priest in his cheeriest manner
He wore a brown straw hat and loose clothes hardly at all clerical in form and had Miss Maddens arm drawn lightly within his own
We could barely believe our eyesthat it could be you whom we saw here among the sinners
I am in love with your sinners responded Theron as he shook hands with Celia and trusted himself to look fully into her eyes
Ive had five days of the saints over in another part of the woods and theyve bored the head off me
CHAPTER XXIII At the command of Father Forbes a lad who was loitering near them went down through the throng to the bar and returned with three glasses of beer
It pleased the Rev
Mr Ware that the priest should have taken it for granted that he would do as the others did
He knocked his glass against theirs in compliance with a custom strange to him but which they seemed to understand very well
The beer itself was not so agreeable to the taste as he had expected but it was cold and refreshing
When the boy had returned with the glasses the three stood for a moment in silence meditatively watching the curious scene spread below them
Beyond the bar Theron could catch now through the trees regularly recurring glimpses of four or five swings in motion
These were nearest him and clearest to the vision as well at the instant when they reached their highest forward point
The seats were filled with girls some of them quite grown young women and their curving upward sweep through the air was disclosing at its climax a remarkable profusion of white skirts and black stockings
The sight struck him as indecorous in the extreme and he turned his eyes away
They met Celias and there was something latent in their brown depths which prompted him after a brief dalliance of interchanging glances to look again at the swings
That old maid Curran is really too ridiculous with those white stockings of hers remarked Celia some friend ought to tell her to dye them
Or pad them suggested Father Forbes with a gay little chuckle
I daresay the question of swings and ladies stockings hardly arises with you over at the campmeeting Mr
Ware
Theron laughed aloud at the conceit
I should say not
he replied
Im just dying to see a campmeeting
said Celia
You hear such racy accounts of what goes on at them
Dont go I beg of you
urged Theron with doleful emphasis
Dont lets even talk about them
I should like to feel this afternoon as if there was no such thing within a thousand miles of me as a campmeeting
Do you know all this interests me enormously
It is a revelation to me to see these thousands of good decent ordinary people just frankly enjoying themselves like human beings
I suppose that in this whole huge crowd there isnt a single person who will mention the subject of his soul to any other person all day long
I should think the assumption was a safe one said the priest smilingly unless he added on afterthought it be by way of a genial profanity
There used to be some old Clare men who said Hell to my soul
when they missed at quoits but I havent heard it for a long time
I daresay theyre all dead
I shall never forget that deathbedwhere I saw you first remarked Theron musingly
I date from that experience a whole new life
I have been greatly struck lately in reading our Northern Christian Advocate to see in the obituary notices of prominent Methodists how over and over again it is recorded that they got religion in their youth through being frightened by some illness of their own or some epidemic about them
The cholera year of 1832 seems to have made Methodists hand over fist
Even to this day our most successful revivalists those who work conversions wholesale wherever they go do it more by frightful pictures of hellfire surrounding the sinners deathbed than anything else
You could hear the same thing at our campmeeting tonight if you were there
There isnt so much difference as you think said Father Forbes dispassionately
Your people keep examining their souls just as children keep pulling up the bulbs they have planted to see are there any roots yet
Our people are more satisfied to leave their souls alone once they have been planted so to speak by baptism
But fear of hell governs them both pretty much alike
As I remember saying to you once before there is really nothing new under the sun
Even the saying isnt new
Though there seem to have been the most tremendous changes in races and civilizations and religions stretching over many thousands of years yet nothing is in fact altered very much
Where religions are concerned the human race are still very like savages in a dangerous wood in the dark telling one another ghost stories around a campfire
They have always been like that
What nonsense
cried Celia
I have no patience with such gloomy rubbish
The Greeks had a religion full of beauty and happiness and lightheartedness and they werent frightened of death at all
They made the image of death a beautiful boy with a torch turned down
Their greatest philosophers openly preached and practised the doctrine of suicide when one was tired of life
Our own early Church was full of these broad and beautiful Greek ideas
You know that yourself
And it was only when your miserable Jeromes and Augustines and Cyrils brought in the abominable meannesses and cruelties of the Jewish Old Testament and stamped out the sane and lovely Greek elements in the Church that Christians became the poor whining cowardly egotists they are troubling about their little tinpot souls and scaring themselves in their churches by skulls and crossbones
My dear Celia interposed the priest patting her shoulder gently we will have no Greek debate today
Mr Ware has been permitted to taboo campmeetings and I claim the privilege to cry off on Greeks
Look at those fellows down there trampling over one another to get more beer
What have they to do with Athens or Athens with them
I take it Mr Ware he went on with a grave face but a twinkling eye that what we are observing here in front of us is symbolical of a great ethical and theological revolution which in time will modify and control the destiny of the entire American people
You see those young Irishmen there struggling like pigs at a trough to get their fill of German beer
That signifies a conquest of Teuton over Kelt more important and farreaching in its results than the landing of Hengist and Horsa
The Kelt has come to grief heretoforeor at least been forced to play second fiddle to other racesbecause he lacked the right sort of a drink
He has in his blood an excess of impulsive imaginative even fantastic qualities
It is much easier for him to make a fool of himself to begin with than it is for people of slower wits and more sluggish temperaments
When you add whiskey to that or that essence of melancholia which in Ireland they call porther you get the Kelt at his very weakest and worst
These young men down there are changing all that
They have discovered lager
Already many of them can outdrink the Germans at their own beverage
The lagerdrinking Irishman in a few generations will be a new type of humanitythe Kelt at his best
He will dominate America
He will be THE American
And his churchwith the Italian element thrown clean out of it and its Pope living say in Baltimore or Georgetown will be the Church of America
Let us have some more lager at once put in Celia
This revolution cant be hurried forward too rapidly
Theron could not feel sure how much of the priests discourse was in jest how much in earnest
It seems to me he said that as things are going it doesnt look much as if the America of the future will trouble itself about any kind of a church
The march of science must very soon produce a universal scepticism
It is in the nature of human progress
What all intelligent men recognize today the masses must surely come to see in time
Father Forbes laughed outright this time
My dear Mr Ware he said as they touched glasses again and sipped the fresh beer that had been brought them of all our fictions there is none so utterly baseless and empty as this idea that humanity progresses
The savages natural impression is that the world he sees about him was made for him and that the rest of the universe is subordinated to him and his world and that all the spirits and demons and gods occupy themselves exclusively with him and his affairs
That idea was the basis of every pagan religion and it is the basis of the Christian religion simply because it is the foundation of human nature
That foundation is just as firm and unshaken today as it was in the Stone Age
It will always remain and upon it will always be built some kind of a religious superstructure
Intelligent men as you call them really have very little influence even when they all pull one way
The people as a whole soon get tired of them
They give too much trouble
The most powerful forces in human nature are selfprotection and inertia
The middleaged man has found out that the chief wisdom in life is to bend to the pressures about him to shut up and do as others do
Even when he thinks he has rid his own mind of superstitions he sees that he will best enjoy a peaceful life by leaving other peoples superstitions alone
That is always the ultimate view of the crowd
But I dont see observed Theron granting that all this is true how you think the Catholic Church will come out on top
I could understand it of Unitarianism or Universalism or the Episcopal Church where nobody seems to have to believe particularly in anything except the beauty of its burial service but I should think the very rigidity of the Catholic creed would make it impossible
There everything is hard and fast nothing is elastic there is no room for compromise
The Church is always compromising explained the priest only it does it so slowly that no one man lives long enough to quite catch it at the trick
No the great secret of the Catholic Church is that it doesnt debate with sceptics
No matter what points you make against it it is never betrayed into answering back
It simply says these things are sacred mysteries which you are quite free to accept and be saved or reject and be damned
There is something intelligible and fine about an attitude like that
When people have grown tired of their absurd and fruitless wrangling over texts and creeds which humanly speaking are all barbaric nonsense they will come back to repose pleasantly under the Catholic roof in that restful house where things are taken for granted
There the manners are charming the service excellent the decoration and upholstery most acceptable to the eye and the musiche made a little mock bow here to Celiathe music at least is divine
There you have nothing to do but be agreeable and avoid scandal and observe the convenances
You are no more expected to express doubts about the Immaculate Conception than you are to ask the lady whom you take down to dinner how old she is
Now that is as I have said an intelligent and rational church for people to have
As the Irish civilize themselvesyou observe them diligently engaged in the process down below there and the social roughness of their church becomes softened and ameliorated Americans will inevitably be attracted toward it
In the end it will embrace them all and be modified by them and in turn influence their development till you will have a new nation and a new national church each representative of the other
And all this is to be done by lager beer
Theron ventured to comment jokingly
He was conscious of a novel perspiration around the bridge of his nose which was obviously another effect of the drink
The priest passed the pleasantry by
No he said seriously what you must see is that there must always be a church
If one did not exist it would be necessary to invent it
It is needed first and foremost as a police force
It is needed secondly so to speak as a fire insurance
It provides the most even temperature and pure atmosphere for the growth of young children
It furnishes the best obtainable social machinery for marrying off ones daughters getting to know the right people patching up quarrels and so on
The priesthood earn their salaries as the agents for these valuable social arrangements
Their theology is thrown in as a sort of intellectual diversion like the ritual of a benevolent organization
There are some who get excited about this part of it just as one hears of FreeMasons who believe that the sun rises and sets to exemplify their ceremonies
Others take their duties more quietly and understanding just what it all amounts to make the best of it like you and me
Theron assented to the philosophy and the compliment by a grave bow
Yes that is the ideato make the best of it he said and fastened his regard boldly this time upon the swings
We were both ordained by our bishops continued the priest at an age when those worthy old gentlemen would not have trusted our combined wisdom to buy a horse for them
And I was married broke in Theron with an eagerness almost vehement when I had only just been ordained
At the worst YOU had only the Church fastened upon your back before you were old enough to know what you wanted
It is easy enough to make the best of THAT but it is different with me
A marked silence followed this outburst
The Rev
Mr Ware had never spoken of his marriage to either of these friends before and something in their manner seemed to suggest that they did not find the subject inviting now that it had been broached
He himself was filled with a desire to say more about it
He had never clearly realized before what a genuine grievance it was
The moisture at the top of his nose merged itself into tears in the corners of his eyes as the cruel enormity of the sacrifice he had made in his youth rose before him
His whole life had been fettered and darkened by it
He turned his gaze from the swings toward Celia to claim the sympathy he knew she would feel for him
But Celia was otherwise engaged
A young man had come up to hera tall and extremely thin young man soberly dressed and with a long gaunt holloweyed face the skin of which seemed at once florid and pale
He had sandy hair and the rough hands of a workman but he was speaking to Miss Madden in the confidential tones of an equal
I can do nothing at all with him this newcomer said to her
Hell not be said by me
Perhaps hed listen to you
Its likely Ill go down there
said Celia
He may do what he likes for all me
Take my advice Michael and just go your way and leave him to himself
There was a time when I would have taken out my eyes for him but it was love wasted and thrown away
After the warnings hes had if he WILL bring trouble on himself lets make it no affair of ours
Theron had found himself exchanging glances of inquiry with this young man
Mr Ware said Celia here let me introduce you to my brother Michaelmy full brother
Mr Ware remembered him now and began in response to the others formal bow to say something about their having met in the dark inside the church
But Celia held up her hand
Im afraid Mr Ware she said hurriedly that you are in for a glimpse of the family skeleton
I will apologize for the infliction in advance
Wonderingly Theron followed her look and saw another young man who had come up the path from the crowd below and was close upon them
The minister recognized in him a figure which had seemed to be the centre of almost every group about the bar that he had studied in detail
He was a small dapper elegantly attired youth with dark hair and the handsome regularly carved face of an actor
He advanced with a smiling countenance and unsteady step his silk hat thrust back upon his head his frockcoat and vest unbuttoned and his neckwear disarrangedand saluted the company with amiability
I saw you up here Father Forbes he said with a thickened and erratic utterance
Whynt you come down and join us
Im setting em up for everybody
You got to take care of the boys you know
Ill blow in the last cent Ive got in the world for the boys every time and they know it
Theyre solider for me than they ever were for anybody
Thats how it is
If you stand by the boys the boysll stand by you
Im going to the Assembly for this district and they aint nobody can stop me
The boys are just red hot for me
Wish youd come down Father Forbes and address a few words to the meetingjust mention that Im a candidate and say Im bound to win hands down
Thatll make you solid with the boys and well be all good fellows together
Come on down
The priest affably disengaged his arm from the clutch which the speaker had laid upon it and shook his head in gentle deprecation
No no you must excuse me Theodore he said
We mustnt meddle in politics you know
Politics be damned
urged Theodore grabbing the priests other arm and tugging at it stoutly to pull him down the path
I say boys he shouted to those below heres Father Forbes and hes going to come down and address the meeting
Come on Father
Come down and have a drink with the boys
It was Celia who sharply pulled his hand away from the priests arm this time
Go away with you
she snapped in low angry tones at the intruder
You should be ashamed of yourself
If you cant keep sober yourself you can at least keep your hands off the priest
I should think youd have more decency when youre in such a state as this than to come where I am
If youve no respect for yourself you might have that much respect for me
And before strangers too
Oh I mustnt come where YOU are eh
remarked the peccant Theodore straightening himself with an elaborate effort
Youve bought these woods have you
Ive got a hundred friends here all the same for every one youll ever have in your life Redhead and dont you forget it
Go and spend your money with them then and dont come insulting decent people said Celia
Before strangers too
the young man called out with beery sarcasm
Oh well take care of the strangers all right
He had not seemed to be aware of Therons presence much less his identity before but he turned to him now with a knowing grin
Im running for the Assembly Mr Ware he said speaking loudly and with deliberate effort to avoid the drunken elisions and comminglings to which his speech tended and I want you to fix up the Methodists solid for me
Im going to drive over to the campmeeting tonight me and some of the boys in a barouche and Ill put a twentydollar bill on their plate
Here it is now if you want to see it
As the young man began fumbling in a vestpocket Theron gathered his wits together
Youd better not go this evening he said as convincingly as he knew how because the gates will be closed very early and the Saturdayevening services are of a particularly special nature quite reserved for those living on the grounds
Rats
said Theodore raising his head and abandoning the search for the bill
Why dont you speak out like a man and say you think Im too drunk
I dont think that is a question which need arise between us Mr Madden murmured Theron confusedly
Oh dont you make any mistake
A hell of a lot of questions arise between us Mr Ware cried Theodore with a sudden accession of vigor in tone and mien
And one of em isgo away from me Michaelone of em is I say why dont you leave our girls alone
Theyve got their own priests to make fools of themselves over without any sneak of a Protestant parson coming meddling round them
Youre a married man into the bargain and youve got in your house this minute a piano that my sister bought and paid for
Oh Ive seen the entry in Thurstons books
You have the cheek to talk to me about being drunkwhy These remarks were never concluded for Father Forbes here clapped a hand abruptly over the offending mouth and flung his free arm in a tight grip around the young mans waist
Come with me Michael
he said and the two men led the reluctant and resisting Theodore at a sharp pace off into the woods
Theron and Celia stood and watched them disappear among the undergrowth
Its the dirty Foley blood thats in him he heard her say as if between clenched teeth
The girls big brown eyes when Theron looked into them again were still fixed upon the screen of foliage and dilated like those of a Medusa mask
The blood had gone away and left the fair face and neck as white it seemed to him as marble
Even her lips fiercely bitten together appeared colorless
The picture of consuming and powerless rage which she presented and the shuddering tremor which ran over her form as visible as the quivering track of a gust of wind across a pond awed and frightened him
Tenderness toward her helpless state came too and uppermost
He drew her arm into his and turned their backs upon the picnic scene
Let us walk a little up the path into the woods he said and get away from all this
The further away the better she answered bitterly and he felt the shiver run through her again as she spoke
The methodical waltzmusic from that unseen dancing platform rose again above all other sounds
They moved up the woodland path their steps insensibly falling into the rhythm of its strains and vanished from sight among the trees
CHAPTER XXIV Theron and Celia walked in silence for some minutes until the noises of the throng they had left behind were lost
The path they followed had grown indefinite among the grass and creepers of the forest carpet now it seemed to end altogether in a little copse of young birches the delicately graceful stems of which were clustered about a parent stump long since decayed and overgrown with lichens and layers of thick moss
As the two paused the girl suddenly sank upon her knees then threw herself face forward upon the soft green bark which had formed itself above the roots of the ancient mothertree
Her companion looked down in pained amazement at what he saw
Her body shook with the violence of recurring sobs or rather gasps of wrath and grief Her hands with stiffened clawlike fingers dug into the moss and tangle of tiny vines and tore them by the roots
The halfstifled sounds of weeping that arose from where her face grovelled in the leaves were terrible to his ears
He knew not what to say or do but gazed in resourceless suspense at the strange figure she made
It seemed a cruelly long time that she lay there almost at his feet struggling fiercely with the fury that was in her
All at once the paroxysms passed away the sounds of wild weeping ceased
Celia sat up and with her handkerchief wiped the tears and leafy fragments from her face
She rearranged her hat and the braids of her hair with swift instinctive touches brushed the woodland debris from her front and sprang to her feet
Im all right now she said briskly
There was palpable effort in her light tone and in the stormy sort of smile which she forced upon her blotched and perturbed countenance but they were only too welcome to Therons anxious mood
Thank God
he blurted out all radiant with relief
I feared you were going to have a fitor something
Celia laughed a little artificially at first then with a genuine surrender to the comic side of his visible fright
The mirth came back into the brown depths of her eyes again and her face cleared itself of tearstains and the marks of agitation
I AM a nice quiet party for a Methodist minister to go walking in the woods with am I not
she cried shaking her skirts and smiling at him
I am not a Methodist ministerplease
answered Theronat least not todayand herewith you
I am just a man nothing morea man who has escaped from lifelong imprisonment and feels for the first time what it is to be free
Ah my friend Celia said shaking her head slowly Im afraid you deceive yourself
You are not by any means free
You are only looking out of the window of your prison as you call it
The doors are locked just the same
I will smash them
he declared with confidence
Or for that matter I HAVE smashed thembattered them to pieces
You dont realize what progress I have made what changes there have been in me since that night you remember that wonderful night
I am quite another being I assure you
And really it dates from way beyond that why from the very first evening when I came to you in the church
The window in Father Forbes room was open and I stood by it listening to the music next door and I could just faintly see on the dark window across the alleyway a stainedglass picture of a woman
I suppose it was the Virgin Mary
She had hair like yours and your face too and that is why I went into the church and found you
Yes that is why
Celia regarded him with gravity
You will get yourself into great trouble my friend she said
Thats where youre wrong put in Theron
Not that Id mind any trouble in this wide world so long as you called me my friend but Im not going to get into any at all
I know a trick worth two of that
Ive learned to be a showman
I can preach now far better than I used to and I can get through my work in half the time and keep on the right side of my people and get along with perfect smoothness
I was too green before
I took the thing seriously and I let every meanfisted curmudgeon and crazy fanatic worry me and keep me on pins and needles
I dont do that any more
Ive taken a new measure of life
I see now what life is really worth and Im going to have my share of it
Why should I deliberately deny myself all possible happiness for the rest of my days simply because I made a fool of myself when I was in my teens
Other men are not eternally punished like that for what they did as boys and I wont submit to it either
I will be as free to enjoy myself asas Father Forbes
Celia smiled softly and shook her head again
Poor man to call HIM free
she said why he is bound hand and foot
You dont in the least realize how he is hedged about the work he has to do the thousand suspicious eyes that watch his every movement eager to bring the Bishop down upon him
And then think of his sacrifice the great sacrifice of allto never know what love means to forswear his manhood to live a forlorn celibate life you have no idea how sadly that appeals to a woman
Let us sit down here for a little said Theron we seem at the end of the path
She seated herself on the rootbased mound and he reclined at her side with an arm carelessly extended behind her on the moss
I can see what you mean he went on after a pause
But to me do you know there is an enormous fascination in celibacy
You forget that I know the reverse of the medal
I know how the mind can be cramped the nerves harassed the ambitions spoiled and rotted the whole existence darkened and belittled byby the other thing
I have never talked to you before about my marriage
I dont think wed better talk about it now observed Celia
There must be many more amusing topics
He missed the spirit of her remark
You are right he said slowly
It is too sad a thing to talk about
But there
it is my load and I bear it and theres nothing more to be said
Theron drew a heavy sigh and let his fingers toy abstractedly with a ribbon on the outer edge of Celias penumbra of apparel
No she said
We mustnt snivel and we mustnt sulk
When I get into a rage it makes me ill and I storm my way through it and tear things but it doesnt last long and I come out of it feeling all the better
I dont know that Ive ever seen your wife
I suppose she hasnt got red hair
I think its a kind of light brown answered Theron with an effect of exerting his memory
It seems that you only take notice of hair in stainedglass windows was Celias comment
Ohh
he murmured reproachfully as ifas if but I wont say what I was going to
Thats not fair
she said
The little touch of whimsical mockery which she gave to the serious declaration was delicious to him
You have me at such a disadvantage
Here am I rattling out whatever comes into my head exposing all my lightest emotions and laying bare my very heart in candor and you meditate you turn things over cautiously in your mind like a second Machiavelli
I grow afraid of you you are so subtle and mysterious in your reserves
Theron gave a tug at the ribbon to show the joy he had in her delicate chaff
No it is you who are secretive he said
You never told me aboutabout the piano
The word was out
A minute before it had seemed incredible to him that he should ever have the courage to utter it but here it was
He laid firm hold upon the ribbon which it appeared hung from her waist and drew himself a trifle nearer to her
I could never have consented to take it Im afraid he went on in a low voice if I had known
And even as it is I fear it wont be possible
What are you afraid of
asked Celia
Why shouldnt you take it
People in your profession never do get anything unless its given to them do they
Ive always understood it was like that
Ive often read of donation parties thats what theyre called isnt itwhere everybody is supposed to bring some gift to the minister
Very well then Ive simply had a donation party of my own thats all
Unless you mean that my being a Catholic makes a difference
I had supposed you were quite free from that kind of prejudice
So I am
Believe me I am
urged Theron
When Im with you it seems impossible to realize that there are people so narrow and contracted in their natures as to take account of such things
It is another atmosphere that I breathe near you
How could you imagine that such a thought about our difference of creedwould enter my head
In fact he concluded with a nervous halflaugh there isnt any such difference
Whatever your religion is its mine too
You rememberyou adopted me as a Greek
Did I
she rejoined
Well if thats the case it leaves you without a leg to stand on
I challenge you to find any instance where a Greek made any difficulties about accepting a piano from a friend
But seriously while we are talking about ityou introduced the subject I didntI might as well explain to you that I had no such intention when I picked the instrument out
It was later when I was talking to Thurstons people about the price that the whim seized me
Now it is the one fixed rule of my life to obey my whims
Whatever occurs to me as a possibly pleasant thing to do straight like a hash I go and do it
It is the only way that a person with means with plenty of money can preserve any freshness of character
If they stop to think what it would be prudent to do they get crusted over immediately
That is the curse of rich people they teach themselves to distrust and restrain every impulse toward unusual actions
They get to feel that it is more necessary for them to be cautious and conventional than it is for others
I would rather work at a washtub than occupy that attitude toward my bank account
I fight against any sign of it that I detect rising in my mind
The instant a wish occurs to me I rush to gratify it
That is my theory of life
That accounts for the piano and I dont see that youve anything to say about it at all
It seemed very convincing this theory of life
Somehow the thought of Miss Maddens riches had never before assumed prominence in Therons mind
Of course her father was very wealthy but it had not occurred to him that the daughters emancipation might run to the length of a personal fortune
He knew so little of rich people and their ways
He lifted his head and looked up at Celia with an awakened humility and awe in his glance
The glamour of a separate bankingaccount shone upon her
Where the soft woodland light played in among the strands of her disordered hair he saw the veritable gleam of gold
A mysterious new suggestion of power blended itself with the beauty of her face was exhaled in the faint perfume of her garments
He maintained a timorous hold upon the ribbon wondering at his hardihood in touching it or being near her at all
What surprises me he heard himself saying is that you are contented to stay in Octavius
I should think that you would travelgo abroadsee the beautiful things of the world surround yourself with the luxuries of big citiesand that sort of thing
Celia regarded the forest prospect straight in front of her with a pensive gaze
Sometimeno doubt I will sometime she said abstractedly
One reads so much nowadays he went on of American heiresses going to Europe and marrying dukes and noblemen
I suppose you will do that too
Princes would fight one another for you
The least touch of a smile softened for an instant the impassivity of her countenance
Then she stared harder than ever at the vague leafy distance
That is the oldfashioned idea she said in a musing tone that women must belong to somebody as if they were curios or statues or racehorses
You dont understand my friend that I have a different view
I am myself and I belong to myself exactly as much as any man
The notion that any other human being could conceivably obtain the slightest property rights in me is as preposterous as ridiculous aswhat shall I sayas the notion of your being taken out with a chain on your neck and sold by auction as a slave down on the canal bridge
I should be ashamed to be alive for another day if any other thought were possible to me
That is not the generally accepted view I should think faltered Theron
No more is it the accepted view that young married Methodist ministers should sit out alone in the woods with redheaded Irish girls
No my friend let us find what the generally accepted views are and as fast as we find them set our heels on them
There is no other way to live like real human beings
What on earth is it to me that other women crawl about on allfours and fawn like dogs on any hand that will buckle a collar onto them and toss them the leavings of the table
I am not related to them
I have nothing to do with them
They cannot make any rules for me
If pride and dignity and independence are dead in them why so much the worse for them
It is no affair of mine
Certainly it is no reason why I should get down and grovel also
No I at least stand erect on my legs
Mr Ware sat up and stared confusedly with round eyes and parted lips at his companion
Instinctively his brain dragged forth to the surface those epithets which the doctor had hurled in bitter contempt at hermad ass a mere bundle of egotism ignorance and redheaded lewdness
The words rose in their order on his memory hard and sharpedged like arrowheads
But to sit there quite at her side to breathe the same air and behold the calm loveliness of her profile to touch the ribbon of her dress and all the while to hold these poisoned darts of abuse levelled in thought at her breastit was monstrous
He could have killed the doctor at that moment
With an effort he drove the foul things from his mind scattered them back into the darkness
He felt that he had grown pale and wondered if she had heard the groan that seemed to have been forced from him in the struggle
Or was the groan imaginary
Celia continued to sit unmoved composedly looking upon vacancy
Therons eyes searched her face in vain for any sign of consciousness that she had astounded and bewildered him
She did not seem to be thinking of him at all
The proud calm of her thoughtful countenance suggested instead occupation with lofty and remote abstractions and noble ideals
Contemplating her he suddenly perceived that what she had been saying was great wonderful magnificent
An involuntary thrill ran through his veins at recollection of her words
His fancy likened it to the sensation he used to feel as a youth when the Fourth of July reader bawled forth that opening clause When in the course of human events it becomes necessary etc
It was nothing less than another Declaration of Independence he had been listening to
He sank again recumbent at her side and stretched the arm behind her nearer than before
Apparently then you will never marry
His voice trembled a little
Most certainly not
said Celia
You spoke so feelingly a little while ago he ventured along with hesitation about how sadly the notion of a priests sacrificing himselfnever knowing what love meant appealed to a woman
I should think that the idea of sacrificing herself would seem to her even sadder still
I dont remember that we mentioned THAT she replied
How do you meansacrificing herself
Theron gathered some of the outlying folds of her dress in his hand and boldly patted and caressed them
You so beautiful and so free with such fine talents and abilities he murmured you who could have the whole world at your feetare you too never going to know what love means
Do you call that no sacrifice
To me it is the most terrible that my imagination can conceive
Celia laugheda gentle amused little laugh in which Therons ears traced elements of tenderness
You must regulate that imagination of yours she said playfully
It conceives the thing that is not
Pray whenand here turning her head she bent down upon his face a gaze of arch mockseriousnesspray when did I describe myself in these terms
When did I say that I should never know what love meant
For answer Theron laid his head down upon his arm and closed his eyes and held his face against the draperies encircling her
I cannot think
he groaned
The thing that came uppermost in his mind as it swayed and rocked in the tempest of emotion was the strange reminiscence of early childhood in it all
It was like being a little boy again nestling in an innocent unthinking transport of affection against his mothers skirts
The tears he felt scalding his eyes were the spontaneous unashamed tears of a child the tremulous and exquisite joy which spread wavelike over him at once reposeful and yearning was full of infantile purity and sweetness
He had not comprehended at all before what wellsprings of spiritual beauty what limpid depths of idealism his nature contained
We were speaking of our respective religions he heard Celia say as imperturbably as if there had been no digression worth mentioning
Yes he assented and moved his head so that he looked up at her back hair and the leaves high above mottled against the sky
The wish to lie there where now he could just catch the roseleaf line of her underchin as well was very strong upon him
Yes
he repeated
I cannot talk to you like that she said and he sat up again shamefacedly
YesI think we were speaking of religionssome time ago he faltered to relieve the situation
The dreadful thought that she might be annoyed began to oppress him
Well you said whatever my religion was it was yours too
That entitles you at least to be told what the religion is
Now I am a Catholic
Theron much mystified nodded his head
Could it be possiblewas there coming a deliberate suggestion that he should become a convert
YesI know he murmured
But I should explain that I am only a Catholic in the sense that its symbolism is pleasant to me
You remember what Schopenhauer saidyou cannot have the water by itself you must also have the jug that it is in
Very well the Catholic religion is my jug
I put into it the things I like
They were all there long ago thousands of years ago
The Jews threw them out we will put them back again
We will restore art and poetry and the love of beauty and the gentle spiritual soulful life
The Greeks had it and Christianity would have had it too if it hadnt been for those brutes they call the Fathers
They loved ugliness and dirt and the thought of hellfire
They hated women
In all the earlier stages of the Church women were very prominent in it
Jesus himself appreciated women and delighted to have them about him and talk with them and listen to them
That was the very essence of the Greek spirit and it breathed into Christianity at its birth a sweetness and a grace which twenty generations of cranks and savages like Paul and Jerome and Tertullian werent able to extinguish
But the very man Cyril who killed Hypatia and thus began the dark ages unwittingly did another thing which makes one almost forgive him
To please the Egyptians he secured the Churchs acceptance of the adoration of the Virgin
It is that idea which has kept the Greek spirit alive and grown and grown till at last it will rule the world
It was only epileptic Jews who could imagine a religion without sex in it
I remember the pictures of the Virgin in your room said Theron feeling more himself again
I wondered if they quite went with the statues
The remark won a smile from Celias lips
They get along together better than you suppose she answered
Besides they are not all pictures of Mary
One of them standing on the moon is of Isis with the infant Horus in her arms
Another might as well be Mahamie bearing the miraculously born Buddha or Olympias with her child Alexander or even Perictione holding her babe Platoall these were similar cases you know
Almost every religion had its Immaculate Conception
What does it all come to except to show us that man turns naturally toward the worship of the maternal idea
That is the deepest of all our instinctslove of woman who is at once daughter and wife and mother
It is that that makes the world go round
Brave thoughts shaped themselves in Therons mind and shone forth in a confident yet wistful smile on his face
lt is a pity you cannot change estates with me for one minute he said in steady low tone
Then you would realize the tremendous truth of what you have been saying
It is only your intellect that has reached out and grasped the idea
If you were in my place you would discover that your heart was bursting with it as well
Celia turned and looked at him
I myself he went on would not have known half an hour ago what you meant by the worship of the maternal idea
I am much older than you
I am a strong mature man
But when I lay down there and shut my eyesbecause the charm and marvel of this whole experience had for the moment overcome methe strangest sensation seized upon me
It was absolutely as if I were a boy again a good pureminded fond little child and you were the mother that I idolized
Celia had not taken her eyes from his face
I find myself liking you better at this moment she said with gravity than I have ever liked you before
Then as by a sudden impulse she sprang to her feet
Come
she cried her voice and manner all vivacity once more we have been here long enough
Upon the instant as Theron was more laboriously getting up it became apparent to them both that perhaps they had been there too long
A boy with a gun under his arm and two gray squirrels tied by the tails slung across his shoulder stood at the entrance to the glade some dozen paces away regarding them with undisguised interest
Upon the discovery that he was in turn observed he resumed his interrupted progress through the woods whistling softly as he went and vanished among the trees
Heavens above
groaned Theron shudderingly
Know him
he went on in answer to the glance of inquiry on his companions face
I should think I did
He spades my my wifes garden for her
He used to bring our milk
He works in the law office of one of my trustees the one who isnt friendly to me but is very friendly indeed with mywith Mrs Ware
Oh what shall I do
It may easily mean my ruin
Celia looked at him attentively
The color had gone out of his face and with it the effect of earnestness and mental elevation which a minute before had caught her fancy
Somehow I fear that I do not like you quite so much just now my friend she remarked
In Gods name dont say that
urged Theron
He raised his voice in agitated entreaty
You dont know what these people arehow they would leap at the barest hint of a scandal about me
In my position I am a thousand times more defenceless than any woman
Just a single whisper and I am done for
Let me point out to you Mr Ware said Celia slowly that to be seen sitting and talking with me whatever doubts it may raise as to a gentlemans intellectual condition need not necessarily blast his social reputation beyond all hope whatever
Theron stared at her as if he had not grasped her meaning
Then he winced visibly under it and put out his hands to implore her
Forgive me
Forgive me
he pleaded
I was beside myself for the moment with the fright of the thing
Oh say you do forgive me Celia
He made haste to support this daring use of her name
I have been so happy todayso deeply so vastly happy like the little child I spoke ofand that is so new in my lonely lifethatthe suddenness of the thingit just for the instant unstrung me
Dont be too hard on me for it
And I had hoped tooI had had such genuine heartfelt pleasure in the thoughtthat an hour or two ago when you were unhappy perhaps it had been some sort of consolation to you that I was with you
Celia was looking away
When he took her hand she did not withdraw it but turned and nodded in musing general assent to what he had said
Yes we have both been unstrung as you call it today she said decidedly out of pitch
Let each forgive the other and say no more about it
She took his arm and they retraced their steps along the path again in silence
The labored noise of the orchestra as it were returned to meet them
They halted at an intersecting footpath
I go back to my slaverymy double bondage said Theron letting his voice sink to a sigh
But even if I am put on the rack for it I shall have had one day of glory
I think you may kiss me in memory of that one day or of a few minutes in that day said Celia
Their lips brushed each other in a swift almost perfunctory caress
Theron went his way at a hurried pace the sobered tones of her goodbye beating upon his brain with every measure of the droning waltzmusic
PART IV CHAPTER XXV The memory of the kiss abode with Theron
Like Aarons rod it swallowed up one by one all competing thoughts and recollections and made his brain its slave
Even as he strode back through the woods to the campmeeting it was the kiss that kept his feet in motion and guided their automatic course
All along the watches of the restless night it was the kiss that bore him sweet company and wandered with him from one broken dream of bliss to another
Next day it was the kiss that made of life for him a sort of sunlit wonderland
He preached his sermon in the morning and took his appointed part in the other services of afternoon and evening apparently to everybodys satisfaction to him it was all a vision
When the beautiful full moon rose this Sunday evening and glorified the clearing and the forest with its mellow harvest radiance he could have groaned with the burden of his joy
He went out alone into the light and bared his head to it and stood motionless for a long time
In all his life he had never been impelled as powerfully toward earnest and soulful thanksgiving
The impulse to kneel there in the pure tender moonlight and lift up offerings of praise to God kept uppermost in his mind
Some formless resignation restrained him from the act itself but the spirit of it hallowed his mood
He gazed up at the broad luminous face of the satellite
You are our God he murmured
Hers and mine
You are the most beautiful of heavenly creatures as she is of the angels on earth
I am speechless with reverence for you both
It was not until the campmeeting broke up four days later and Theron with the rest returned to town that the material aspects of what had happened and might be expected to happen forced themselves upon his mind
The kiss was a child of the forest
So long as Theron remained in the camp the image of the kiss which was enshrined in his heart and ministered to by all his thoughts continued enveloped in a haze of sylvan mystery like a dryad
Suggestions of its beauty and holiness came to him in the odors of the woodland at the sight of wild flowers and waterlilies
When he walked alone in unfamiliar parts of the forest he carried about with him the halfconscious idea of somewhere coming upon a strange hidden pool which mortal eye had not seen beforea deep sequestered mere of springfed waters walled in by rich tangled growths of verdure and bearing upon its virgin bosom only the shadows of the primeval wilderness and the light of the eternal skies
His fancy dwelt upon some such nook as the enchanted home of the fairy that possessed his soul
The place though he never found it became real to him
As he pictured it there rose sometimes from among the lilypads stirring the translucent depths and fluttering over the waters surface drops like gems the wonderful form of a woman with pale leaves wreathed in her luxuriant red hair and a skin which gave forth light
With the homecoming to Octavius his dreams began to take more account of realities
In a day or two he was wide awake and thinking hard
The kiss was as much as ever the ceaseless companion of his hours but it no longer insisted upon shrouding itself in vines and woodland creepers or outlining itself in phosphorescent vagueness against mystic backgrounds of nymphhaunted glades
It advanced out into the noonday and assumed tangible dimensions and substance
He saw that it was related to the facts of his daily life and had in turn altered his own relations to all these facts
What ought he to do
What COULD he do
Apparently nothing but wait
He waited for a weekthen for another week
The conclusion that the initiative had been left to him began to take shape in his mind
From this it seemed but a step to the passionate resolve to act at once
Turning the situation over and over in his anxious thoughts two things stood out in special prominence
One was that Celia loved him
The other was that the boy in Gorringes law office and possibly Gorringe and heaven only knew how many others besides had reasons for suspecting this to be true
And what about Celia
Side by side with the moving rapture of thinking about her as a woman there rose the substantial satisfaction of contemplating her as Miss Madden
She had kissed him and she was very rich
The things gradually linked themselves before his eyes
He tried a thousand varying guesses at what she proposed to do and each time reined up his imagination by the reminder that she was confessedly a creature of whims who proposed to do nothing but was capable of all things
And as to the boy
If he had blabbed what he saw it was incredible that somebody should not take the subject up and impart a scandalous twist to it and send it rolling like a snowball to gather up exaggeration and foul innuendo till it was big enough to overwhelm him
What would happen to him if a formal charge were preferred against him
He looked it up in the Discipline
Of course if his accusers magnified their mean suspicions and calumnious imaginings to the point of formulating a charge it would be one of immorality
They could prove nothing there was nothing to prove
At the worst it was an indiscretion which would involve his being admonished by his Presiding Elder
Or if these narrow bigots confused slanders with proofs and showed that they intended to convict him then it would be open to him to withdraw from the ministry in advance of his condemnation
His relation to the church would be the same as if he had been expelled but to the outer world it would be different
And supposing he did withdraw from the ministry
Yes this was the important point
What if he did abandon this mistaken profession of his
On its mental side the relief would be prodigious unthinkable
But on the practical side the breadandbutter side
For some days Theron paused with a shudder when he reached this question
The thought of the plunge into unknown material responsibilities gave him a sinking heart
He tried to imagine himself lecturing canvassing for books or insurance policies writing for newspapers and remained frightened
But suddenly one day it occurred to him that these qualms and forebodings were sheer folly
Was not Celia rich
Would she not with lightning swiftness draw forth that checkbook like the flashing sword of a champion from its scabbard and run to his relief
Why of course
It was absurd not to have thought of that before
He recalled her momentary anger with him that afternoon in the woods when he had cried out that discovery would mean ruin to him
He saw clearly enough now that she had been grieved at his want of faith in her protection
In his flurry of fright he had lost sight of the fact that if exposure and trouble came to him she would naturally feel that she had been the cause of his martyrdom
It was plain enough now
If he got into hot water it would be solely on account of his having been seen with her
He had walked into the woods with herthe further the better had been her own wordsout of pure kindliness and the desire to lead her away from the scene of her brothers and her own humiliation
But why amplify arguments
Her own warm heart would tell her on the instant how he had been sacrificed for her sake and would bring her eager and devoted to his succor
That was all right then
Slowly from this point suggestions expanded themselves
The future could be if he willed it one long serene triumph of love and lofty intellectual companionship and existence softened and enriched at every point by all that wealth could command and the most exquisite tastes suggest
Should he will it
Ah
the question answered itself
But he could not enter upon this beckoning heaven of a future until he had freed himself
When Celia said to him Come
he must not be in the position to reply I should like to but unfortunately I am tied by the leg
He should have to leave Octavius leave the ministry leave everything
He could not begin too soon to face these contingencies
Very likely Celia had not thought it out as far as this
With her it was a mere vague sometime I may
But the harder masculine sense Theron felt existed for the very purpose of correcting and giving point to these loose feminine notions of time and space
It was for him to clear away the obstacles and map the plans out with definite decision
One warm afternoon as he lolled in his easychair under the open window of his study musing upon the evershifting phases of this vast complicated urgent problem some chance words from the sidewalk in front came to his ears and coming remained to clarify his thoughts
Two ladies whose voices were strange to him had stopped as so many people almost daily stoppedto admire the garden of the parsonage
One of them expressed her pleasure in general terms
Said the other My husband declares those dahlias alone couldnt be matched for thirty dollars and that some of those gladiolus must have cost three or four dollars apiece
I know weve spent simply oceans of money on our garden and it doesnt begin to compare with this
It seems like a sinful waste to me said her companion
Noo the other hesitated
No I dont think quite that if you can afford it just as well as not
But it does seem to me that Id rather live in a little better house and not spend it ALL on flowers
Just LOOK at that cactus
The voices died away
Theron sat up with a look of arrested thought upon his face then sprang to his feet and moved hurriedly through the parlor to an open front window
Peering out with caution he saw that the two women receding from view were fashionably dressed and evidently came from homes of means
He stared after them in a blank way until they turned a corner
He went into the hall then put on his frockcoat and hat and stepped out into the garden
He was conscious of having rather avoided it heretoforenot altogether without reasons of his own lying unexamined somewhere in the recesses of his mind
Now he walked slowly about and examined the flowers with great attentiveness
The season was advancing and he saw that many plants had gone out of bloom
But what a magnificent plenitude of blossoms still remained
Thirty dollars worth of dahliasthat was what the stranger had said
Theron hardly brought himself to credit the statement but all the same it was apparent to even his uninformed eye that these huge imbricated flowering masses with their extraordinary halfcolors must be unusual
He remembered that the boy in Gorringes office had spoken of just one lot of plants costing thirtyone dollars and sixty cents and there had been two other lots as well
The figures remained surprisingly distinct in his memory
It was no good deceiving himself any longer of course these were the plants that Gorringe had spent his money upon here all about him
As he surveyed them with a sour regard a cool breeze stirred across the garden
The tall overladen flowerspikes of gladioli bent and nodded at him the hollyhocks and flaming alvias the clustered blossoms on the standard roses the delicately painted lilies on their stiltlike stems fluttered in the wind and seemed all bowing satirically to him
Yes Levi Gorringe paid for us
He almost heard their mocking declaration
Out in the backyard where a longer day of sunshine dwelt there were many other flowers and notably a bed of geraniums which literally made the eye ache
Standing at this rear corner of the house he caught the droning sound of Alices voice humming a hymn to herself as she went about her kitchen work
He saw her through the open window
She was sweeping and had a sort of cap on her head which did not add to the graces of her appearance
He looked at her with a hard glance recalling as a fresh grievance the ten days of intolerable boredom he had spent cooped up in a ridiculous little tent with her at the campmeeting
She must have realized at the time how odious the enforced companionship was to him
Yes beyond doubt she did
It came back to him now that they had spoken but rarely to each other
She had not even praised his sermon upon the Sabbathquestion which every one else had been in raptures over
For that matter she no longer praised anything he did and took obvious pains to preserve toward him a distant demeanor
So much the better he felt himself thinking
If she chose to behave in that offish and unwifely fashion she could blame no one but herself for its results
She had seen him and came now to the window wateringpot and broom in hand
She put her head out to breathe a breath of dustless air and began as if she would smile on him
Then her face chilled and stiffened as she caught his look
Shall you be home for supper
she asked in her iciest tone
He had not thought of going out before
The question and the manner of it gave immediate urgency to the idea of going somewhere
I may or I may not he replied
It is quite impossible for me to say
He turned on his heel with this and walked briskly out of the yard and down the street
It was the most natural thing that presently he should be strolling past the Madden house and letting a covert glance stray over its front and the grounds about it as he loitered along
Every day since his return from the woods he had given the fates this chance of bringing Celia to meet him without avail
He had hung about in the vicinity of the Catholic church on several evenings as well but to no purpose
The organ inside was dumb and he could detect no signs of Celias presence on the curtains of the pastorate next door
This day too there was no one visible at the home of the Maddens and he walked on a little sadly
It was weary work waiting for the signal that never came
But there were compensations
His mind reverted doggedly to the flowers in his garden and to Alices behavior toward him
They insisted upon connecting themselves in his thoughts
Why should Levi Gorringe a moneylender and therefore the last man in the world to incur reckless expenditure go and buy perhaps a hundred dollars worth of flowers for his wifes garden
It was timehigh timeto face this question
And his experiencing religion afterward just when Alice did and marching down to the rail to kneel beside herthat was a thing to be thought of too
Meditation it is true hardly threw fresh light upon the matter
It was incredible of course that there should be anything wrong
To even shape a thought of Alice in connection with gallantry would be wholly impossible
Nor could it be said that Gorringe in his new capacity as a professing churchmember had disclosed any sign of ulterior motives or of insincerity
Yet there the facts were
While Theron pondered them their mystery if they involved a mystery baffled him altogether
But when he had finished he found himself all the same convinced that neither Alice nor Gorringe would be free to blame him for anything he might do
He had grounds for complaint against them
If he did not himself know just what these grounds were it was certain enough that THEY knew
Very well then let them take the responsibility for what happened
It was indeed awkward that at the moment as Theron chanced to emerge temporarily from his brownstudy his eyes fell full upon the spare wellknit form of Levi Gorringe himself standing only a few feet away in the staircase entrance to his law office
His lean face browned by the summers exposure had a more Arabian aspect than ever
His hands were in his pockets and he held an unlighted cigar between his teeth
He looked the Rev
Mr Ware over calmly and nodded recognition
Theron had halted instinctively
On the instant he would have given a great deal not to have stopped at all
It was stupid of him to have paused but it would not do now to go on without words of some sort
He moved over to the doorway and made a halfhearted pretence of looking at the photographs in one of the showcases at its side
As Mr Gorringe did not take his hands from his pockets there was no occasion for any formal greeting
I had no idea that they took such good pictures in Octavius Theron remarked after a minutes silence still bending in examination of the photographs
They ought to they charge New York prices observed the lawyer sententiously
Theron found in the words confirmation of his feeling that Gorringe was not naturally a lavish or extravagant man
Rather was he a careful and calculating man who spent money only for a purpose
Though the minister continued gazing at the stiff presentments of local beauties and swains his eyes seemed to see salmonhued hollyhocks and spotted lilies instead
Suddenly a resolve came to him
He stood erect and faced his trustee
Speaking of the price of things he said with an effort of arrogance in his measured tone I have never had an opportunity before of mentioning the subject of the flowers you have so kindly furnished for myfor MY garden
Why mention it now
queried Gorringe with nonchalance
He turned his cigar about with a movement of his lips and worked it into the corner of his mouth
He did not find it necessary to look at Theron at all
Because began Mr Ware and then hesitatedbecausewell it raises a question of my being under obligation which I Oh no sir said the lawyer put that out of your mind
You are no more under obligation to me than I am to you
Oh no make yourself easy about that
Neither of us owes the other anything
Not even goodwillI take that to be your meaning retorted Theron with some heat
The words are yours sir responded Gorringe coolly
I do not object to them
As you like put in the other
If it be so why then all the more reason why I should under the circumstances Under what circumstances
interposed the lawyer
Let us be clear about this thing as we go along
To what circumstances do you refer
He had turned his eyes now and looked Theron in the face
A slight protrusion of his lower jaw had given the cigar an upward tilt under the black mustache
The circumstances are that you have brought or sent to my garden a great many very expensive flowerplants and bushes and so on
And you object
I had not supposed that clergymen in generaland you in particularwere so sensitive
Have donation parties then gone out of date
I understand your sneer well enough retorted Theron but that can pass
The main point is that you did me the honor to send these plantsor to smuggle them in but never once deigned to hint to me that you had done so
No one told me
Except by mere accident I should not have known to this day where they came from
Mr Gorringe twisted the cigar at another angle with lines of grim amusement about the corner of his mouth
I should have thought he said with dry deliberation that possibly this fact might have raised in your mind the conceivable hypothesis that the plants might not be intended for you at all
That is precisely it sir said Theron
There were people passing and he was forced to keep his voice down
It would have been a relief he felt to shout
That is it they were not intended for me
Well then what are you talking about
The lawyers speech had become abrupt almost to incivility
I think my remarks have been perfectly clear said the minister with dignity
It was a new experience to be addressed in that fashion
It occurred to him to add Please remember that I am not in the witnessbox to be bullied or insulted by a professional
Gorringe studied Therons face attentively with a cold searching scrutiny
You may thank your stars youre not
he said with significance
What on earth could he mean
The words and the menacing tone greatly impressed Theron
Indeed upon reflection he found that they frightened him
The disposition to adopt a high tone with the lawyer was melting away
I do not see he began and then deliberately allowed his voice to take on an injured and plaintive inflectionI do not see why you should adopt this tone toward me Brother Gorringe
The lawyer scowled and bit sharply into the cigar but said nothing
If I have unconsciously offended you in any way Theron went on I beg you to tell me how
I liked you from the beginning of my pastorate here and the thought that latterly we seemed to be drifting apart has given me much pain
But now it is still more distressing to find you actually disposed to quarrel with me
Surely Brother Gorringe between a pastor and a probationer who No Gorringe broke in quarrel isnt the word for it
There isnt any quarrel Mr
Ware
He stepped down from the doorstone to the sidewalk as he spoke and stood face to face with Theron
Workingmen with dinnerpails and factory girls were passing close to them and he lowered his voice to a sharp incisive halfwhisper as he added It wouldnt be worth any grown mans while to quarrel with so poor a creature as you are
Theron stood confounded with an empty stare of bewilderment on his face
It rose in his mind that the right thing to feel was rage righteous indignation fury but for the life of him he could not muster any manly anger
The character of the insult stupefied him
I do not know that I have anything to say to you in reply he remarked after what seemed to him a silence of minutes
His lips framed the words automatically but they expressed well enough the blank vacancy of his mind
The suggestion that anybody deemed him a poor creature grew more astounding incomprehensible as it swelled in his brain
No I suppose not snapped Gorringe
Youre not the sort to stand up to men your form is to go round the corner and take it out of somebody weaker than yourself a defenceless woman for instance
Ohho
said Theron
The exclamation had uttered itself
The sound of it seemed to clarify his muddled thoughts and as they ranged themselves in order he began to understand
Ohho
he said again and nodded his head in token of comprehension
The lawyer chewing his cigar with increased activity glared at him
What do you mean
he demanded peremptorily
Mean
said the minister
Oh nothing that I feel called upon to explain to you
It was passing strange but his selfpossession had all at once returned to him
As it became more apparent that the lawyer was losing his temper Theron found the courage to turn up the corners of his lips in show of a bitter little smile of confidence
He looked into the others dusky face and flaunted this smile at it in contemptuous defiance
It is not a subject that I can discuss with propriety at this stage he added
Damn you
Are you talking about those flowers
Oh I am not talking about anything in particular returned Theron not even the curious choice of language which my latest probationer seems to prefer
Go and strike my name off the list
said Gorringe with rising passion
I was a fool to ever have it there
To think of being a probationer of yoursmy God
That will be a pityfrom one point of view remarked Theron still with the ironical smile on his lips
You seemed to enter upon the new life with such deliberation and fixity of purpose too
I can imagine the regrets your withdrawal will cause in certain quarters
I only hope that it will not discourage those who accompanied you to the altar and shared your enthusiasm at the time
He had spoken throughout with studied slowness and an insolent nicety of utterance
You had better go away
broke forth Gorringe
If you dont I shall forget myself
For the first time
asked Theron
Then warned by the flash in the lawyers eye he turned on his heel and sauntered with a painstaking assumption of a mind quite at ease up the street
Gorringes own face twitched and his veins tingled as he looked after him
He spat the shapeless cigar out of his mouth into the gutter and drawing forth another from his pocket clenched it between his teeth his gaze following the tall form of the Methodist minister till it was merged in the crowd
Well Im damned
he said aloud to himself
The photographer had come down to take in his showcases for the night
He looked up from his task at the exclamation and grinned inquiringly
Ive just been talking to a man said the lawyer whos so much meaner than any other man I ever heard of that it takes my breath away
Hes got a wife thats as pure and good as gold and he knows it and she worships the ground he walks on and he knows that too
And yet the scoundrel is around trying to sniff out some shadow of a pretext for misusing her worse than hes already done
Yes sir hed be actually tickled to death if he could nose up some hint of a scandal about her something that he could pretend to believe and work for his own advantage to levy blackmail or get rid of her or whatever suited his book
I didnt think there was such an outandout cur on this whole footstool
I almost wish by God Id thrown him into the canal
Yes you lawyers must run against some pretty snide specimens remarked the photographer lifting one of the cases from its sockets
CHAPTER XXVI Theron spent half an hour in aimless strolling about the streets
From earliest boyhood his mind had always worked most clearly when he walked alone
Every mental process which had left a mark upon his memory and his career the daydreams of future academic greatness and fame which had fashioned themselves in his brain as a farm lad the meditations raptures and high resolves of his student period at the seminary the more notable sermons and powerful discourse by which he had revealed the genius that was in him to astonished and delighted assemblages all were associated in his retrospective thoughts with solitary rambles
He had a very direct and vivid consciousness now that it was good to be on his legs and alone
He had never in his life been more sensible of the charm of his own companionship
The encounter with Gorringe seemed to have cleared all the clouds out of his brain and restored lightness to his heart
After such an object lesson the impossibility of his continuing to sacrifice himself to a notion of duty to these lowminded and coarsenatured villagers was beyond all argument
There could no longer be any doubt about his moral right to turn his back upon them to wash his hands of the miserable combination of hypocrisy and hysterics which they called their spiritual life
And the question of Gorringe and Alice that too stood precisely where he wanted it
Even in his own thoughts he preferred to pursue it no further
Between them somewhere an offence of concealment it might be of conspiracy had been committed against him
It was no business of his to say more or to think more
He rested his case simply on the fact which could not be denied and which he was not in the least interested to have explained one way or the other
The recollection of Gorringes obvious disturbance of mind was especially pleasant to him
He himself had been magnanimous almost to the point of weakness
He had gone out of his way to call the man brother and to give him an opportunity of behaving like a gentleman but his kindly forbearance had been wasted
Gorringe was not the man to understand generous feelings much less rise to their level
He had merely shown that he would be vicious if he knew how
It was more important and satisfactory to recall that he had also shown a complete comprehension of the injured husbands grievance
The fact that he had recognized it was enoughwas in fact everything
In the background of his thoughts Theron had carried along a notion of going and dining with Father Forbes when the time for the evening meal should arrive
The idea in itself attracted him as a fitting capstone to his resolve not to go home to supper
It gave just the right kind of character to his domestic revolt
But when at last he stood on the doorstep of the pastorate waiting for an answer to the tinkle of the electric bell he had heard ring inside his mind contained only the single thought that now he should hear something about Celia
Perhaps he might even find her there but he put that suggestion aside as slightly unpleasant
The hagfaced housekeeper led him as before into the diningroom
It was still daylight and he saw on the glance that the priest was alone at the table with a book beside him to read from as he ate
Father Forbes rose and came forward greeting his visitor with profuse urbanity and smiles
If there was a perfunctory note in the invitation to sit down and share the meal Theron did not catch it
He frankly displayed his pleasure as he laid aside his hat and took the chair opposite his host
It is really only a few months since I was here in this room before he remarked as the priest closed his book and tossed it to one side and the housekeeper came in to lay another place
Yet it might have been years many long years so tremendous is the difference that the lapse of time has wrought in me
I am afraid we have nothing to tempt you very much Mr Ware remarked Father Forbes with a gesture of his plump white hand which embraced the dishes in the centre of the table
May I send you a bit of this boiled mutton
I have very homely tastes when I am by myself
I was saying Theron observed after some moments had passed in silence that I date such a tremendous revolution in my thoughts my beliefs my whole mind and character from my first meeting with you my first coming here
I dont know how to describe to you the enormous change that has come over me and I owe it all to you
I can only hope then that it is entirely of a satisfactory nature said the priest politely smiling
Oh it is so splendidly satisfactory
said Theron with fervor
I look back at myself now with wonder and pity
It seems incredible that such a little while ago I should have been such an ignorant and unimaginative clod of earth content with such petty ambitions and actually proud of my limitations
And you have larger ambitions now
asked the other
Pray let me help you to some potatoes
I am afraid that ambitions only get in our way and trip us up
We clergymen are like streetcar horses
The more steadily we jog along between the rails the better it is for us
Oh I dont intend to remain in the ministry declared Theron
The statement seemed to him a little bald now that he had made it and as his companion lifted his brows in surprise he added stumblingly That is as I feel now it seems to me impossible that I should remain much longer
With you of course it is different
You have a thousand things to interest and pleasantly occupy you in your work and its ceremonies so that mere belief or nonbelief in the dogma hardly matters
But in our church dogma is everything
If you take that away or cease to have its support the rest is intolerable hideous
Father Forbes cut another slice of mutton for himself
It is a pretty serious business to make such a change at your time of life
I take it for granted you will think it all over very carefully before you commit yourself
He said this with an almost indifferent air which rather chilled his listeners enthusiasm
Oh yes Theron made answer I shall do nothing rash
But I have a good many plans for the future
Father Forbes did not ask what these were and a brief further period of silence fell upon the table
I hope everything went off smoothly at the picnic Theron ventured at last
I have not seen any of you since then
The priest shook his head and sighed
No he said
It is a bad business
I have had a great deal of unhappiness out of it this past fortnight
That young man who was rude to youof course it was mere drunken irresponsible nonsense on his parthas got himself into a serious scrape Im afraid
It is being kept quite within the family and we hope to manage so that it will remain there but it has terribly upset his father and his sister
But that after all is not so hard to bear as the other affliction that has come upon the Maddens
You remember Michael the other brother
He seems to have taken cold that evening or perhaps overexerted himself
He has been seized with quick consumption
He will hardly last till snow flies
Oh I am GRIEVED to hear that
Theron spoke with tremulous earnestness
It seemed to him as if Michael were in some way related to him
It is very hard upon them all the priest went on
Michael is as sweet and holy a character as it is possible for any one to think of
He is the apple of his fathers eye
They were inseparable those two
Do you know the father Mr
Madden
Theron shook his head
I think I have seen him he said
A small man with gray whiskers
A peasant said Father Forbes but with a heart of gold
Poor man
he has had little enough out of his riches
Ah the West Coast people what tragedies I have seen among them over here
They have rudimentary lung organizations like a frogs to fit the mild wet soft air they live in
The sharp air here kills them off like flies in a frost
Whole families go
I should think there are a dozen of old Jeremiahs children in the cemetery
If Michael could have passed his twentyeighth year there would have been hope for him at least till his thirtyfifth
These pulmonary things seem to go by sevens you know
I didnt know said Theron
It is very strange and very sad
His startled mind was busy all at once with conjectures as to Celias age
The sisterMiss Maddenseems extremely strong he remarked tentatively
Celia may escape the general doom said the priest
His guest noted that he clenched his shapely white hand on the table as he spoke and that his gentle carefully modulated voice had a gritty hardness in its tone
THAT would be too dreadful to think of he added
Theron shuddered in silence and strove to shut his mind against the thought
She has taken Michaels illness so deeply to heart the priest proceeded and devoted herself to him so untiringly that I get a little nervous about her
I have been urging her to go away and get a change of air and scene if only for a few days
She does not sleep well and that is always a bad thing
I think I remember her telling me once that sometimes she had sleepless spells said Theron
She said that then she banged on her piano at all hours or dragged the cushions about from room to room like a wild woman
A very interesting young lady dont you find her so
Father Forbes let a wan smile play on his lips
What our Celia
he said
Interesting
Why Mr Ware there is no one like her in the world
She is as unique as what shall I sayas the Irish are among races
Her father and mother were both born in mudcabins and she she might be the daughter of a hundred kings except that they seem mostly rather underwitted than otherwise
She always impresses me as a sort of atavistic idealization of the old Kelt at his finest and best
There in Ireland you got a strange mixture of elementary early peoples walled off from the outer world by the four seas and free to work out their own racial amalgam on their own lines
They brought with them at the outset a great inheritance of Eastern mysticism
Others lost it but the Irish all alone on their island kept it alive and brooded on it and rooted their whole spiritual side in it
Their religion is full of it their blood is full of it our Celia is fuller of it than anybody else
The Ireland of two thousand years ago is incarnated in her
They are the merriest people and the saddest the most turbulent and the most docile the most talented and the most unproductive the most practical and the most visionary the most devout and the most pagan
These impossible contradictions war ceaselessly in their blood
When I look at Celia I seem to see in my minds eye the fair youngancestral mother of them all
Theron gazed at the speaker with open admiration
I love to hear you talk he said simply
An unbidden memory flitted upward in his mind
Those were the very words that Alice had so often on her lips in their old courtship days
How curious it was
He looked at the priest and had a quaint sensation of feeling as a romantic woman must feel in the presence of a specially impressive masculine personality
It was indeed strange that this softvoiced portly creature in a gown with his white fat hands and his feline suavity of manner should produce such a commanding and unique effect of virility
No doubt this was a part of the great sex mystery which historically surrounded the figure of the celibate priest as with an atmosphere
Women had always been prostrating themselves before it
Theron watching his companions full pallid face in the lamplight tried to fancy himself in the priests place looking down upon these worshipping female forms
He wondered what the celibates attitude really was
The enigma fascinated him
Father Forbes after his rhetorical outburst and been eating
He pushed aside his cheeseplate
I grow enthusiastic on the subject of my race sometimes he remarked with the suggestion of an apology
But I make up for it other timesmost of the timeby scolding them
If it were not such a noble thing to be an Irishman it would be ridiculous
Ah said Theron deprecatingly who would not be enthusiastic in talking of Miss Madden
What you said about her was perfect
As you spoke I was thinking how proud and thankful we ought to be for the privilege of knowing herwe who do know her wellalthough of course your friendship with her is vastly more intimate than mine than mine could ever hope to be
The priest offered no comment and Theron went on I hardly know how to describe the remarkable impression she makes upon me
I cant imagine to myself any other young woman so brilliant or broad in her views or so courageous
Of course her being so rich makes it easier for her to do just what she wants to do but her bravery is astonishing all the same
We had a long and very sympathetic talk in the woods that day of the picnic after we left you
I dont know whether she spoke to you about it
Father Forbes made a movement of the head and eyes which seemed to negative the suggestion
Her talk continued Theron gave me quite new ideas of the range and capacity of the female mind
I wonder that everybody in Octavius isnt full of praise and admiration for her talents and exceptional character
In such a small town as this you would think she would be the centre of attentionthe pride of the place
I think she has as much praise as is good for her remarked the priest quietly
And heres a thing that puzzles me pursued Mr Ware
I was immensely surprised to find that Dr Ledsmar doesnt even think she is smartor at least he professes the utmost intellectual contempt for her and says he dislikes her into the bargain
But of course she dislikes him too so thats only natural
But I cant understand his denying her great ability
The priest smiled in a dubious way
Dont borrow unnecessary alarm about that Mr Ware he said with studied smoothness of modulated tones
These two good friends of mine have much enjoyment out of the idea that they are fighting for the mastery over my poor unstable character
It has grown to be a habit with them and a hobby as well and they pursue it with tireless zest
There are not many intellectual diversions open to us here and they make the most of this one
It amuses them and it is not without its charms for me in my capacity as an interested observer
It is a part of the game that they should pretend to themselves that they detest each other
In reality I fancy that they like each other very much
At any rate there is nothing to be disturbed about
His mellifluous tones had somehow the effect of suggesting to Theron that he was an outsider and would better mind his own business
Ah if this purring pussycat of a priest only knew how little of an outsider he really was
The thought gave him an easy selfcontrol
Of course he said our warm mutual friendship makes the observation of these little individual vagaries merely a part of a delightful whole
I should not dream of discussing Miss Maddens confidences to me or the doctors either outside our own little group
Father Forbes reached behind him and took from a chair his black threecornered cap with the tassel
Unfortunately I have a sick call waiting me he said gathering up his gown and slowly rising
Yes I saw the man sitting in the hall remarked Theron getting to his feet
I would ask you to go upstairs and wait the priest went on but my return unhappily is quite uncertain
Another evening I may be more fortunate
I am leaving town tomorrow for some days but when I get back The polite sentence did not complete itself
Father Forbes had come out into the hall giving a cool nod to the workingman who rose from the bench as they passed and shook hands with his guest on the doorstep
When the door had closed upon Mr Ware the priest turned to the man
You have come about those frames he said
If you will come upstairs I will show you the prints and you can give me a notion of what can be done with them
I rather fancy the idea of a triptych in carved old English if you can manage it
After the workman had gone away Father Forbes put on slippers and an old loose soutane lighted a cigar and pushing an easychair over to the reading lamp sat down with a book
Then something occurred to him and he touched the housebell at his elbow
Maggie he said gently when the housekeeper appeared at the door I will have the coffee and FINE CHAMPAGNE up here if it is no trouble
Andoh MaggieI was compelled this evening to turn the blameless visit of the framemaker into a venial sin and that involves a needless wear and tear of conscience
I think thathereafteryou understand I am not invariably at home when the Rev
Mr Ware does me the honor to call
CHAPTER XXVII That night brought the first frost of the season worth counting
In the morning when Theron came downstairs his casual glance through the window caught a desolate picture of blackened dahlia stalks and shrivelled blooms
The gayety and color of the garden were gone and in their place was shabby and dishevelled ruin
He flung the sash up and leaned out
The nipping autumn air was good to breathe
He looked about him surveying the havoc the frost had wrought among the flowers and smiled
At breakfast he smiled againa mirthless and calculated smile
I see that Brother Gorringes flowers have come to grief over night he remarked
Alice looked at him before she spoke and saw on his face a confirmation of the hostile hint in his voice
She nodded in a constrained way and said nothing
Or rather I should say Theron went on with deliberate words the late Brother Gorringes flowers
How do you meanLATE asked his wife swiftly
Oh calm yourself
replied the husband
He is not dead
He has only intimated to me his desire to sever his connection
I may add that he did so in a highly offensive manner
I am very sorry said Alice in a low tone and with her eyes on her plate
I took it for granted you would be grieved at his backsliding remarked Theron making his phrases as pointed as he could
He was such a promising probationer and you took such a keen interest in his spiritual awakening
But the frost has nipped his zealalong with the hundred or more dollars worth of flowers by which he testified his faith
I find something interesting in their having been blasted simultaneously
Alice dropped all pretence of interest in her breakfast
With a flushed face and lips tightly compressed she made a movement as if to rise from her chair
Then changing her mind she sat bolt upright and faced her husband
I think we had better have this out right now she said in a voice which Theron hardly recognized
You have been hinting round the subject long enoughtoo long
There are some things nobody is obliged to put up with and this is one of them
You will oblige me by saying out in so many words what it is you are driving at
The outburst astounded Theron
He laid down his knife and fork and gazed at his wife in frank surprise
She had so accustomed him of late to a demeanor almost abject in its depressed docility that he had quite forgotten the Alice of the old days when she had spirit and courage enough for two and a notable tongue of her own
The flash in her eyes and the lines of resolution about her mouth and chin for a moment daunted him
Then he observed by a flutter of the frill at her wrist that she was trembling
I am sure I have nothing to say out in so many words as you put it he replied forcing his voice into cool impassive tones
I merely commented upon a coincidence that was all
If for any reason under the sun the subject chances to be unpleasant to you I have no earthly desire to pursue it
But I insist upon having it pursued
returned Alice
Ive had just all I can stand of your insinuations and innuendoes and its high time we had some plain talk
Ever since the revival you have been dropping sly underhand hints about Mr Gorringe andand me
Now I ask you what you mean by it
Yes there was a shake in her voice and he could see how her bosom heaved in a tremor of nervousness
It was easy for him to be very calm
It is you who introduce these astonishing suggestions not I he replied coldly
It is you who couple your name with hissomewhat to my surprise I admit but let me suggest that we drop the subject
You are excited just now and you might say things that you would prefer to leave unsaid
It would surely be better for all concerned to say no more about it
Alice staring across the table at him with knitted brows emitted a sharp little snort of indignation
Well I never
Theron I wouldnt have thought it of you
There are so many things you wouldnt have thought on such a variety of subjects he observed with a show of resuming his breakfast
But why continue
We are only angering each other
Never mind that she replied with more control over her speech
I guess things have come to a pass where a little anger wont do any harm
I have a right to insist on knowing what you mean by your insinuations
Theron sighed
Why will you keep harping on the thing
he asked wearily
I have displayed no curiosity
I dont ask for any explanations
I think I mentioned that the man had behaved insultingly to mebut that doesnt matter
I dont bring it up as a grievance
I am very well able to take care of myself I have no wish to recur to the incident in any way
So far as I am concerned the topic is dismissed
Listen to me
broke in Alice with eager gravity
She hesitated as he looked up with a nod of attention and reflected as well as she was able among her thoughts for a minute or two
This is what I want to say to you
Ever since we came to this hateful Octavius you and I have been drifting apartor no that doesnt express itsimply rushing away from each other
It only began last spring and now the space between us is so wide that we are worse than complete strangers
For strangers at least dont hate each other and Ive had a good many occasions lately to see that you positively do hate me What grotesque absurdity interposed Theron impatiently
No it isnt absurdity its gospel truth retorted Alice
Anddont interrupt methere have been times too when I have had to ask myself if I wasnt getting almost to hate you in return
I tell you this frankly
Yes you are undoubtedly frank commented the husband toying with his teaspoon
A hypercritical person might consider almost too frank
Alice scanned his face closely while he spoke and held her breath as if in expectant suspense
Her countenance clouded once more
You dont realize Theron she said gravely your voice when you speak to me your look your manner they have all changed
You are like another man some man who never loved me and doesnt even know me much less like me
I want to know what the end of it is to be
Up to the time of your sickness last summer until after the Soulsbys went away I didnt let myself get downright discouraged
It seemed too monstrous for belief that you should go away out of my life like that
It didnt seem possible that God could allow such a thing
It came to me that I had been lax in my Christian life especially in my position as a ministers wife and that this was my punishment
I went to the altar to intercede with Him and to try to loose my burden at His feet
But nothing has come of it
I got no help from you
Really Alice broke in Theron I explained over and over again to you how preoccupied I waswith the book and affairs generally
I got no assistance from Heaven either she went on declining the diversion he offered
I dont want to talk impiously but if there is a God he has forgotten me his poor heartbroken handmaiden
You are talking impiously Alice observed her husband
And you are doing me cruel injustice into the bargain
I only wish I were
she replied I only wish to God I were
Well then accept my complete assurance that you ARE that your whole conception of me and of what you are pleased to describe as my change toward you is an entire and utter mistake
Of course the married state is no more exempt from the universal law of growth development alteration than any other human institution
On its spiritual side of course viewed either as a sacrament or as Dont let us go into that interposed Alice abruptly
In fact there is no good in talking any more at all
It is as if we didnt speak the same language
You dont understand what I say it makes no impression upon your mind
Quite to the contrary he assured her I have been deeply interested and concerned in all you have said
I think you are laboring under a great delusion and I have tried my best to convince you of it but I have never heard you speak more intelligibly or I might say effectively
A little gleam of softness stole over Alices face
If you only gave me a little more credit for intelligence she said you would find that I am not such a blockhead as you think I am
Come come
he said with a smiling show of impatience
You really mustnt impute things to me wholesale like that
She was glad to answer the smile in kind
No but truly she pleaded you dont realize it but you have grown into a way of treating me as if I had absolutely no mind at all
You have a very admirable mind he responded and took up his teaspoon again
She reached for his cup and poured out hot coffee for him
An almost cheerful spirit had suddenly descended upon the breakfast table
And now let me say the thing I have been aching to say for months she began in less burdened voice
He lifted his brows
Havent things been discussed pretty fully already
he asked
The doubtful harassed expression clouded upon her face at his words and she paused
No she said resolutely after an instants reflection it is my duty to discuss this too
It is a misunderstanding all round
You remember that I told you Mr Gorringe had given me some plants which he got from some garden or other
If you really wish to go on with the subjectyes I have a recollection of that particular falsehood of his
He did it with the kindest and friendliest motives in the world
protested Alice
He saw how downinthemouth and moping I was here among these strangers and I really was getting quite peaked and rundown and he said I stayed indoors too much and it would do me all sorts of good to work in the garden and he would send me some plants
The next I knew here they were with a book about mixing soils and planting and so on
When I saw him next and thanked him I suppose I showed some apprehension about his having laid out money on them and he just to ease my mind invented the story about his getting them for nothing
When I found out the truth I got it out of that boy Harvey Semplehe admitted it quite franklysaid he was wrong to deceive me
This was in the fine first fervor of his term of probation I suppose put in Theron
He made no effort to dissemble the sneer in his voice
Well answered Alice with a touch of acerbity I have told you now and it is off my mind
There never would have been the slightest concealment about it if you hadnt begun by keeping me at arms length and making it next door to impossible to speak to you at all and if And if he hadnt lied
Theron as he finished her sentence for her rose from the table
Dallying for a brief moment by his chair there seemed the magnetic premonition in the air of some further and kindlier word
Then he turned and walked sedately into the next room and closed the door behind him
The talk was finished and Alice left alone passed the knuckle of her thumb over one swimming eye and then the other and bit her lips and swallowed down the sob that rose in her throat
CHAPTER XXVIII It was early afternoon when Theron walked out of his yard bestowing no glance upon the withered and tarnished show of the garden and started with a definite step down the street
The tendency to ruminative loitering which those who saw him abroad always associated with his tall spare figure was not suggested today
He moved forward like a man with a purpose
All the forenoon in the seclusion of the sittingroom with a book opened before him he had been thinking hard
It was not the talk with Alice that occupied his thoughts
That rose in his mind from time to time only as a disagreeable blur and he refused to dwell upon it
It was nothing to him he said to himself what Gorringes motives in lying had been
As for Alice he hardened his heart against her
Just now it was her mood to try and make up to him
But it had been something different yesterday and who could say what it would be tomorrow
He really had passed the limit of patience with her shifting emotional vagaries now lurching in this direction now in that
She had had her chance to maintain a hold upon his interest and imagination and had let it slip
These were the accidents of life the inevitable harsh happenings in the great tragedy of Nature
They could not be helped and there was nothing more to be said
He had bestowed much more attention upon what the priest had said the previous evening
He passed in review all the glowing tributes Father Forbes had paid to Celia
They warmed his senses as he recalled them but they also in a curious indefinite way caused him uneasiness
There had been a personal fervor about them which was something more than priestly
He remembered how the priest had turned pale and faltered when the question whether Celia would escape the general doom of her family came up
It was not a merely pastoral agitation that he felt sure
A hundred obscure hints doubts stray little suspicions crowded upward together in his thoughts
It became apparent to him now that from the outset he had been conscious of something queeryes from that very first day when he saw the priest and Celia together and noted their glance of recognition inside the house of death
He realized now upon reflection that the tone of other people his own parishioners and his casual acquaintances in Octavius alike had always had a certain note of reservation in it when it touched upon Miss Madden
Her running in and out of the pastorate at all hours the way the priest patted her on the shoulder before others the obvious dislike the priests ugly old housekeeper bore her the astonishing freedom of their talk with each otherthese dark memories loomed forth out of a mass of sinister conjecture
He could bear the uncertainty no longer
Was it indeed not entirely his own fault that it had existed thus long
No man with the spirit of a mouse would have shillyshallied in this preposterous fashion week after week with the fever of a beautiful womans kiss in his blood and the woman herself living only round the corner
The whole world had been as good as offered to hima bewildering world of wealth and beauty and spiritual exaltation and love and he like a weak fool had waited for it to be brought to him on a salver as it were and actually forced upon his acceptance
That is my failing he reflected these miserable ecclesiastical bandages of mine have dwarfed my manly side
The meanest of Thurstons clerks would have shown a more adventurous spirit and a bolder nerve
If I do not act at once with courage and resolution everything will be lost
Already she must think me unworthy of the honor it was in her sweet will to bestow
Then he remembered that she was now always at home
Not another hour of foolish indecision
he whispered to himself
I will put my destiny to the test
I will see her today
A middleaged plainfaced servant answered his ring at the doorbell of the Madden mansion
She was palpably Irish and looked at him with a saddened preoccupation in her gray eyes holding the door only a little ajar
Theron had got out one of his cards
I wish to make inquiry about young Mr MaddenMr Michael Madden he said holding the card forth tentatively
I have only just heard of his illness and it has been a great grief to me
He is no better answered the woman briefly
I am the Rev
Mr Ware he went on and you may say that if he is well enough I should be glad to see him
The servant peered out at him with a suddenly altered expression then shook her head
I dont think he would be wishing to see YOU she replied
It was evident from her tone that she suspected the visitors intentions
Theron smiled in spite of himself
I have not come as a clergyman he explained but as a friend of the family
If you will tell Miss Madden that I am here it will do just as well
Yes we wont bother him
If you will kindly hand my card to his sister
When the domestic turned at this and went in Theron felt like throwing his hat in the air there where he stood
The womans churlish sectarian prejudices had played ideally into his hands
In no other imaginable way could he have asked for Celia so naturally
He wondered a little that a servant at such a grand house as this should leave callers standing on the doorstep
Still more he wondered what he should say to the lady of his dream when he came into her presence
Will you please to walk this way
The woman had returned
She closed the door noiselessly behind him and led the way not up the sumptuous staircase as Theron had expected but along through the broad hall past several large doors to a small curtained archway at the end
She pushed aside this curtain and Theron found himself in a sort of conservatory full of the hot vague light of sunshine falling through groundglass
The air was moist and close and heavy with the smell of verdure and wet earth
A tall bank of palms with ferns sprawling at their base reared itself directly in front of him
The floor was of mosaic and he saw now that there were rugs upon it and that there were chairs and sofas and other signs of habitation
It was indeed only half a greenhouse for the lower part of it was in rosewood panels with floral paintings on them like a room
Moving to one side of the barrier of palms he discovered to his great surprise the figure of Michael sitting propped up with pillows in a huge easychair
The sick man was looking at him with big gravely intent eyes
His face did not show as much change as Theron had in fancy pictured
It had seemed almost as bony and cadaverous on the day of the picnic
The hands spread out on the chairarms were very white and thin though and the gaze in the blue eyes had a spectral quality which disturbed him
Michael raised his right hand and Theron stepping forward took it limply in his for an instant
Then he laid it down again
The touch of people about to die had always been repugnant to him
He could feel on his own warm palm the very damp of the grave
I only heard from Father Forbes last evening of your your illhealth he said somewhat hesitatingly
He seated himself on a bench beneath the palms facing the invalid but still holding his hat
I hope very sincerely that you will soon be all right again
My sister is lying down in her room answered Michael
He had not once taken his sombre and embarrassing gaze from the others face
The voice in which he uttered this uncalledfor remark was thin in fibre cold and impassive
It fell upon Therons ears with a suggestion of hidden meaning
He looked uneasily into Michaels eyes and then away again
They seemed to be looking straight through him and there was no shirking the sensation that they saw and comprehended things with an unnatural prescience
I hope she is feeling better Theron found himself saying
Father Forbes mentioned that she was a little under the weather
I dined with him last night
I am glad that you came said Michael after a little pause
His earnest unblinking eyes seemed to supplement his tongue with speech of their own
I do be thinking a great deal about you
I have matters to speak of to you now that you are here
Theron bowed his head gently in token of grateful attention
He tried the experiment of looking away from Michael but his glance went back again irresistibly and fastened itself upon the sick mans gaze and clung there
I am next door to a dead man he went on paying no heed to the others deprecatory gesture
It is not years or months with me but weeks
Then I go away to stand up for judgment on my sins and if it is His merciful will I shall see God
So I say my goodbyes now and so you will let me speak plainly and not think ill of what I say
You are much changed Mr Ware since you came to Octavius and it is not a change for the good
Theron lifted his brows in unaffected surprise and put inquiry into his glance
I dont know if Protestants will be saved in Gods good time or not continued Michael
I find there are different opinions among the clergy about that and of course it is not for me only a plain mechanic to be sure where learned and pious scholars are in doubt
But I am sure about one thing
Those Protestants and others too mind you who profess and preach good deeds and themselves do bad deedsthey will never be saved
They will have no chance at all to escape hellfire
I think we are all agreed upon that Mr Madden said Theron with surface suavity
Then I say to you Mr Ware you are yourself in a bad path
Take the warning of a dying man sir and turn from it
The impulse to smile tugged at Therons facial muscles
This was really too droll
He looked up at the ceiling the while he forced his countenance into a polite composure then turned again to Michael with some conciliatory commonplace ready for utterance
But he said nothing and all suggestion of levity left his mind under the searching inspection bent upon him by the young mans hollow eyes
What did Michael suspect
What did he know
What was he hinting at in this strange talk of his
I saw you often on the street when first you came here continued Michael
I knew the man who was here before you that is by sightand he was not a good man
But your face when you came pleased me
I liked to look at you
I was tormented just then do you see that so many decent kindly people old schoolmates and friends and neighbors of mineand for that matter others all over the country must lose their souls because they were Protestants
At my boyhood and young manhood that thought took the joy out of me
Sometimes I usent to sleep a whole night long for thinking that some lad I had been playing with perhaps in his own house that very day would be taken when he died and his mother too when she died and thrown into the flames of hell for all eternity
It made me so unhappy that finally I wouldnt go to any Protestant boys house and have his mother be nice to me and give me cake and applesand me thinking all the while that they were bound to be damned no matter how good they were to me
The primitive humanity of this touched Theron and he nodded approbation with a tender smile in his eyes forgetting for the moment that a personal application of the monologue had been hinted at
But then later as I grew up the sick man went on I learned that it was not altogether certain
Some of the authorities I found maintained that it was doubtful and some said openly that there must be salvation possible for good people who lived in ignorance of the truth through no fault of their own
Then I had hope one day and no hope the next and as I did my work I thought it over and in the evenings my father and I talked it over and we settled nothing of it at all
Of course how could we
Did you ever discuss the question with your sister
it occurred suddenly to Theron to interpose
He was conscious of some daring in doing so and he fancied that Michaels drawn face clouded a little at his words
My sister is no theologian he answered briefly
Women have no call to meddle with such matters
But I was sayingit was in the middle of these doubtings of mine that you came here to Octavius and I noticed you on the streets and once in the eveningI made no secret of it to my peopleI sat in the back of your church and heard you preach
As I say I liked you
It was your face and what I thought it showed of the man underneath it that helped settle my mind more than anything else
I said to myself Here is a young man only about my own age and he has education and talents and he does not seek to make money for himself or a great name but he is content to live humbly on the salary of a bookkeeper and devote all his time to prayer and the meditation of his religion and preaching and visiting the sick and the poor and comforting them
His very face is a pleasure and a help for those in suffering and trouble to look at
The very sight of it makes one believe in pure thoughts and merciful deeds
I will not credit it that God intends damning such a man as that or any like him
Theron bowed with a slow hesitating gravity of manner and deep not wholly complacent attention on his face
Evidently all this was by way of preparation for something unpleasant
That was only last spring said Michael
His tired voice sank for a sentence or two into a meditative halfwhisper
And it was MY last spring of all
I shall not be growing weak any more or drawing hard breaths when the first warm weather comes
It will be one season to me hereafter always the same
He lifted his voice with perceptible effort
I am talking too much
The rest I can say in a word
Only half a year has gone by and you have another face on you entirely
I had noticed the small changes before one by one
I saw the great change all of a sudden the day of the picnic
I see it a hundred times more now as you sit there
If it seemed to me like the face of a saint before it is more like the face of a barkeeper now
This was quite too much
Theron rose flushed to the temples and scowled down at the helpless man in the chair
He swallowed the sharp words which came uppermost and bit and moistened his lips as he forced himself to remember that this was a dying man and Celias brother to whom she was devoted and whom he himself felt he wanted to be very fond of
He got the shadow of a smile on to his countenance
I fear you HAVE tired yourself unduly he said in as noncontentious a tone as he could manage
He even contrived a little deprecatory laugh
I am afraid your real quarrel is with the air of Octavius
It agrees with me so wonderfullyI am getting as fat as a seal
But I do hope I am not paying for it by such a wholesale deterioration inside
If my own opinion could be of any value I should assure you that I feel myself an infinitely better and broader and stronger man than I was when I came here
Michael shook his head dogmatically
That is the greatest pity of all he said with renewed earnestness
You are entirely deceived about yourself
You do not at all realize how you have altered your direction or where you are going
It was a great misfortune for you sir that you did not keep among your own people
That poor halfbrother of mine though the drink was in him when he said that same to you never spoke a truer word
Keep among your own people Mr Ware
When you go among othersyou know what I mean you have no proper understanding of what their sayings and doings really mean
You do not realize that they are held up by the power of the true Church as a little child learning to walk is held up with a belt by its nurse
They can say and do things and no harm at all come to them which would mean destruction to you because they have help and you are walking alone
And so be said by me Mr Ware
Go back to the way you were brought up in and leave alone the people whose ways are different from yours
You are a married man and you are the preacher of a religion such as it is
There can be nothing better for you than to go and strive to be a good husband and to set a good example to the people of your Church who look up to youand mix yourself up no more with outside people and outside notions that only do you mischief
And that is what I wanted to say to you
Theron took up his hat
I take in all kindness what you have felt it your duty to say to me Mr Madden he said
I am not sure that I have altogether followed you but I am very sure you mean it well
I mean well by you replied Michael wearily moving his head on the pillow and speaking in an undertone of languor and pain and I mean well by others that are nearer to me and that I have a right to care more about
When a man lies by the site of his open grave he does not be meaning ill to any human soul
Yesthanksquite so
faltered Theron
He dallied for an instant with the temptation to seek some further explanation but the sight of Michaels halfclosed eyes and wornout expression decided him against it
It did not seem to be expected either that he should shake hands and with a few perfunctory words of hope for the invalids recovery which fell with a jarring note of falsehood upon his own ears he turned and left the room
As he did so Michael touched a bell on the table beside him
Theron drew a long breath in the hall as the curtain fell behind him
It was an immense relief to escape from the oppressive humidity and heat of the flowerroom and from that ridiculous bore of a Michael as well
The middleaged gravefaced servant warned by the bell stood waiting to conduct him to the door
I am sorry to have missed Miss Madden he said to her
She must be quite worn out
Perhaps later in the day She will not be seeing anybody today returned the woman
She is going to New York this evening and she is taking some rest against the journey
Will she be away long
he asked mechanically
The servants answer I have no idea hardly penetrated his consciousness at all
He moved down the steps and along the gravel to the street in a maze of mental confusion
When he reached the sidewalk under the familiar elms he paused and made a definite effort to pull his thoughts together and take stock of what had happened of what was going to happen but the thing baffled him
It was as if some drug had stupefied his faculties
He began to walk and gradually saw that what he was thinking about was the fact of Celias departure for New York that evening
He stared at this fact at first in its nakedness then clothed with reassuring suggestions that this was no doubt a trip she very often made
There was a blind sense of comfort in this idea and he rested himself upon it
Yes of course she travelled a great deal
New York must be as familiar to her as Octavius was to him
Her going there now was quite a matter of coursethe most natural thing in the world
Then there burst suddenly uppermost in his mind the other factthat Father Forbes was also going to New York that evening
The two things spindled upward side by side yet separately in his mental vision then they twisted and twined themselves together
He followed their convolutions miserably walking as if his eyes were shut
In slow fashion matters defined and arranged themselves before him
The process of tracing their sequence was all torture but there was no possibility no notion of shirking any detail of the pain
The priest had spoken of his efforts to persuade Celia to go away for a few days for rest and change of air and scene
He must have known only too well that she was going but of that he had been careful to drop no hint
The possibility of accident was too slight to be worth considering
People on such intimate terms as Celia and the priestpeople with such facilities for seeing each other whenever they desired did not find themselves on the same train of cars with the same long journey in view by mere chance
Theron walked until dusk began to close in upon the autumn day
It grew colder as he turned his face homeward
He wondered if it would freeze again overnight and then remembered the shrivelled flowers in his wifes garden
For a moment they shaped themselves in a picture before his minds eye he saw their blackened foliage their sicklied drooping stalks and wilted blooms and as he looked they restored themselves to the vigor and grace and richness of color of summertime as vividly as if they had been painted on a canvas
Or no the picture he stared at was not on canvas but on the glossy varnished panel of a luxurious sleepingcar
He shook his head angrily and blinked his eyes again and again to prevent their seeing seated together in the open window above this panel the two people he knew were there gloved and habited for the nights journey waiting for the train to start
Very much to my surprise he found himself saying to Alice watching her nervously as she laid the suppertable I find I must go to Albany tonight
That is it isnt absolutely necessary for that matter but I think it may easily turn out to be greatly to my advantage to go
Something has arisenI cant speak about it as yet but the sooner I see the Bishop about it the better
Things like that occur in a mans life where boldly striking out a line of action and following it up without an instants delay may make all the difference in the world to him
Tomorrow it might be too late and besides I can be home the sooner again
Alices face showed surprise but no trace of suspicion
She spoke with studied amiability during the meal and deferred with such unexpected tact to his implied desire not to be questioned as to the mysterious motives of the journey that his mood instinctively softened and warmed toward her as they finished supper
He smiled a little
I do hope I shant have to go on tomorrow to New York but these Bishops of ours are such gadabouts one never knows where to catch them
As like as not Sanderson may be down in New York on BookConcern business or something and if he is I shall have to chase him up
But after all perhaps the trip will do me goodthe change of air and scene you know
Im sure I hope so said Alice honestly enough
If you do go on to New York I suppose youll go by the riverboat
Everybody talks so much of that beautiful sail down the Hudson
Thats an idea
exclaimed Theron welcoming it with enthusiasm
It hadnt occurred to me
If I do have to go and it is as lovely as they make out the next time I promise I wont go without you my girl
I HAVE been rather out of sorts lately he continued
When I come back I daresay I shall be feeling better more like my old self
Then Im going to try Alice to be nicer to you than I have been of late
Im afraid there was only too much truth in what you said this morning
Never mind what I said this morningor any other time broke in Alice softly
Dont ever remember it again Theron if onlyonly He rose as she spoke moved round the table to where she sat and bending over her stopped the faltering sentence with a kiss
When was it he wondered that he had last kissed her
It seemed years ages ago
An hour later with hat and overcoat on and his valise in his hand he stood on the doorstep of the parsonage and kissed her once more before he turned and descended into the darkness
He felt like whistling as his feet sounded firmly on the plank sidewalk beyond the gate
It seemed as if he had never been in such capital good spirits before in his life
CHAPTER XXIX The train was at a standstill somewhere and the dull ashen beginnings of daylight had made a first feeble start toward effacing the lamps in the carroof when the new day opened for Theron
A man who had just come in stopped at the seat upon which he had been stretched through the night and tapping him brusquely on the knee said Im afraid I must trouble you sir
After a moment of sleepburdened confusion he sat up and the man took the other half of the seat and opened a newspaper still damp from the press
It was morning then
Theron rubbed a clear space upon the clouded window with his thumb and looked out
There was nothing to be seen but a broad stretch of tracks and beyond this the shadowed outlines of wagons and machinery in a yard with a background of factory buildings
The atmosphere in the car was vile beyond belief
He thought of opening the window but feared that the peremptorylooking man with the paper who had wakened him and made him sit up might object
They were the only people in the car who were sitting up
Backwards and forwards on either side of the narrow aisle the dim light disclosed recumbent forms curled uncomfortably into corners or sprawling at difficult angles which involved the least interference with one another
Here and there an upturned face gave a livid patch of surface for the mingled play of the gray dawn and the yellow lamplight
A ceaseless noise of snoring was in the air
He got up and walked to the tank of icewater at the end of the aisle and took a drink from the most inaccessible portion of the common tincups rim
The happy idea of going out on the platform struck him and he acted upon it
The morning air was deliciously cool and fresh by contrast and he filled his lungs with it again and again
Standing here he could discern beyond the buildings to the right the faint purplish outlines of great rounded hills
Some workmen one of them bearing a torch were crouching along under the side of the train pounding upon the resonant wheels with small hammers
He recalled having heard the same sound in the watches of the night during a prolonged halt
Some one had said it was Albany
He smiled in spite of himself at the thought that Bishop Sanderson would never know about the visit he had missed
Swinging himself to the ground he bent sidewise and looked forward down the long train
There were five six perhaps more sleepingcars on in front
Which one of them he wonderedand then there came the sharp All aboard
from the other side and he bundled up the steps again and entered the car as the train slowly resumed its progress
He was wideawake now and quite at his ease
He took his seat and diverted himself by winking gravely at a little child facing him on the next seat but one
There were four other children in the family party encamped about the tired and still sleeping mother whose back was turned to Theron
He recalled now having noticed this poor woman last night in the first stage of his journey how she fed her brood from one of the numerous baskets piled under their feet and brought water in a tin dish of her own from the tank to use in washing their faces with a rag and loosened their clothes to dispose them for the nights sleep
The face of the woman her manner and slatternly aspect and the general effect of her belongings bespoke squalid ignorance and poverty
Watching her Theron had felt curiously interested in the performance
In one sense it was scarcely more human than the spectacle of a cat licking her kittens or a cow giving suck to her calf
Yet in another was there anything more human
The child who had wakened before the rest regarded him with placidity declining to be amused by his winkings but exhibiting no other emotion
She had been playing by herself with a couple of buttons tied on a string and after giving a civil amount of attention to Therons grimaces she turned again to the superior attractions of this toy
Her selfpossession her capacity for selfentertainment the care she took not to arouse the others all impressed him very much
He felt in his pocket for a small coin and reaching forward offered it to her
She took it calmly bestowed a tranquil gaze upon him for a moment and went back to the buttons
Her indifference produced an unpleasant sensation upon him somehow and he rubbed the steaming window clear again and stared out of it
The wide river lay before him flanked by a precipitous wall of cliffs which he knew instantly must be the Palisades
There was an advertisement painted on them which he tried in vain to read
He was surprised to find they interested him so slightly
He had heard all his life of the Hudson and especially of it just at this point
The reality seemed to him almost commonplace
His failure to be thrilled depressed him for the moment
I suppose those ARE the Palisades
he asked his neighbor
The man glanced up from his paper nodded and made as if to resume his reading
But his eye had caught something in the prospect through the window which arrested his attention
By George
he exclaimed and lifted himself to get a clearer view
What is it
asked Theron peering forth as well
Nothing only Barclay Wendovers yacht is still there
Theres been a hitch of some sort
They were to have left yesterday
Is that itthat long black thing
queried Theron
That cant be a yacht can it
What do you think it is
answered the other
They were looking at a slim narrow hull lying at anchor silent and motionless on the drab expanse of water
If that aint a yacht they havent begun building any yet
Theyre taking her over to the Mediterranean for a cruise you knowaround India and Japan for the winter and home by the South Sea islands
Friend o mines in the party
Wouldnt mind the trip myself
But do you mean to say asked Theron that that little shell of a thing can sail across the ocean
Why how many people would she hold
The man laughed
Well he said theres room for two sets of quadrilles in the chief saloon if the rest keep their legs well up on the sofas
But theres only ten or a dozen in the party this time
More than that rather get in one anothers way especially with so many ladies on board
Theron asked no more questions but bent his head to see the last of this wonderful craft
The sight of it and what he had heard about it suddenly gave point and focus to his thoughts
He knew at last what it was that had lurked formless and undesignated these many days in the background of his dreams
The picture rose in his mind now of Celia as the mistress of a yacht
He could see her reclining in a low easychair upon the polished deck with the big white sails billowing behind her and the sun shining upon the deep blue waves and glistening through the splash of spray in the air and weaving a halo of glowing gold about her fair head
Ah how the tender visions crowded now upon him
Eternal summer basked round this enchanted yacht of his fancy summer sought now in Scottish firths or Norwegian fiords now in quaint old Southern harbors ablaze with the hues of strange costumes and halftropical flowers and fruits now in faraway Oriental bays and lagoons or among the coral reefs and palmtrees of the luxurious Pacific
He dwelt upon these new imaginings with the fervent longing of an inlandborn boy
Every vague yearning he had ever felt toward saltwater stirred again in his blood at the thought of the seawith Celia
Why not
She had never visited any foreign land
Sometime she had said sometime no doubt I will
He could hear again the wistful musing tone of her voice
The thought had fascinations for her it was clear
How irresistibly would it not appeal to her presented with the added charm of a roving vagrant independence on the high seas free to speed in her snowwinged chariot wherever she willed over the deep loitering in this place or uphelmandaway to another with no more care or weight of responsibility than the gulls tossing through the air in her wake
Theron felt rather than phrased to himself that there would not be ten or a dozen in the party on that yacht
Without defining anything in his mind he breathed in fancy the same bold ocean breeze which filled the sails and toyed with Celias hair he looked with her as she sat by the rail and saw the same waves racing past the same vast dome of cloud and ether that were mirrored in her brown eyes and there was no one else anywhere near them
Even the men in sailors clothes who would be pulling at ropes or climbing up tarred ladders kept themselves considerately outside the picture
Only Celia sat there and at her feet gazing up again into her face as in the forest the man whose whole being had been consecrated to her service her worship by the kiss
Youve passed it now
I was trying to point out the Jumel house to youwhere Aaron Burr lived you know
Theron roused himself from his daydream and nodded with a confused smile at his neighbor
Thanks he faltered I didnt hear you
The train makes such a noise and I must have been dozing
He looked about him
The night aspect as of a tramps lodginghouse had quite disappeared from the car
Everybody was sitting up and the more impatient were beginning to collect their bundles and handbags from the racks and floor
An expressman came through jangling a huge bunch of brass checks on leathern thongs over his arm and held parley with passengers along the aisle
Outside citified streets with stores and factories were alternating in the moving panorama with open fields and even as he looked these vacant spaces ceased altogether and successive regular lines of pavement between two tall rows of houses all alike began to stretch out wheel to the right and swing off out of view for all the world like the avenues of hoppoles he remembered as a boy
Then was a long tunnel its darkness broken at stated intervals by brief bursts of daylight from overhead and out of this all at once the train drew up its full length in some vast vaguely lighted enclosure and stopped
Yes this is New York said the man folding up his paper and springing to his feet
The narrow aisle was filled with many others who had been prompter still and Theron stood bag in hand waiting till this energetic throng should have pushed itself bodily past him forth from the car
Then he himself made his way out drifting with a sense of helplessness in their resolute wake
There rose in his mind the sudden conviction that he would be too late
All the passengers in the forward sleepers would be gone before he could get there
Yet even this terror gave him no new power to get ahead of anybody else in the tightly packed throng
Once on the broad platform the others started off briskly they all seemed to know just where they wanted to go and to feel that no instant of time was to be lost in getting there
Theron himself caught some of this urgent spirit and hurled himself along in the throng with reckless haste knocking his bag against peoples legs but never pausing for apology or comment until he found himself abreast of the locomotive at the head of the train
He drew aside from the main current here and began searching the platform far and near for those he had travelled so far to find
The platform emptied itself
Theron lingered on in puzzled hesitation and looked about him
In the whole immense station with its acres of tracks and footways and its incessantly shifting processions of people there was visible nobody else who seemed also in doubt or who appeared capable of sympathizing with indecision in any form
Another train came in some way over to the right and before it had fairly stopped swarms of eager men began boiling out of each end of each car literally precipitating themselves over one another it seemed to Theron in their excited dash down the steps
As they caught their footing below they started racing pellmell down the platform to its end there he saw them looking more than ever like clustered bees in the distance struggling vehemently in a dense mass up a staircase in the remote corner of the building
What are those folks running for
Is there a fire
he asked an amiablefaced young mulatto in the uniform of the sleepingcar service who passed him with some light handbags
No theys Harlem people I guessjes catchin the Elevated thats all sir he answered obligingly
At the moment some passengers emerged slowly from one of the sleepingcars and came loitering toward him
Why are there people still in these cars
he asked eagerly
Havent they all gone
Some has some aint the porter replied
They most generally take their time about it
They aint no hurry so longs they get out fore were drawn round to the drillyard
There was still hope then
Theron took up his bag and walked forward intent upon finding some place from which he could watch unobserved the belated stragglers issuing from the sleepingcars
He started back all at once confronted by a semicircle of violent men with whips and badges who stunned his hearing by a sudden vociferous outburst of shouts and yells
They made furious gestures at him with their whips and fists to enforce the incoherent babel of their voices and in these gestures as in their faces and cries there seemed a great deal of menace and very little invitation
There was a big policeman sauntering near by and Theron got the idea that it was his presence alone which protected him from open violence at the hands of these savage hackmen
He tightened his clutch on his valise and turning his back on them and their uproar tried to brave it out and stand where he was
But the policeman came lounging slowly toward him with such authority in his swaying gait and such urban omniscience written all over his broad sandy face that he lost heart and beat an abrupt retreat off to the right where there were a number of doorways near which other people had ventured to put down baggage on the floor
Here somewhat screened from observation he stood for a long time watching at odd moments the ceaselessly varying phases of the strange scene about him but always keeping an eye on the train he had himself arrived in
It was slow and dispiriting work
A dozen times his heart failed him and he said to himself mournfully that he had had his journey for nothing
Then some new figure would appear alighting from the steps of a sleeper and hope revived in his breast
At last when over half an hour of expectancy had been marked off by the big clock overhead his suspense came to an end
He saw Father Forbes erect and substantial form standing on the car platform nearest of all balancing himself with his white hands on the rails waiting for something
Then after a little he came down followed by a black porter whose arms were burdened by numerous bags and parcels
The two stood a minute or so more in hesitation at the side of the steps
Then Celia descended and the three advanced
The importance of not being discovered was uppermost in Therons mind now that he saw them actually coming toward him
He had avoided this the previous evening in the Octavius depot with some skill he flattered himself
It gave him a pleasurable sense of being a man of affairs almost a detective to be confronted by the necessity now of baffling observation once again
He was still rather without plans for keeping them in view once they left the station
He had supposed that he would be able to hear what hotel they directed their driver to take them to and failing that he had fostered a notion based upon a story he had read when a boy of throwing himself into another carriage and bidding his driver to pursue them in hot haste and on his life not fail to track them down
These devices seemed somewhat empty now that the urgent moment was at hand and as he drew back behind some other loiterers out of view he sharply racked his wits for some way of coping with this most pressing problem
It turned out however that there was no difficulty at all
Father Forbes and Celia seemed to have no use for the hackmen but moved straight forward toward the street through the doorway next to that in which Theron cowered
He stole round and followed them at a safe distance making Celias hat and the portmanteau perched on the shoulder of the porter behind her his guides
To his surprise they still kept on their course when they had reached the sidewalk and went over the pavement across an open square which spread itself directly in front of the station
Hanging as far behind as he dared he saw them pass to the other sidewalk diagonally opposite proceed for a block or so along this and then separate at a corner
Celia and the negro lad went down a side street and entered the door of a vast tall redbrick building which occupied the whole block
The priest turning on his heel came back again and went boldly up the broad steps of the front entrance to this same structure which Theron now discovered to be the Murray Hill Hotel
Fortune had indeed favored him
He not only knew where they were but he had been himself a witness to the furtive way in which they entered the house by different doors
Nothing in his own limited experience of hotels helped him to comprehend the notion of a separate entrance for ladies and their luggage
He did not feel quite sure about the significance of what he had observed in his own mind
But it was apparent to him that there was something underhanded about it
After lingering awhile on the steps of the hotel and satisfying himself by peeps through the glass doors that the coast was clear he ventured inside
The great corridor contained many people coming going or standing about but none of them paid any attention to him
At last he made up his mind and beckoned a colored boy to him from a group gathered in the shadows of the big central staircase
Explaining that he did not at that moment wish a room but desired to leave his bag the boy took him to a cloakroom and got him a check for the thing
With this in his pocket he felt himself more at his ease and turned to walk away
Then suddenly he wheeled and bending his body over the counter of the cloakroom astonished the attendant inside by the eagerness with which he scrutinized the piled rows of portmanteaus trunks overcoats and bundles in the little enclosure
What is it you want
Heres your bag if youre looking for that this man said to him
No thanks its nothing replied Theron straightening himself again
He had had a narrow escape
Father Forbes and Celia walking side by side had come down the small passage in which he stood and had passed him so closely that he had felt her dress brush against him
Fortunately he had seen them in time and by throwing himself half into the cloakroom had rendered recognition impossible
He walked now in the direction they had taken till he came to the polite colored man at an open door on the left who was bowing people into the breakfast room
Standing in the doorway he looked about him till his eye lighted upon his two friends seated at a small table by a distant window with a black waiter card in hand bending over in consultation with them
Returning to the corridor he made bold now to march up to the desk and examine the register
The priests name was not there
He found only the brief entry Miss Madden Octavius written not by her but by Father Forbes
On the line were two numbers in pencil with an and between them
An indirect question to one of the clerks helped him to an explanation of this
When there were two numbers it meant that the guest in question had a parlor as well as a bedroom
Here he drew a long satisfied breath and turned away
The first half of his quest stood completedand that much more fully and easily than he had dared to hope
He could not but feel a certain new respect for himself as a man of resource and energy
He had demonstrated that people could not fool with him with impunity
It remained to decide what he would do with his discovery now that it had been so satisfactorily made
As yet he had given this hardly a thought
Even now it did not thrust itself forward as a thing demanding instant attention
It was much more important first of all to get a good breakfast
He had learned that there was another and less formal eatingplace downstairs in the basement by the bar with an entrance from the street
He walked down by the inner stairway instead feeling himself already at home in the big hotel
He ordered an ample breakfast and came out while it was being served to wash and have his boots blacked and he gave the man a quarter of a dollar
His pockets were filled with silver quarters halfdollars and dollars almost to a burdensome point and in his valise was a bag full of smaller change including many rolls of copper cents which Alice always counted and packed up on Mondays
In the hurry of leaving he had brought with him the church collections for the past two weeks
It occurred to him that he must keep a strict account of his expenditure
Meanwhile he gave ten cents to another man in a silksleeved cardigan jacket who had merely stood by and looked at him while his boots were being polished
There was a sense of metropolitan affluence in the very atmosphere
The little table in the adjoining room on which Theron found his meal in waiting for him seemed a vision of delicate napery and refined appointments in his eyes
He was wolfishly hungry and the dishes he looked upon gave him back assurances by sight and smell that he was very happy as well
The servant in attendance had an extremely white apron and a kindly black face
He bowed when Theron looked at him with the air of a lifelong admirer and humble friend
I suppose youll have claret with your breakfast sir
he remarked as if it were a matter of course
Why certainly answered Theron stretching his legs contentedly under the table and tucking the corner of his napkin in his neckbandCertainly my good man
CHAPTER XXX At ten oclock Theron loitering near the bookstall in the corridor saw Father Forbes come downstairs pass out through the big front doors get into a carriage and drive away
This relieved him of a certain sense of responsibility and he retired to a corner sofa and sat down
The detective side of him being off duty so to speak there was leisure at last for reflection upon the other aspects of his mission
Yes it was high time for him to consider what he should do next
It was easier to recognize this fact however than to act upon it
His mind was full of tricksy devices for eluding this task of serious thought which he sought to impose upon it
It seemed so much pleasanter not to think at all but just to drift
He found himself watching with envy the men who as they came out from their breakfast walked over to the bookstall and bought cigars from the row of boxes nestling there among the newspaper piles
They had such evident delight in the work of selection they took off the ends of the cigars so carefully and lighted them with such meditative attention he could see that he was wofully handicapped by not knowing how to smoke
He had had the most wonderful breakfast of his life but even in the consciousness of comfortable repletion which pervaded his being there was an obstinate sense of something lacking
No doubt a good cigar was the thing needed to round out the perfection of such a breakfast
He half rose once fired by a sudden resolution to go over and get one
But of course that was nonsense it would only make him sick
He sat down and determinedly set himself to thinking
The effort finally brought fruitand of a kind which gave him a very unhappy quarter of an hour
The lover part of him was uppermost now insistently exposing all its raw surfaces to the stings and scalds of jealousy
Up to this moment his brain had always evaded the direct question of how he and the priest relatively stood in Celias estimation
It forced itself remorselessly upon him now and his thoughts so far from shirking the subject seemed to rise up to meet it
It was extremely unpleasant all this
But then a calmer view asserted itself
Why go out of his way to invent anguish for himself
The relations between Celia and the priest whatever they might be were certainly of old standing
They had begun before his time
His own romance was a more recent affair and must take its place of course subject to existing conditions
It was all right for him to come to New York and satisfy his legitimate curiosity as to the exact character and scope of these conditions
But it was foolish to pretend to be amazed or dismayed at the discovery of their existence
They were a part of the situation which he with his eyes wide open had accepted
It was his function to triumph over them to supplant them to rear the edifice of his own victorious passion upon their ruins
It was to this that Celias kiss had invited him
It was for this that he had come to New York
To let his purpose be hampered or thwarted now by childish doubts and jealousies would be ridiculous
He rose and holding himself very erect walked with measured deliberation across the corridor and up the broad staircase
There was an elevator near at hand he had noticed but he preferred the stairs
One or two of the colored boys clustered about the foot of the stairs looked at him and he had a moment of dreadful apprehension lest they should stop his progress
Nothing was said and he went on
The numbers on the first floor were not what he wanted and after some wandering about he ascended to the next and then to the third
Every now and then he encountered attendants but intuitively he bore himself with an air of knowing what he was about which protected him from inquiry
Finally he came upon the hallway he sought
Passing along he found the doors bearing the numbers he had memorized so well
They were quite close together and there was nothing to help him guess which belonged to the parlor
He hesitated gazing wistfully from one to the other
In the instant of indecision even while his alert ear caught the sound of feet coming along toward the passage in which he stood a thought came to quicken his resolve
It became apparent to him that his discovery gave him a certain new measure of freedom with Celia a sort of right to take things more for granted than heretofore
He chose a door at random and rapped distinctly on the panel
Come
The voice he knew for Celias
The single word however recalled the usage of Father Forbes which he had noted more than once at the pastorate when Maggie had knocked
He straightened his shoulders took his hat off and pushed open the door
It WAS the parlora room of sofas pianos big easychairs and luxurious bricabrac
A tall woman was walking up and down in it with bowed head
Her back was at the moment toward him and he looked at her saying to himself that this was the lady of his dreams the enchantress of the kiss the woman who loved him but somehow it did not seem to his senses to be Celia
She turned and moved a step or two in his direction before she mechanically lifted her eyes and saw who was standing in her doorway
She stopped short and regarded him
Her face was in the shadow and he could make out nothing of its expression save that there was a general effect of gravity about it
I cannot receive you she said
You must go away
You have no business to come like this without sending up your card
Theron smiled at her
The notion of taking in earnest her inhospitable words did not at all occur to him
He could see now that her face had vexed and saddened lines upon it and the sharpness of her tone remained in his ears
But he smiled again gently to reassure her
I ought to have sent up my name I know he said but I couldnt bear to wait
I just saw your name on the register andyou WILL forgive me wont you I ran to you at once
I know you wont have the heart to send me away
She stood where she had halted her arms behind her looking him fixedly in the face
He had made a movement to advance and offer his hand in greeting but her posture checked the impulse
His courage began to falter under her inspection
Must I really go down again
he pleaded
Its a crushing penalty to suffer for such little indiscretion
I was so excited to find you were hereI never stopped to think
Dont send me away please dont
Celia raised her head
Well shut the door then she said since you are so anxious to stay
You would have done much better though very much better indeed to have taken the hint and gone away
Will you shake hands with me Celia
he asked softly as he came near her
Sit there please
she made answer indicating a chair in the middle of the room
He obeyed her but to his surprise instead of seating herself as well she began walking up and down the length of the floor again
After a turn or two she stopped in front of him and looked him full in the eye
The light from the windows was on her countenance now and its revelations vaguely troubled him
It was a Celia he had never seen before who confronted him
I am much occupied by other matters she said speaking with cold impassivity but still I find myself curious to know just what limits you set to your dishonesty
Theron stared up at her
His lips quivered but no speech came to them
If this was all merely fond playfulness it was being carried to a heartaching point
I saw you hiding about in the depot at home last evening she went on
You come up here pretending to have discovered me by accident but I saw you following me from the Grand Central this morning
Yes I did both these things said Theron boldly
A fine bravery tingled in his veins all at once
He looked into her face and found the spirit to disregard its frowning aspect
Yes I did them he repeated defiantly
That is not the hundredth part or the thousandth part of what I would do for your sake
I have got way beyond caring for any consequences
Position reputation the good opinion of fools what are they
Life itselfwhat does it amount to
Nothing at allwith you in the balance
Yesbut I am not in the balance observed Celia quietly
That is where you have made your mistake
Theron laid aside his hat
Women were curious creatures he reflected
Some were susceptible to one line of treatment some to another
His own reading of Celia had always been that she liked opposition of a smart rattling almost cheeky sort
One got on best with her by saying bright things
He searched his brain now for some clever quip that would strike sparks from the adamantine mood which for the moment it was her whim to assume
To cover the process he smiled a little
Then her beauty as she stood before him her queenly form clad in a more stiffly fashionable dress than he had seen her wearing before appealed afresh and overwhelmingly to him
He rose to his feet
Have you forgotten our talk in the woods
he murmured with a wooing note
Have you forgotten the kiss
She shook her head calmly
I have forgotten nothing
Then why play with me so cruelly now
he went on in a voice of tender deprecation
I know you dont mean it but all the same it bruises my heart a little
I build myself so wholly upon you I have made existence itself depend so completely upon your smile upon a soft glance in your eyes that when they are not there why I suffer I dont know how to live at all
So be kinder to me Celia
I was kinder as you call it when you came in she replied
I told you to go away
That was pure kindness more kindness than you deserved
Theron looked at his hat where it stood on the carpet by his feet
He felt tears coming into his eyes
You tell me that you remember he said in depressed tones and yet you treat me like this
Perhaps I am wrong
No doubt it is my own fault
I suppose I ought not to have come down here at all
Celia nodded her head in assent to this view
But I swear that I was helpless in the matter he burst forth
I HAD to come
It would have been literally impossible for me to have stayed at home knowing that you were here and knowing also thatthat Go on
said Celia thrusting forth her underlip a trifle and hardening still further the gleam in her eye as he stumbled over his sentence and left it unfinished
What was the other thing that you were knowing
Knowing he took up the word hesitatinglyknowing that life would be insupportable to me if I could not be near you
She curled her lip at him
You skated over the thin spot very well she commented
It was on the tip of your tongue to mention the fact that Father Forbes came with me
Oh I can read you through and through Mr
Ware
In a misty way Theron felt things slipping from his grasp
The rising moisture blurred his eyes as their gaze clung to Celia
Then if you do read me he protested you must know how utterly my heart and brain are filled with you
No other man in all the world can yield himself so absolutely to the woman he worships as I can
You have taken possession of me so wholly I am not in the least master of myself any more
I dont know what I say or what I do
I am not worthy of you I know
No man alive could be that
But no one else will idolize and reverence you as I do
Believe me when I say that Celia
And how can you blame me in your heart for following you
Whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou diest will I die and there will I be buried
The Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death part thee and me
Celia shrugged her shoulders and moved a few steps away from him
Something like despair seized upon him
Surely he urged with passion surely I have a right to remind you of the kiss
She turned
The kiss she said meditatively
Yes you have a right to remind me of it
Oh yes an undoubted right
You have another right toothe right to have the kiss explained to you
It was of the goodbye order
It signified that we werent to meet again and that just for one little moment I permitted myself to be sorry for you
That was all
He held himself erect under the incredible words and gazed blankly at her
The magnitude of what he confronted bewildered him his mind was incapable of taking it in
You mean he started to say and then stopped helplessly staring into her face with a dropped jaw
It was too much to try to think what she meant
A little sidethought sprouted in the confusion of his brain
It grew until it spread a bitter smile over his pale face
I know so little about kisses he said I am such a greenhorn at that sort of thing
You should have had pity on my inexperience and told me just what brand of kiss it was I was getting
Probably I ought to have been able to distinguish but you see I was brought up in the countryon a farm
They dont have kisses in assorted varieties there
She bowed her head slightly
Yes you are entitled to say that she assented
I was to blame and it is quite fair that you should tell me so
You spoke of your inexperience your innocence
That was why I kissed you in saying goodbye
It was in memory of that innocence of yours to which you yourself had been busy saying goodbye ever since I first saw you
The idea seemed to me to mean something at the moment
I see now that it was too subtle
I do not usually err on that side
Theron kept his hold upon her gaze as if it afforded him bodily support
He felt that he ought to stoop and take up his hat but he dared not look away from her
Do you not err now on the side of cruelty
he asked her piteously
It seemed for the instant as if she were wavering and he swiftly thrust forth other pleas
I admit that I did wrong to follow you to New York
I see that now
But it was an offence committed in entire good faith
Think of it Celia
I have never seen you since that day that day in the woods
I have waitedand waited with no sign from you no chance of seeing you at all
Think what that meant to me
Everything in the world had been altered for me torn up by the roots
I was a new being plunged into a new existence
The kiss had done that
But until saw you again I could not tell whether this vast change in me and my life was for good or for bad whether the kiss had come to me as a blessing or a curse
The suspense was killing me Celia
That is why when I learned that you were coming here I threw everything to the winds and followed you
You blame me for it and I bow my head and accept the blame
But are you justified in punishing me so terribly in going on after I have confessed my error and cutting my heart into little strips putting me to death by torture
Sit down said Celia with a softened weariness in her voice
She seated herself in front of him as he sank into his chair again
I dont want to give you unnecessary pain but you have insisted on forcing yourself into a position where there isnt anything else but pain
I warned you to go away but you wouldnt
No matter how gently I may try to explain things to you you are bound to get nothing but suffering out of the explanation
Now shall I still go on
He inclined his head in token of assent and did not lift it again but raised toward her a disconsolate gaze from a pallid drooping face
It is all in a single word Mr Ware she proceeded in low tones
I speak for others as well as myself mind youwe find that you are a bore
Therons stiffened countenance remained immovable
He continued to stare unblinkingly up into her eyes
We were disposed to like you very much when we first knew you Celia went on
You impressed us as an innocent simple genuine young character full of mothers milk
It was like the smell of early spring in the country to come in contact with you
Your honesty of nature your sincerity in that absurd religion of yours your general NAIVETE of mental and spiritual getup all pleased us a great deal
We thought you were going to be a real acquisition
Just a momentwhom do you mean by we
He asked the question calmly enough but in a voice with an effect of distance in it
It may not be necessary to enter into that she replied
Let me go on
But then it became apparent little by little that we had misjudged you
We liked you as I have said because you were unsophisticated and delightfully fresh and natural
Somehow we took it for granted you would stay so
Rut that is just what you didnt dojust what you hadnt the sense to try to do
Instead we found you inflating yourself with all sorts of egotisms and vanities
We found you presuming upon the friendships which had been mistakenly extended to you
Do you want instances
You went to Dr Ledsmars house that very day after I had been with you to get a piano at Thurstons and tried to inveigle him into talking scandal about me
You came to me with tales about him
You went to Father Forbes and sought to get him to gossip about us both
Neither of those men will ever ask you inside his house again
But that is only one part of it
Your whole mind became an unpleasant thing to contemplate
You thought it would amuse and impress us to hear you ridiculing and reviling the people of your church whose money supports you and making a mock of the things they believe in and which you for your life wouldnt dare let them know you didnt believe in
You talked to us slightingly about your wife
What were you thinking of not to comprehend that that would disgust us
You showed me oncedo you remembera life of George Sand that you had just boughtbought because you had just discovered that she had an unclean side to her life
You chuckled as you spoke to me about it and you were for all the world like a little nasty boy giggling over something dirty that older people had learned not to notice
These are merely random incidents
They are just samples picked haphazard of the things in you which have been opening our eyes little by little to our mistake
I can understand that all the while you really fancied that you were expanding growing in all directions
What you took to be improvement was degeneration
When you thought that you were impressing us most by your smart sayings and doings you were reminding us most of the fable about the donkey trying to play lapdog
And it wasnt even an honest straightforward donkey at that
She uttered these last words sorrowfully her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes sinking to the floor
A silence ensued
Then Theron reached a groping hand out for his hat and rising walked with a lifeless automatic step to the door
He had it half open when the impossibility of leaving in this way towered suddenly in his path and overwhelmed him
He slammed the door to and turned as if he had been whirled round by some mighty wind
He came toward her with something almost menacing in the vigor of his movements and in the wild look upon his white set face
Halting before her he covered the tailorclad figure the coiled red hair the upturned face with its simulated calm the big brown eyes the rings upon the clasped fingers with a sweeping comprehensive glare of passion
This is what you have done to me then
His voice was unrecognizable in his own ears hoarse and broken but with a frightcompelling something in it which stimulated his rage
The horrible notion of killing her there where she sat spread over the chaos of his mind with an effect of unearthly light red and abnormally evil
It was like that first devilish radiance ushering in Creation of which the firstfruit was Cain
Why should he not kill her
In all ages women had been slain for less
Yesand men had been hanged
Something rose and stuck in his dry throat and as he swallowed it down the sinister flare of murderous fascination died suddenly away into darkness
The world was all black againplunged in the Egyptian night which lay upon the face of the deep while the earth was yet without form and void
He was alone on it alone among awful planetary solitudes which crushed him
The sight of Celia sitting motionless only a pace in front of him was plain enough to his eyes
It was an illusion
She was really a star many millions of miles away
These things were hard to understand but they were true none the less
People seemed to be about him but in fact he was alone
He recalled that even the little child in the car playing with those two buttons on a string would have nothing to do with him
Take his money yes take all he would give herbut not smile at him not come within reach of him
Men closed the doors of their houses against him
The universe held him at arms length as a nuisance
He was standing with one knee upon a sofa
Unconsciously he had moved round to the side of Celia and as he caught the effect of her face now in profile memorypictures began at once building themselves in his brainpictures of her standing in the darkened room of the cottage of death declaiming the CONFITEOR of her seated at the piano under the pure mellowed candlelight of her leaning her chin on her hands and gazing meditatively at the leafy background of the woods they were in of her lying back indolently content in the deckchair on the yacht of his fancythat yacht which a few hours before had seemed so brilliantly and bewitchingly real to him and nownow
He sank in a heap upon the couch and burying his face among its cushions wept and groaned aloud
His collapse was absolute
He sobbed with the abandonment of one who in the veritable presence of death lets go all sense of relation to life
Presently some one was touching him on the shoulder an incisive pointed touchand he checked himself and lifted his face
You will have to get up and present some sort of an appearance and go away at once Celia said to him in low rapid tones
Some gentlemen are at the door whom I have been waiting for
As he stupidly sat up and tried to collect his faculties Celia had opened the door and admitted two visitors
The foremost was Father Forbes and he with some whispered smiling words presented to her his companion a tall robust florid man of middleage with a frockcoat and a gray mustache sharply waxed
The three spoke for a moment together
Then the priests wandering eye suddenly lighted upon the figure on the sofa
He stared knitted his brows and then lifted them in inquiry as he turned to Celia
Poor man
she said readily in tones loud enough to reach Theron
It is our neighbor Father the Rev
Mr Ware
He hit upon my name in the register quite unexpectedly and I had him come up
He is in sore distress a great and sudden bereavement
He is going now
Wont you speak to him in the halla few words Father
It would please him
He is terribly depressed
The words had drawn Theron to his feet as by some mechanical process
He took up his hat and moved dumbly to the door
It seemed to him that Celia intended offering to shake hands but he went past her with only some confused exchange of glances and a murmured word or two
The tall stranger who drew aside to let him pass had acted as if he expected to be introduced
Theron emerging into the hall leaned against the wall and looked dreamily at the priest who had stepped out with him
I am very sorry to learn that you are in trouble Mr Ware Father Forbes said gently enough but in hurried tones
Miss Madden is also in trouble
I mentioned to you that her brother had got into a serious scrape
I have brought my old friend General Brady to consult with her about the matter
He knows all the parties concerned and he can set things right if anybody can
Its a mistake about meI m not in any trouble at all said Theron
I just dropped in to make a friendly call
The priest glanced sharply at him noting with a swift informed scrutiny how he sprawled against the wall and what vacuity his eyes and loosened lips expressed
Then you have a talent for the inopportune amounting to positive genius said Father Forbes with a stormy smile
Tell me this Father Forbes the other demanded with impulsive suddenness is it true that you dont want me in your house again
Is that the truth or not
The truth is always relative Mr Ware replied the priest turning away and closing the door of the parlor behind him with a decisive sound
Left alone Theron started to make his way downstairs
He found his legs wavering under him and making zigzag movements of their own in a bewildering fashion
He referred this at first in an outburst of fresh despair to the effects of his great grief
Then as he held tight to the banister and governed his descent step by step it occurred to him that it must be the wine he had had for breakfast
Upon examination he was not so unhappy after all
CHAPTER XXXI At the second peal of the doorbell Brother Soulsby sat up in bed
It was still pitchdark and the memory of the first ringing fluttered musically in his awakening consciousness as a part of some dream he had been having
Who the deuce can that be
he mused aloud in querulous resentment at the interruption
Put your head out of the window and ask suggested his wife drowsily
The bellpull scraped violently in its socket and a third outburst of shrill reverberations clamored through the silent house
Whatever you do Id do it before he yanked the whole thing to pieces added the wife with more decision
Brother Soulsby was wide awake now
He sprang to the floor and groping about in the obscurity began drawing on some of his clothes
He rapped on the window during the process to show that the house was astir and a minute afterward made his way out of the room and down the stairs the boards creaking under his stockinged feet as he went
Nearly a quarter of an hour passed before he returned
Sister Soulsby lying in sleepy quiescence heard vague sounds of voices at the front door and did not feel interested enough to lift her head and listen
A noise of footsteps on the sidewalk followed first receding from the door then turning toward it this second time marking the presence of more than one person
There seemed in this the implication of a guest and she shook off the dozing impulses which enveloped her faculties and waited to hear more
There came up after further muttering of male voices the undeniable chink of coins striking against one another
Then more footsteps the resonant slam of a carriage door out in the street the grinding of wheels turning on the frosty road and the racket of a vehicle and horses going off at a smart pace into the night
Somebody had come then
She yawned at the thought but remained well awake tracing idly in her mind as various slight sounds rose from the lower floor the different things Soulsby was probably doing
Their spare room was down there directly underneath but curiously enough no one seemed to enter it
The faint murmur of conversation which from time to time reached her came from the parlor instead
At last she heard her husbands soft tread coming up the staircase and still there had been no hint of employing the guestchamber
What could he be about
she wondered
Brother Soulsby came in bearing a small lamp in his hand the reddish light of which flaring upward revealed an unlookedfor display of amusement on his thin beardless face
He advanced to the bedside shading the glare from her blinking eyes with his palm and grinned
A thousand guesses old lady he said with a dry chuckle and you wouldnt have a ghost of a chance
You might guess till Hades froze over seven feet thick and still you wouldnt hit it
She sat up in turn
Good gracious man she began you dont mean Here the cheerful gleam in his small eyes reassured her and she sighed relief then smiled confusedly
I half thought just for the minute she explained it might be some bounder whod come East to try and blackmail me
But no who is itand what on earth have you done with him
Brother Soulsby cackled in merriment
Its Brother Ware of Octavius out on a little bat all by himself
He says hes been on the loose only two days but it looks more like a fortnight
OUR Brother Ware
she regarded him with openeyed surprise
Well yes I suppose hes OUR Brother Waresome returned Soulsby genially
He seems to think so anyway
But tell me about it
she urged eagerly
Whats the matter with him
How does he explain it
Well he explains it pretty badly if you ask me said Soulsby with a droll joking eye and a mockserious voice
He seated himself on the side of the bed facing her and still considerately shielding her from the light of the lamp he held
But dont think I suggested any explanations
Ive been a mother myself
Hes merely filled himself up to the neck with rum in the simple ordinary good oldfashioned way
Thats all
What is there to explain about that
She looked meditatively at him for a time shaking her head
No Soulsby she said gravely at last
This isnt any laughing matter
You may be sure something bad has happened to set him off like that
Im going to get up and dress right now
What time is it
Now dont you do anything of the sort he urged persuasively
It isnt five oclock itll be dark for nearly an hour yet
Just you turn over and have another nap
Hes all right
I put him on the sofa with the buffalo robe round him
Youll find him there safe and sound when its time for white folks to get up
You know how it breaks you up all day not to get your full sleep
I dont care if it makes me look as old as the everlasting hills she said
Cant you understand Soulsby
The thing worries megets on my nerves
I couldnt close an eye if I tried
I took a great fancy to that young man
I told you so at the time
Soulsby nodded and turned down the wick of his lamp a trifle
Yes I know you did he remarked in placidly noncontentious tones
I cant say I saw much in him myself but I daresay youre right
There followed a moments silence during which he experimented in turning the wick up again
But anyway he went on there isnt anything you can do
Hell sleep it off and the longer hes left alone the better
It isnt as if we had a hired girl whod come down and find him there and give the whole thing away
Hes fixed up there perfectly comfortable and when hes had his sleep out and wakes up on his own account hell be feeling a heap better
The argument might have carried conviction but on the instant the sound of footsteps came to them from the room below
The subdued noise rose regularly as of one pacing to and fro
No Soulsby YOU come back to bed and get YOUR sleep out
Im going downstairs
Its no good talking Im going
Brother Soulsby offered no further opposition either by talk or demeanor but returned contentedly to bed pulling the comforter over his ears and falling into the slow measured respiration of tranquil slumber before his wife was ready to leave the room
The dim cold gray of twilight was sifting furtively through the lace curtains of the front windows when Mrs Soulsby lamp in hand entered the parlor
She confronted a figure she would have hardly recognized
The man seemed to have been submerged in a bath of disgrace
From the crown of his head to the soles of his feet everything about him was altered distorted smeared with an intangible effect of shame
In the vague gloom of the middle distance between lamp and window she noticed that his shoulders were crouched like those of some shambling tramp
The frowsy shadows of a stubble beard lay on his jaw and throat
His clothes were crumpled and hung awry his boots were stained with mud
The silk hat on the piano told its battered story with dumb eloquence
Lifting the lamp she moved forward a step and threw its light upon his face
A little groan sounded involuntarily upon her lips
Out of a mask of unpleasant features swollen with drink and weighted by the physical craving for rest and sleep there stared at her two bloodshot eyes shining with the wild light of hysteria
The effect of dishevelled hair relaxed muscles and rough halfbearded lower face lent to these eyes as she caught their first glance an unnatural glare
The lamp shook in her hand for an instant
Then ashamed of herself she held out her other hand fearlessly to him
Tell me all about it Theron she said calmly and with a soothing motherly intonation in her voice
He did not take the hand she offered but suddenly with a wailing moan cast himself on his knees at her feet
He was so tall a man that the movement could have no grace
He abased his head awkwardly to bury it among the folds of the skirts at her ankles
She stood still for a moment looking down upon him
Then blowing out the light she reached over and set the smoking lamp on the piano near by
The daylight made things distinguishable in a wan uncertain way throughout the room
I have come out of hell for the sake of hearing some human being speak to me like that
The thick utterance proceeded in a muffled fashion from where his face grovelled against her dress
Its despairing accents appealed to her but even more was she touched by the ungainly figure he made sprawling on the carpet
Well since you are out stay out she answered as reassuringly as she could
But get up and take a seat here beside me like a sensible man and tell me all about it
Come
I insist
In obedience to her tone and the sharp tug at his shoulder with which she emphasized it he got slowly to his feet and listlessly seated himself on the sofa to which she pointed
He hung his head and began catching his breath with a periodical gasp half hiccough half sob
First of all she said in her brisk matteroffact manner dont you want to lie down there again and have me tuck you up snug with the buffalo robe and go to sleep
That would be the best thing you could do
He shook his head disconsolately from side to side
I cant
he groaned with a swifter recurrence of the soblike convulsions
Im dying for sleep but Im too too frightened
Come Ill sit beside you till you drop off she said with masterful decision
He suffered himself to be pushed into recumbency on the couch and put his head with docility on the pillow she brought from the spare room
When she had spread the fur over him and pushed her chair close to the sofa she stood by it for a little looking down in meditation at his demoralized face
Under the painful surfaceblur of wretchedness and fatigued debauchery she traced reflectively the lineaments of the younger and cleanlier countenance she had seen a few months before
Nothing essential had been taken away
There was only this pestiferous overlaying of shame and cowardice to be removed
The face underneath was still all right
With a soft maternal touch she smoothed the hair from his forehead into order
Then she seated herself and when he got his hand out from under the robe and thrust it forth timidly she took it in hers and held it in a warm sympathetic grasp
He closed his eyes at this and gradually the paroxysmal catch in his breathing lapsed
The daylight strengthened until at last tiny flecks of sunshine twinkled in the meshes of the further curtains at the window
She fancied him asleep and gently sought to disengage her hand but his fingers clutched at it with vehemence and his eyes were wide open
I cant sleep at all he murmured
I want to talk
There s nothing in the world to hinder you she commented smilingly
I tell you the solemn truth he said lifting his voice in dogged assertion the best sermon I ever preached in my life I preached only three weeks ago at the campmeeting
It was admitted by everybody to be far and away my finest effort
They will tell you the same
Its quite likely assented Sister Soulsby
I quite believe it
Then how can anybody say that Ive degenerated that Ive become a fool
he demanded
I havent heard anybody hint at such a thing she answered quietly
No of course YOU havent heard them
he cried
I heard them though
Then forcing himself to a sitting posture against the restraint of her hand he flung back the covering
Im burning hot already
Yes those were the identical words I havent improved Ive degenerated
People hate me they wont have me in their houses
They say Im a nuisance and a bore
Im like a little nasty boy
Thats what they say
Even a young man who was dyinglying right on the edge of his open gravetold me solemnly that I reminded him of a saint once but I was only fit for a barkeeper now
They say I really dont know anything at all
And Im not only a fool they say Im a dishonest fool into the bargain
But who says such twaddle as that
she returned consolingly
The violence of his emotion disturbed her
You mustnt imagine such things
You are among friends here
Other people are your friends too
They have the very highest opinion of you
I havent a friend on earth but you
he declared solemnly
His eyes glowed fiercely and his voice sank into a grave intensity of tone
I was going to kill myself
I went on to the big bridge to throw myself off and a policeman saw me trying to climb over the railing and he grabbed me and marched me away
Then he threw me out at the entrance and said he would club my head off if I came there again
And then I went and stood and let the cablecars pass close by me and twenty times I thought I had the nerve to throw myself under the next one and then I waited for the next and I was afraid
And then I was in a crowd somewhere and the warning came to me that I was going to die
The fool neednt go kill himself God would take care of that
It was my heart you know
Ive had that terrible fluttering once before
It seized me this time and I fell down in the crowd and some people walked over me but some one else helped me up and let me sit down in a big lighted hallway the entrance to some theatre and some one brought me some brandy but somebody else said I was drunk and they took it away again and put me out
They could see I was a fool that I hadnt a friend on earth
And when I went out there was a big picture of a woman in tights and the word Amazons overhead and then I remembered you
I knew you were my friend the only one I have on earth
It is very flatteringto be remembered like that said Sister Soulsby gently
The disposition to laugh was smothered by a pained perception of the suffering he was undergoing
His face had grown drawn and haggard under the burden of his memories as he rambled on
So I came straight to you he began again
I had just money enough left to pay my fare
The rest is in my valise at the hotelthe Murray Hill Hotel
It belongs to the church
I stole it from the church
When I am dead they can get it back again
Sister Soulsby forced a smile to her lips
What nonsense you talkabout dying
she exclaimed
Why man alive youll sleep this all off like a top if youll only lie down and give yourself a chance
Come now you must do as youre told
With a resolute hand she made him lie down again and once more covered him with the fur
He submitted and did not even offer to put out his arm this time but looked in piteous dumbness at her for a long time
While she sat thus in silence the sound of Brother Soulsby moving about upstairs became audible
Theron heard it and the importance of hurrying on some further disclosure seemed to suggest itself
I can see you think Im just drunk he said in low sombre tones
Of course thats what HE thought
The hackman thought so and so did the conductor and everybody
But I hoped you would know better
I was sure you would see that it was something worse than that
See here Ill tell you
Then youll understand
Ive been drinking for two days and one whole night on my feet all the while wandering alone in that big strange New York going through places where they murdered men for ten cents mixing myself up with the worst people in low barrooms and dancehouses and they saw I had money in my pocket too and yet nobody touched me or offered to lay a finger on me
Do you know why
They understood that I wanted to get drunk and couldnt
The Indians wont harm an idiot or lunatic you know
Well it was the same with these vilest of the vile
They saw that I was a fool whom God had taken hold of to break his heart first and then to craze his brain and then to fling him on a dunghill to die like a dog
They believe in God those people
Theyre the only ones who do it seems to me
And they wouldnt interfere when they saw what He was doing to me
But I tell you I wasnt drunk
I havent been drunk
Im only heartbroken and crushed out of shape and lifethats all
And Ive crawled here just to have a friend by me whenwhen I come to the end
Youre not talking very sensibly or very bravely either Theron Ware remarked his companion
Its cowardly to give way to notions like that
Oh I m not afraid to die dont think that he remonstrated wearily
If there is a Judgment it has hit me as hard as it can already
There cant be any hell worse than that Ive gone through
Here I am talking about hell he continued with a pained contraction of the muscles about his mouth a stillborn malformed smileas if I believed in one
Ive got way through all my beliefs you know
I tell you that frankly
Its none of my business she reassured him
Im not your Bishop or your confessor
Im just your friend your pal thats all
Look here
he broke in with some animation and a new intensity of glance and voice
If I was going to live Id have some funny things to tell
Six months ago I was a good man
I not only seemed to be good to others and to myself but I was good
I had a soul I had a conscience
I was going along doing my duty and I was happy in it
We were poor Alice and I and people behaved rather hard toward us and sometimes we were a little down in the mouth about it but that was all
We really were happy and II really was a good man
Heres the kind of joke God plays
You see me here six months after
Look at me
I havent got an honest hair in my head
Im a bad man through and through thats what I am
I look all around at myself and there isnt an atom left anywhere of the good man I used to be
And mind you I never lifted a finger to prevent the change
I didnt resist once I didnt make any fight
I just walked deliberately downhill with my eyes wide open
I told myself all the while that I was climbing uphill instead but I knew in my heart that it was a lie
Everything about me was a lie
I wouldnt be telling the truth even now ifif I hadnt come to the end of my rope
Now how do you explain that
How can it be explained
Was I really rotten to the core all the time years ago when I seemed to everybody myself and the rest to be good and straight and sincere
Was it all a sham or does God take a good man and turn him into an outandout bad one in just a few monthsin the time that it takes an ear of corn to form and ripen and go off with the mildew
Or isnt there any God at allbut only men who live and die like animals
And that would explain my case wouldnt it
I got bitten and went vicious and crazy and theyve had to chase me out and hunt me to my death like a mad dog
Yes that makes it all very simple
It isnt worth while to discuss me at all as if I had a soul is it
Im just one more mongrel cur thats gone mad and must be put out of the way
Thats all
See here said Sister Soulsby alertly I half believe that a good cuffing is what you really stand in need of
Now you stop all this nonsense and lie quiet and keep still
Do you hear me
The jocose sternness which she assumed in words and manner seemed to soothe him
He almost smiled up at her in a melancholy way and sighed profoundly
Ive told you MY religion before she went on with gentleness
The sheep and the goats are to be separated on Judgment Day but not a minute sooner
In other words as long as human life lasts good bad and indifferent are all braided up together in every mans nature and every womans too
You werent altogether good a year ago any more than youre altogether bad now
You were some of both then youre some of both now
If youve been making an extra sort of fool of yourself lately why now that you recognize it the only thing to do is to slow steam pull up and back engine in the other direction
In that way youll find things will even themselves up
Its a seesaw with all of us Theron Waresometimes up sometimes down
But nobody is rotten clear to the core
He closed his eyes and lay in silence for a time
This is what day of the week
he asked at last
Friday the nineteenth
Wednesdaythat would be the seventeenth
That was the day ordained for my slaughter
On that morning I was the happiest man in the world
No king could have been so proud and confident as I was
A wonderful romance had come to me
The most beautiful young woman in the world the most talented too was waiting for me
An express train was carrying me to her and it couldnt go fast enough to keep up with my eagerness
She was very rich and she loved me and we were to live in eternal summer wherever we liked on a big beautiful yacht
No one else had such a life before him as that
It seemed almost too good for me but I thought I had grown and developed so much that perhaps I would be worthy of it
Oh how happy I was
I tell you this becausebecause YOU are not like the others
You will understand
Yes I understand she said patiently
Wellyou were being so happy
That was in the morningWednesday the seventeenth early in the morning
There was a little girl in the car playing with some buttons and when I tried to make friends with her she looked at me and she saw right at a glance that I was a fool
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you know
She was the first to find it out
It began like that early in the morning
But then after that everybody knew it
They had only to look at me and they said Why this is a foollike a little nasty boy we wont let him into our houses we find him a bore
That is what they said
Did SHE say it
Sister Soulsby permitted herself to ask
For answer Theron bit his lips and drew his chin under the fur and pushed his scowling face into the pillow
The spasmodic soblike gasps began to shake him again
She laid a compassionate hand upon his hot brow
That is why I made my way here to you he groaned piteously
I knew you would sympathize I could tell it all to you
And it was so awful to die there alone in the strange city I couldnt do itwith nobody near me who liked me or thought well of me
Alice would hate me
There was no one but you
I wanted to be with you at the last
His quavering voice broke off in a gust of weeping and his face frankly surrendered itself to the distortions of a crying childs countenance widemouthed and tragically grotesque in its abandonment of control
Sister Soulsby as her husbands boots were heard descending the stairs rose and drew the robe up to half cover his agonized visage
She patted the sufferer softly on the head and then went to the stairdoor
I think hell go to sleep now she said lifting her voice to the newcomer and with a backward nod toward the couch
Come out into the kitchen while I get breakfast or into the sittingroom or somewhere so as not to disturb him
Hes promised me to lie perfectly quiet and try to sleep
When they had passed together out of the room she turned
Soulsby she said with halfplayful asperity Im disappointed in you
For a man whos knocked about as much as you have I must say youve picked up an astonishingly small outfit of gumption
That poor creature in there is no more drunk than I am
Hes been drinkingyes drinking like a fish but it wasnt able to make him drunk
Hes past being drunk hes griefcrazy
Its a case of woman
Some girl has made a fool of him and decoyed him up in a balloon and let him drop
Hes been hurt bad too
We have all been hurt in our day and generation responded Brother Soulsby genially
Dont you worry hell sleep that off too
It takes longer than drink and it doesnt begin to be so pleasant but it can be slept off
Take my word for it hell be a different man by noon
When noon came however Brother Soulsby was on his way to summon one of the village doctors
Toward nightfall he went out again to telegraph for Alice
CHAPTER XXXII Spring fell early upon the pleasant southern slopes of the Susquehanna country
The snow went off as by magic
The trees budded and leaved before their time
The birds came and set up their chorus in the elms while winter seemed still a thing of yesterday
Alice clad gravely in black stood again upon a kitchenstoop and looked across an intervening space of backyards and fences to where the tall boughs fresh in their new verdure were silhouetted against the pure blue sky
The prospect recalled to her irresistibly another sunlit morning a year ago when she had stood in the doorway of her own kitchen and surveyed a scene not unlike this it might have been with the same carolling robins the same trees the same azure segment of the tranquil speckless dome
Then she was looking out upon surroundings novel and strange to her among which she must make herself at home as best she could
But at least the ground was secure under her feet at least she had a home and a word from her lips could summon her husband out to stand beside her with his arm about her and share her buoyant hopeful joy in the promises of spring
To think that that was only one little year agothe mere revolution of four brief seasons
And now
Sister Soulsby wiping her hands on her apron came briskly out upon the stoop
Some cheerful commonplace was on her tongue but a glance at Alices wistful face kept it back
She passed an arm around her waist instead and stood in silence looking at the elms
It brings back memories to meall this said Alice nodding her head and not seeking to dissemble the tears which sprang to her eyes
The men will be down in a minute dear the other reminded her
Theyd nearly finished packing before I put the biscuits in the oven
We mustnt wear long faces before folks you know
Yes I know murmured Alice
Then with a sudden impulse she turned to her companion
Candace she said fervently were alone here for the moment I must tell you that if I dont talk gratitude to you its simply and solely because I dont know where to begin or what to say
Im just dumfounded at your goodness
It takes my speech away
I only know this Candace God will be very good to you
Tut
tut
replied Sister Soulsby thats all right you dear thing
I know just how you feel
Dont dream of being under obligation to explain it to me or to thank us at all
Weve had all sorts of comfort out of the thing Soulsby and I
We used to get downright lonesome here all by ourselves and weve simply had a winter of pleasant company instead that s all
Besides theres solid satisfaction in knowing that at last for once in our lives weve had a chance to be of some real use to somebody who truly needed it
You cant imagine how stuck up that makes us in our own conceit
We feel as if we were George Peabody and Lady BurdettCoutts and several other philanthropists thrown in
No seriously dont think of it again
Were glad to have been able to do it all and if you only go ahead now and prosper and be happy why that will be the only reward we want
I hope we shall do well said Alice
Only tell me this Candace
You do think I was right dont you in insisting on Therons leaving the ministry altogether
He seems convinced enough now that it was the right thing to do but I grow nervous sometimes lest he should find it harder than he thought to get along in business and regret the changeand blame me
I think you may rest easy in your mind about that the other responded
Whatever else he does he will never want to come within gunshot of a pulpit again
It came too near murdering him for that
Alice looked at her doubtfully
Something came near murdering him I know
But it doesnt seem to me that I would say it was the ministry
And I guess you know pretty well yourself what it was
Of course Ive never asked any questions and Ive hushed up everybody at Octavius who tried to quiz me about it his disappearance and my packing up and leaving and all that and Ive never discussed the question with youbut No and theres no good going into it now put in Sister Soulsby with amiable decisiveness
Its all past and gone
In fact I hardly remember much about it now myself
He simply got into deep water poor soul and weve floated him out again safe and sound
Thats all
But all the same I was right in what I said
He was a mistake in the ministry
But if youd known him in previous years urged Alice plaintively before we were sent to that awful Octavius
He was the very ideal of all a young minister should be
People used to simply worship him he was such a perfect preacher and so pureminded and friendly with everybody and threw himself into his work so
It was all that miserable contemptible Octavius that did the mischief
Sister Soulsby slowly shook her head
If there hadnt been a screw loose somewhere she said gently Octavius wouldnt have hurt him
No take my word for it he never was the right man for the place
He seemed to be no doubt but he wasnt
When pressure was put on him it found out his weak spot like a shot and pushed on it andwell it came near smashing him thats all
And do you think hell always be aa backslider mourned Alice
For mercys sake dont ever try to have him pretend to be anything else
exclaimed the other
The last state of that man would be worse than the first
You must make up your mind to that
And you mustnt show that youre nervous about it
You mustnt get nervous
You mustnt be afraid of things
Just you keep a stiff upper lip and say you WILL get along you WILL be happy
Thats your only chance Alice
He isnt going to be an angel of light or a saint or anything of that sort and its no good expecting it
But hell be just an average kind of mana little sore about some things a little wiser than he was about some others
You can get along perfectly with him if you only keep your courage up and dont show the white feather
Yes I know but Ive had it pretty well taken out of me commented Alice
It used to come easy to me to be cheerful and resolute and all that but its different now
Sister Soulsby stole a swift glance at the unsuspecting face of her companion which was not all admiration but her voice remained patiently affectionate
Oh thatll all come back to you right enough
Youll have your hands full you know finding a house and unpacking all your old furniture and buying new things and getting your home settled
Itll keep you so busy you wont have time to feel strange or lonesome one bit
Youll see how itll tone you up
In a years time you wont know yourself in the lookingglass
Oh my health is good enough said Alice but I cant help thinking suppose Theron should be taken sick again away out there among strangers
You know hes never appeared to me to have quite got his strength back
These long illnesses you know they always leave a mark on a man
Nonsense
Hes strong as an ox insisted Sister Soulsby
You mark my word hell thrive in Seattle like a green baytree
Seattle
echoed Alice meditatively
It sounds like the other end of the world doesnt it
The noise of feet in the house broke upon the colloquy and the women went indoors to join the breakfast party
During the meal it was Brother Soulsby who bore the burden of the conversation
He was full of the future of Seattle and the magnificent impending development of that Pacific section
He had been out there years ago when it was next door to uninhabited
He had visited the district twice since and the changes discoverable each new time were more wonderful than anything Aladdins lamp ever wrought
He had secured for Theron through some of his friends in Portland the superintendency of a land and real estate company which had its headquarters in Seattle but ambitiously linked its affairs with the future of all Washington Territory
In an hours time the hack would come to take the Wares and their baggage to the depot the first stage in their long journey across the continent to their new home
Brother Soulsby amiably filled the interval with reminiscences of the Oregon of twenty years back with instructive dissertations upon the soil climate and seasons of Puget Sound and the Columbia valley and above all with helpful characterizations of the social life which had begun to take form in this remotest West
He had nothing but confidence to all appearances in the success of his young friend now embarking on this new career
He seemed so sanguine about it that the whole atmosphere of the breakfast room lightened up and the parting meal surrounded by so many temptations to distraught broodings and silences as it was became almost jovial in its spirit
At last it was time to look for the carriage
The trunks and handbags were ready in the hall and Sister Soulsby was tying up a package of sandwiches for Alice to keep by her in the train
Theron with hat in hand and overcoat on arm loitered restlessly into the kitchen and watched this proceeding for a moment
Then he sauntered out upon the stoop and lifting his head and drawing as long a breath as he could looked over at the elms
Perhaps the face was older and graver it was hard to tell
The long winters illness with its recurring crises and sustained confinement had bleached his skin and reduced his figure to gauntness but there was none the less an air of restored and secure good health about him
Only in the eyes themselves as they rested briefly upon the prospect did a substantial change suggest itself
They did not dwell fondly upon the picture of the lofty spreading boughs with their waves of sapgreen leafage stirring against the blue
They did not soften and glow this time at the thought of how wholly one felt sure of Gods goodness in these wonderful new mornings of spring
They looked instead straight through the fairest and most moving spectacle in natures processional and saw afar off in conjectural vision a formless sort of place which was Seattle
They surveyed its impalpable outlines its undefined dimensions with a certain cool glitter of hardandfast resolve
There rose before his fancy out of the chaos of these shapeless imaginings some faces of men then more behind them then a great concourse of uplifted countenances crowded close together as far as the eye could reach
They were attentive faces all rapt eager credulous to a degree
Their eyes were admiringly bent upon a common object of excited interest
They were looking at HIM they strained their ears to miss no cadence of his voice
Involuntarily he straightened himself stretched forth his hand with the pale thin fingers gracefully disposed and passed it slowly before him from side to side in a comprehensive stately gesture
The audience rose at him as he dropped his hand and filled his daydream with a mighty roar of applause in volume like an ocean tempest yet pitched for his hearing alone
He smiled shook himself with a little delighted tremor and turned on the stoop to the open door
What Soulsby said about politics out there interested me enormously he remarked to the two women
I shouldnt be surprised if I found myself doing something in that line
I can speak you know if I cant do anything else
Talk is what tells these days
Who knows
I may turn up in Washington a fullblown senator before Im forty
Stranger things have happened than that out West
Well come down and visit you then Soulsby and I said Sister Soulsby cheerfully
You shall take us to the White House Alice and introduce us
Oh it isnt likely I would come East said Alice pensively
Most probably Id be left to amuse myself in Seattle
But thereI think thats the carriage driving up to the door
