407 ANNE of the ISLAND by Lucy Maud Montgomery Chapter I The Shadow of Change Harvest is ended and summer is gone quoted Anne Shirley gazing across the shorn fields dreamily
She and Diana Barry had been picking apples in the Green Gables orchard but were now resting from their labors in a sunny corner where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by on the wings of a wind that was still summersweet with the incense of ferns in the Haunted Wood
But everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn
The sea was roaring hollowly in the distance the fields were bare and sere scarfed with golden rod the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple and the Lake of Shining Waters was blue  blue  blue not the changeful blue of spring nor the pale azure of summer but a clear steadfast serene blue as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams
It has been a nice summer said Diana twisting the new ring on her left hand with a smile
And Miss Lavendars wedding seemed to come as a sort of crown to it
I suppose Mr and Mrs Irving are on the Pacific coast now
It seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the world sighed Anne
I cant believe it is only a week since they were married
Everything has changed
Miss Lavendar and Mr and Mrs Allan gone  how lonely the manse looks with the shutters all closed
I went past it last night and it made me feel as if everybody in it had died
Well never get another minister as nice as Mr Allan said Diana with gloomy conviction
I suppose well have all kinds of supplies this winter and half the Sundays no preaching at all
And you and Gilbert gone  it will be awfully dull
Fred will be here insinuated Anne slyly
When is Mrs Lynde going to move up
asked Diana as if she had not heard Annes remark
Tomorrow
Im glad shes coming  but it will be another change
Marilla and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday
Do you know I hated to do it
Of course it was silly  but it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege
That old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me
When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world
You remember what a consuming desire I had to sleep in a spare room bed  but not the Green Gables spare room
Oh no never there
It would have been too terrible  I couldnt have slept a wink from awe
I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in on an errand  no indeed I tiptoed through it and held my breath as if I were in church and felt relieved when I got out of it
The pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there one on each side of the mirror and frowned so sternly at me all the time I was in especially if I dared peep in the mirror which was the only one in the house that didnt twist my face a little
I always wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room
And now its not only cleaned but stripped bare
George Whitefield and the Duke have been relegated to the upstairs hall
So passes the glory of this world  concluded Anne with a laugh in which there was a little note of regret
It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated even when we have outgrown them
Ill be so lonesome when you go moaned Diana for the hundredth time
And to think you go next week
But were together still said Anne cheerily
We mustnt let next week rob us of this weeks joy
I hate the thought of going myself  home and I are such good friends
Talk of being lonesome
Its I who should groan
YOULL be here with any number of your old friends  AND Fred
While I shall be alone among strangers not knowing a soul
EXCEPT Gilbert  AND Charlie Sloane said Diana imitating Annes italics and slyness
Charlie Sloane will be a great comfort of course agreed Anne sarcastically whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed
Diana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane but despite sundry confidential talks she did not know just what Anne thought of Gilbert Blythe
To be sure Anne herself did not know that
The boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport for all I know Anne went on
I am glad Im going to Redmond and I am sure I shall like it after a while
But for the first few weeks I know I wont
I shant even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend visit home as I had when I went to Queens
Christmas will seem like a thousand years away
Everything is changing  or going to change said Diana sadly
I have a feeling that things will never be the same again Anne
We have come to a parting of the ways I suppose said Anne thoughtfully
We had to come to it
Do you think Diana that being grownup is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we were children
I dont know  there are SOME nice things about it answered Diana again caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the effect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced
But there are so many puzzling things too
Sometimes I feel as if being grownup just frightened me  and then I would give anything to be a little girl again
I suppose well get used to being grownup in time said Anne cheerfully
There wont be so many unexpected things about it by and by  though after all I fancy its the unexpected things that give spice to life
Were eighteen Diana
In two more years well be twenty
When I was ten I thought twenty was a green old age
In no time youll be a staid middleaged matron and I shall be nice old maid Aunt Anne coming to visit you on vacations
Youll always keep a corner for me wont you Di darling
Not the spare room of course  old maids cant aspire to spare rooms and I shall be as umble as Uriah Heep and quite content with a little overtheporch or offtheparlor cubby hole
What nonsense you do talk Anne laughed Diana
Youll marry somebody splendid and handsome and rich  and no spare room in Avonlea will be half gorgeous enough for you  and youll turn up your nose at all the friends of your youth
That would be a pity my nose is quite nice but I fear turning it up would spoil it said Anne patting that shapely organ
I havent so many good features that I could afford to spoil those I have so even if I should marry the King of the Cannibal Islands I promise you I wont turn up my nose at you Diana
With another gay laugh the girls separated Diana to return to Orchard Slope Anne to walk to the Post Office
She found a letter awaiting her there and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her on the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it
Priscilla Grant is going to Redmond too she exclaimed
Isnt that splendid
I hoped she would but she didnt think her father would consent
He has however and were to board together
I feel that I can face an army with banners  or all the professors of Redmond in one fell phalanx  with a chum like Priscilla by my side
I think well like Kingsport said Gilbert
Its a nice old burg they tell me and has the finest natural park in the world
Ive heard that the scenery in it is magnificent
I wonder if it will be  can be  any more beautiful than this murmured Anne looking around her with the loving enraptured eyes of those to whom home must always be the loveliest spot in the world no matter what fairer lands may lie under alien stars
They were leaning on the bridge of the old pond drinking deep of the enchantment of the dusk just at the spot where Anne had climbed from her sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot
The fine empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies but the moon was rising and the water lay like a great silver dream in her light
Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures
You are very quiet Anne said Gilbert at last
Im afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will vanish just like a broken silence breathed Anne
Gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the rail of the bridge
His hazel eyes deepened into darkness his still boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled his soul
But Anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly
The spell of the dusk was broken for her
I must go home she exclaimed with a rather overdone carelessness
Marilla had a headache this afternoon and Im sure the twins will be in some dreadful mischief by this time
I really shouldnt have stayed away so long
She chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached the Green Gables lane
Poor Gilbert hardly had a chance to get a word in edgewise
Anne felt rather relieved when they parted
There had been a new secret selfconsciousness in her heart with regard to Gilbert ever since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of Echo Lodge
Something alien had intruded into the old perfect schoolday comradeship  something that threatened to mar it
I never felt glad to see Gilbert go before she thought half resentfully halfsorrowfully as she walked alone up the lane
Our friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense
It mustnt be spoiled  I wont let it
Oh WHY cant boys be just sensible
Anne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly sensible that she should still feel on her hand the warm pressure of Gilberts as distinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had rested there and still less sensible that the sensation was far from being an unpleasant one  very different from that which had attended a similar demonstration on Charlie Sloanes part when she had been sitting out a dance with him at a White Sands party three nights before
Anne shivered over the disagreeable recollection
But all problems connected with infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the homely unsentimental atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an eightyearold boy was crying grievously on the sofa
What is the matter Davy
asked Anne taking him up in her arms
Where are Marilla and Dora
Marillas putting Dora to bed sobbed Davy and Im crying cause Dora fell down the outside cellar steps heels over head and scraped all the skin off her nose and   Oh well dont cry about it dear
Of course you are sorry for her but crying wont help her any
Shell be all right tomorrow
Crying never helps any one Davyboy and   I aint crying cause Dora fell down cellar said Davy cutting short Annes wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness
Im crying cause I wasnt there to see her fall
Im always missing some fun or other seems to me
Oh Davy
Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter
Would you call it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the steps and get hurt
She wasnt MUCH hurt said Davy defiantly
Course if shed been killed Id have been real sorry Anne
But the Keiths aint so easy killed
Theyre like the Blewetts I guess
Herb Blewett fell off the hayloft last Wednesday and rolled right down through the turnip chute into the box stall where they had a fearful wild cross horse and rolled right under his heels
And still he got out alive with only three bones broke
Mrs Lynde says there are some folks you cant kill with a meataxe
Is Mrs Lynde coming here tomorrow Anne
Yes Davy and I hope youll be always very nice and good to her
Ill be nice and good
But will she ever put me to bed at nights Anne
Perhaps
Why
Cause said Davy very decidedly if she does I wont say my prayers before her like I do before you Anne
Why not
Cause I dont think it would be nice to talk to God before strangers Anne
Dora can say hers to Mrs Lynde if she likes but I wont
Ill wait till shes gone and then say em
Wont that be all right Anne
Yes if you are sure you wont forget to say them Davyboy
Oh I wont forget you bet
I think saying my prayers is great fun
But it wont be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you
I wish youd stay home Anne
I dont see what you want to go away and leave us for
I dont exactly WANT to Davy but I feel I ought to go
If you dont want to go you neednt
Youre grown up
When Im grown up Im not going to do one single thing I dont want to do Anne
All your life Davy youll find yourself doing things you dont want to do
I wont said Davy flatly
Catch me
I have to do things I dont want to now cause you and Marillall send me to bed if I dont
But when I grow up you cant do that and therell be nobody to tell me not to do things
Wont I have the time
Say Anne Milty Boulter says his mother says youre going to college to see if you can catch a man
Are you Anne
I want to know
For a second Anne burned with resentment
Then she laughed reminding herself that Mrs Boulters crude vulgarity of thought and speech could not harm her
No Davy Im not
Im going to study and grow and learn about many things
What things
Shoes and ships and sealing wax And cabbages and kings quoted Anne
But if you DID want to catch a man how would you go about it
I want to know persisted Davy for whom the subject evidently possessed a certain fascination
Youd better ask Mrs Boulter said Anne thoughtlessly
I think its likely she knows more about the process than I do
I will the next time I see her said Davy gravely
Davy
If you do
cried Anne realizing her mistake
But you just told me to protested Davy aggrieved
Its time you went to bed decreed Anne by way of getting out of the scrape
After Davy had gone to bed Anne wandered down to Victoria Island and sat there alone curtained with finespun moonlit gloom while the water laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind
Anne had always loved that brook
Many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in days gone by
She forgot lovelorn youths and the cayenne speeches of malicious neighbors and all the problems of her girlish existence
In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of faery lands forlorn where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie with the evening star for pilot to the land of Hearts Desire
And she was richer in those dreams than in realities for things seen pass away but the things that are unseen are eternal
Chapter II Garlands of Autumn The following week sped swiftly crowded with innumerable last things as Anne called them
Goodbye calls had to be made and received being pleasant or otherwise according to whether callers and calledupon were heartily in sympathy with Annes hopes or thought she was too much puffedup over going to college and that it was their duty to take her down a peg or two
The AVIS
gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert one evening at the home of Josie Pye choosing that place partly because Mr Pyes house was large and convenient partly because it was strongly suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing to do with the affair if their offer of the house for the party was not accepted
It was a very pleasant little time for the Pye girls were gracious and said and did nothing to mar the harmony of the occasion  which was not according to their wont
Josie was unusually amiable  so much so that she even remarked condescendingly to Anne Your new dress is rather becoming to you Anne
Really you look ALMOST PRETTY in it
How kind of you to say so responded Anne with dancing eyes
Her sense of humor was developing and the speeches that would have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now
Josie suspected that Anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes but she contented herself with whispering to Gertie as they went downstairs that Anne Shirley would put on more airs than ever now that she was going to college  youd see
All the old crowd was there full of mirth and zest and youthful lightheartedness
Diana Barry rosy and dimpled shadowed by the faithful Fred Jane Andrews neat and sensible and plain Ruby Gillis looking her handsomest and brightest in a cream silk blouse with red geraniums in her golden hair Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane both trying to keep as near the elusive Anne as possible Carrie Sloane looking pale and melancholy because so it was reported her father would not allow Oliver Kimball to come near the place Moody Spurgeon MacPherson whose round face and objectionable ears were as round and objectionable as ever and Billy Andrews who sat in a corner all the evening chuckled when any one spoke to him and watched Anne Shirley with a grin of pleasure on his broad freckled countenance
Anne had known beforehand of the party but she had not known that she and Gilbert were as the founders of the Society to be presented with a very complimentary address and tokens of respect  in her case a volume of Shakespeares plays in Gilberts a fountain pen
She was so taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address read in Moody Spurgeons most solemn and ministerial tones that the tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes
She had worked hard and faithfully for the AVIS and it warmed the cockles of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely
And they were all so nice and friendly and jolly  even the Pye girls had their merits at that moment Anne loved all the world
She enjoyed the evening tremendously but the end of it rather spoiled all
Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah and Anne to punish him was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed the latter to walk home with her
She found however that revenge hurts nobody quite so much as the one who tries to inflict it
Gilbert walked airily off with Ruby Gillis and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as they loitered along in the still crisp autumn air
They were evidently having the best of good times while she was horribly bored by Charlie Sloane who talked unbrokenly on and never even by accident said one thing that was worth listening to
Anne gave an occasional absent yes or no and thought how beautiful Ruby had looked that night how very goggly Charlies eyes were in the moonlight  worse even than by daylight  and that the world somehow wasnt quite such a nice place as she had believed it to be earlier in the evening
Im just tired out  that is what is the matter with me she said when she thankfully found herself alone in her own room
And she honestly believed it was
But a certain little gush of joy as from some secret unknown spring bubbled up in her heart the next evening when she saw Gilbert striding down through the Haunted Wood and crossing the old log bridge with that firm quick step of his
So Gilbert was not going to spend this last evening with Ruby Gillis after all
You look tired Anne he said
I am tired and worse than that Im disgruntled
Im tired because Ive been packing my trunk and sewing all day
But Im disgruntled because six women have been here to say goodbye to me and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November morning
Spiteful old cats
was Gilberts elegant comment
Oh no they werent said Anne seriously
That is just the trouble
If they had been spiteful cats I wouldnt have minded them
But they are all nice kind motherly souls who like me and whom I like and that is why what they said or hinted had such undue weight with me
They let me see they thought I was crazy going to Redmond and trying to take a BA and ever since Ive been wondering if I am
Mrs Peter Sloane sighed and said she hoped my strength would hold out till I got through and at once I saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous prostration at the end of my third year Mrs Eben Wright said it must cost an awful lot to put in four years at Redmond and I felt all over me that it was unpardonable of me to squander Marillas money and my own on such a folly
Mrs Jasper Bell said she hoped I wouldnt let college spoil me as it did some people and I felt in my bones that the end of my four Redmond years would see me a most insufferable creature thinking I knew it all and looking down on everything and everybody in Avonlea Mrs Elisha Wright said she understood that Redmond girls especially those who belonged to Kingsport were dreadful dressy and stuckup and she guessed I wouldnt feel much at home among them and I saw myself a snubbed dowdy humiliated country girl shuffling through Redmonds classic halls in coppertoned boots
Anne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled
With her sensitive nature all disapproval had weight even the disapproval of those for whose opinions she had scant respect
For the time being life was savorless and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle
You surely dont care for what they said protested Gilbert
You know exactly how narrow their outlook on life is excellent creatures though they are
To do anything THEY have never done is anathema maranatha
You are the first Avonlea girl who has ever gone to college and you know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with moonstruck madness
Oh I know
But FEELING is so different from KNOWING
My common sense tells me all you can say but there are times when common sense has no power over me
Common nonsense takes possession of my soul
Really after Mrs Elisha went away I hardly had the heart to finish packing
Youre just tired Anne
Come forget it all and take a walk with me  a ramble back through the woods beyond the marsh
There should be something there I want to show you
Should be
Dont you know if it is there
No
I only know it should be from something I saw there in spring
Come on
Well pretend we are two children again and well go the way of the wind
They started gaily off
Anne remembering the unpleasantness of the preceding evening was very nice to Gilbert and Gilbert who was learning wisdom took care to be nothing save the schoolboy comrade again
Mrs Lynde and Marilla watched them from the kitchen window
Thatll be a match some day Mrs Lynde said approvingly
Marilla winced slightly
In her heart she hoped it would but it went against her grain to hear the matter spoken of in Mrs Lyndes gossipy matteroffact way
Theyre only children yet she said shortly
Mrs Lynde laughed goodnaturedly
Anne is eighteen I was married when I was that age
We old folks Marilla are too much given to thinking children never grow up thats what
Anne is a young woman and Gilberts a man and he worships the ground she walks on as any one can see
Hes a fine fellow and Anne cant do better
I hope she wont get any romantic nonsense into her head at Redmond
I dont approve of them coeducational places and never did thats what
I dont believe concluded Mrs Lynde solemnly that the students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt
They must study a little said Marilla with a smile
Precious little sniffed Mrs Rachel
However I think Anne will
She never was flirtatious
But she doesnt appreciate Gilbert at his full value thats what
Oh I know girls
Charlie Sloane is wild about her too but Id never advise her to marry a Sloane
The Sloanes are good honest respectable people of course
But when alls said and done theyre SLOANES
Marilla nodded
To an outsider the statement that Sloanes were Sloanes might not be very illuminating but she understood
Every village has such a family good honest respectable people they may be but SLOANES they are and must ever remain though they speak with the tongues of men and angels
Gilbert and Anne happily unconscious that their future was thus being settled by Mrs Rachel were sauntering through the shadows of the Haunted Wood
Beyond the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset radiance under a pale aerial sky of rose and blue
The distant spruce groves were burnished bronze and their long shadows barred the upland meadows
But around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels and in it there was the note of autumn
This wood really is haunted now  by old memories said Anne stooping to gather a spray of ferns bleached to waxen whiteness by frost
It seems to me that the little girls Diana and I used to be play here still and sit by the Dryads Bubble in the twilights trysting with the ghosts
Do you know I can never go up this path in the dusk without feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver
There was one especially horrifying phantom which we created  the ghost of the murdered child that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours
I confess that to this day I cannot help fancying its little furtive footsteps behind me when I come here after nightfall
Im not afraid of the White Lady or the headless man or the skeletons but I wish I had never imagined that babys ghost into existence
How angry Marilla and Mrs Barry were over that affair concluded Anne with reminiscent laughter
The woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas threaded with gossamers
Past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces and a maplefringed sunwarm valley they found the something Gilbert was looking for
Ah here it is he said with satisfaction
An apple tree  and away back here
exclaimed Anne delightedly
Yes a veritable applebearing apple tree too here in the very midst of pines and beeches a mile away from any orchard
I was here one day last spring and found it all white with blossom
So I resolved Id come again in the fall and see if it had been apples
See its loaded
They look good too  tawny as russets but with a dusky red cheek
Most wild seedlings are green and uninviting
I suppose it sprang years ago from some chancesown seed said Anne dreamily
And how it has grown and flourished and held its own here all alone among aliens the brave determined thing
Heres a fallen tree with a cushion of moss
Sit down Anne  it will serve for a woodland throne
Ill climb for some apples
They all grow high  the tree had to reach up to the sunlight
The apples proved to be delicious
Under the tawny skin was a white white flesh faintly veined with red and besides their own proper apple taste they had a certain wild delightful tang no orchardgrown apple ever possessed
The fatal apple of Eden couldnt have had a rarer flavor commented Anne
But its time we were going home
See it was twilight three minutes ago and now its moonlight
What a pity we couldnt have caught the moment of transformation
But such moments never are caught I suppose
Lets go back around the marsh and home by way of Lovers Lane
Do you feel as disgruntled now as when you started out Anne
Not I
Those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul
I feel that I shall love Redmond and have a splendid four years there
And after those four years  what
Oh theres another bend in the road at their end answered Anne lightly
Ive no idea what may be around it  I dont want to have
Its nicer not to know
Lovers Lane was a dear place that night still and mysteriously dim in the pale radiance of the moonlight
They loitered through it in a pleasant chummy silence neither caring to talk
If Gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and simple everything would be reflected Anne
Gilbert was looking at Anne as she walked along
In her light dress with her slender delicacy she made him think of a white iris
I wonder if I can ever make her care for me he thought with a pang of selfdestruct
Chapter III Greeting and Farewell Charlie Sloane Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley left Avonlea the following Monday morning
Anne had hoped for a fine day
Diana was to drive her to the station and they wanted this their last drive together for some time to be a pleasant one
But when Anne went to bed Sunday night the east wind was moaning around Green Gables with an ominous prophecy which was fulfilled in the morning
Anne awoke to find raindrops pattering against her window and shadowing the ponds gray surface with widening rings hills and sea were hidden in mist and the whole world seemed dim and dreary
Anne dressed in the cheerless gray dawn for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train she struggled against the tears that WOULD well up in her eyes in spite of herself
She was leaving the home that was so dear to her and something told her that she was leaving it forever save as a holiday refuge
Things would never be the same again coming back for vacations would not be living there
And oh how dear and beloved everything was  that little white porch room sacred to the dreams of girlhood the old Snow Queen at the window the brook in the hollow the Dryads Bubble the Haunted Woods and Lovers Lane  all the thousand and one dear spots where memories of the old years bided
Could she ever be really happy anywhere else
Breakfast at Green Gables that morning was a rather doleful meal
Davy for the first time in his life probably could not eat but blubbered shamelessly over his porridge
Nobody else seemed to have much appetite save Dora who tucked away her rations comfortably
Dora like the immortal and most prudent Charlotte who went on cutting bread and butter when her frenzied lovers body had been carried past on a shutter was one of those fortunate creatures who are seldom disturbed by anything
Even at eight it took a great deal to ruffle Doras placidity
She was sorry Anne was going away of course but was that any reason why she should fail to appreciate a poached egg on toast
Not at all
And seeing that Davy could not eat his Dora ate it for him
Promptly on time Diana appeared with horse and buggy her rosy face glowing above her raincoat
The goodbyes had to be said then somehow
Mrs Lynde came in from her quarters to give Anne a hearty embrace and warn her to be careful of her health whatever she did
Marilla brusque and tearless pecked Annes cheek and said she supposed theyd hear from her when she got settled
A casual observer might have concluded that Annes going mattered very little to her  unless said observer had happened to get a good look in her eyes
Dora kissed Anne primly and squeezed out two decorous little tears but Davy who had been crying on the back porch step ever since they rose from the table refused to say goodbye at all
When he saw Anne coming towards him he sprang to his feet bolted up the back stairs and hid in a clothes closet out of which he would not come
His muffled howls were the last sounds Anne heard as she left Green Gables
It rained heavily all the way to Bright River to which station they had to go since the branch line train from Carmody did not connect with the boat train
Charlie and Gilbert were on the station platform when they reached it and the train was whistling
Anne had just time to get her ticket and trunk check say a hurried farewell to Diana and hasten on board
She wished she were going back with Diana to Avonlea she knew she was going to die of homesickness
And oh if only that dismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping over summer vanished and joys departed
Even Gilberts presence brought her no comfort for Charlie Sloane was there too and Sloanishness could be tolerated only in fine weather
It was absolutely insufferable in rain
But when the boat steamed out of Charlottetown harbor things took a turn for the better
The rain ceased and the sun began to burst out goldenly now and again between the rents in the clouds burnishing the gray seas with copperhued radiance and lighting up the mists that curtained the Islands red shores with gleams of gold foretokening a fine day after all
Besides Charlie Sloane promptly became so seasick that he had to go below and Anne and Gilbert were left alone on deck
I am very glad that all the Sloanes get seasick as soon as they go on water thought Anne mercilessly
I am sure I couldnt take my farewell look at the ould sod with Charlie standing there pretending to look sentimentally at it too
Well were off remarked Gilbert unsentimentally
Yes I feel like Byrons Childe Harold  only it isnt really my native shore that Im watching said Anne winking her gray eyes vigorously
Nova Scotia is that I suppose
But ones native shore is the land one loves the best and thats good old PEI
for me
I cant believe I didnt always live here
Those eleven years before I came seem like a bad dream
Its seven years since I crossed on this boat  the evening Mrs Spencer brought me over from Hopetown
I can see myself in that dreadful old wincey dress and faded sailor hat exploring decks and cabins with enraptured curiosity
It was a fine evening and how those red Island shores did gleam in the sunshine
Now Im crossing the strait again
Oh Gilbert I do hope Ill like Redmond and Kingsport but Im sure I wont
Wheres all your philosophy gone Anne
Its all submerged under a great swamping wave of loneliness and homesickness
Ive longed for three years to go to Redmond  and now Im going  and I wish I werent
Never mind
I shall be cheerful and philosophical again after I have just one good cry
I MUST have that as a went  and Ill have to wait until I get into my boardinghouse bed tonight wherever it may be before I can have it
Then Anne will be herself again
I wonder if Davy has come out of the closet yet
It was nine that night when their train reached Kingsport and they found themselves in the bluewhite glare of the crowded station
Anne felt horribly bewildered but a moment later she was seized by Priscilla Grant who had come to Kingsport on Saturday
Here you are beloved
And I suppose youre as tired as I was when I got here Saturday night
Tired
Priscilla dont talk of it
Im tired and green and provincial and only about ten years old
For pitys sake take your poor brokendown chum to some place where she can hear herself think
Ill take you right up to our boardinghouse
Ive a cab ready outside
Its such a blessing youre here Prissy
If you werent I think I should just sit down on my suitcase here and now and weep bitter tears
What a comfort one familiar face is in a howling wilderness of strangers
Is that Gilbert Blythe over there Anne
How he has grown up this past year
He was only a schoolboy when I taught in Carmody
And of course thats Charlie Sloane
HE hasnt changed  couldnt
He looked just like that when he was born and hell look like that when hes eighty
This way dear
Well be home in twenty minutes
Home
groaned Anne
You mean well be in some horrible boardinghouse in a still more horrible hall bedroom looking out on a dingy back yard
It isnt a horrible boardinghouse Annegirl
Heres our cab
Hop in  the driver will get your trunk
Oh yes the boardinghouse  its really a very nice place of its kind as youll admit tomorrow morning when a good nights sleep has turned your blues rosy pink
Its a big oldfashioned gray stone house on St John Street just a nice little constitutional from Redmond
It used to be the residence of great folk but fashion has deserted St John Street and its houses only dream now of better days
Theyre so big that people living in them have to take boarders just to fill up
At least that is the reason our landladies are very anxious to impress on us
Theyre delicious Anne  our landladies I mean
How many are there
Two
Miss Hannah Harvey and Miss Ada Harvey
They were born twins about fifty years ago
I cant get away from twins it seems smiled Anne
Wherever I go they confront me
Oh theyre not twins now dear
After they reached the age of thirty they never were twins again
Miss Hannah has grown old not too gracefully and Miss Ada has stayed thirty less gracefully still
I dont know whether Miss Hannah can smile or not Ive never caught her at it so far but Miss Ada smiles all the time and thats worse
However theyre nice kind souls and they take two boarders every year because Miss Hannahs economical soul cannot bear to waste room space  not because they need to or have to as Miss Ada has told me seven times since Saturday night
As for our rooms I admit they are hall bedrooms and mine does look out on the back yard
Your room is a front one and looks out on Old St Johns graveyard which is just across the street
That sounds gruesome shivered Anne
I think Id rather have the back yard view
Oh no you wouldnt
Wait and see
Old St Johns is a darling place
Its been a graveyard so long that its ceased to be one and has become one of the sights of Kingsport
I was all through it yesterday for a pleasure exertion
Theres a big stone wall and a row of enormous trees all around it and rows of trees all through it and the queerest old tombstones with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions
Youll go there to study Anne see if you dont
Of course nobody is ever buried there now
But a few years ago they put up a beautiful monument to the memory of Nova Scotian soldiers who fell in the Crimean War
It is just opposite the entrance gates and theres scope for imagination in it as you used to say
Heres your trunk at last  and the boys coming to say good night
Must I really shake hands with Charlie Sloane Anne
His hands are always so cold and fishyfeeling
We must ask them to call occasionally
Miss Hannah gravely told me we could have young gentlemen callers two evenings in the week if they went away at a reasonable hour and Miss Ada asked me smiling please to be sure they didnt sit on her beautiful cushions
I promised to see to it but goodness knows where else they CAN sit unless they sit on the floor for there are cushions on EVERYTHING
Miss Ada even has an elaborate Battenburg one on top of the piano
Anne was laughing by this time
Priscillas gay chatter had the intended effect of cheering her up homesickness vanished for the time being and did not even return in full force when she finally found herself alone in her little bedroom
She went to her window and looked out
The street below was dim and quiet
Across it the moon was shining above the trees in Old St Johns just behind the great dark head of the lion on the monument
Anne wondered if it could have been only that morning that she had left Green Gables
She had the sense of a long passage of time which one day of change and travel gives
I suppose that very moon is looking down on Green Gables now she mused
But I wont think about it  that way homesickness lies
Im not even going to have my good cry
Ill put that off to a more convenient season and just now Ill go calmly and sensibly to bed and to sleep
Chapter IV Aprils Lady Kingsport is a quaint old town hearking back to early Colonial days and wrapped in its ancient atmosphere as some fine old dame in garments fashioned like those of her youth
Here and there it sprouts out into modernity but at heart it is still unspoiled it is full of curious relics and haloed by the romance of many legends of the past
Once it was a mere frontier station on the fringe of the wilderness and those were the days when Indians kept life from being monotonous to the settlers
Then it grew to be a bone of contention between the British and the French being occupied now by the one and now by the other emerging from each occupation with some fresh scar of battling nations branded on it
It has in its park a martello tower autographed all over by tourists a dismantled old French fort on the hills beyond the town and several antiquated cannon in its public squares
It has other historic spots also which may be hunted out by the curious and none is more quaint and delightful than Old St Johns Cemetery at the very core of the town with streets of quiet oldtime houses on two sides and busy bustling modern thoroughfares on the others
Every citizen of Kingsport feels a thrill of possessive pride in Old St Johns for if he be of any pretensions at all he has an ancestor buried there with a queer crooked slab at his head or else sprawling protectively over the grave on which all the main facts of his history are recorded
For the most part no great art or skill was lavished on those old tombstones
The larger number are of roughly chiselled brown or gray native stone and only in a few cases is there any attempt at ornamentation
Some are adorned with skull and crossbones and this grizzly decoration is frequently coupled with a cherubs head
Many are prostrate and in ruins
Into almost all Times tooth has been gnawing until some inscriptions have been completely effaced and others can only be deciphered with difficulty
The graveyard is very full and very bowery for it is surrounded and intersected by rows of elms and willows beneath whose shade the sleepers must lie very dreamlessly forever crooned to by the winds and leaves over them and quite undisturbed by the clamor of traffic just beyond
Anne took the first of many rambles in Old St Johns the next afternoon
She and Priscilla had gone to Redmond in the forenoon and registered as students after which there was nothing more to do that day
The girls gladly made their escape for it was not exhilarating to be surrounded by crowds of strangers most of whom had a rather alien appearance as if not quite sure where they belonged
The freshettes stood about in detached groups of two or three looking askance at each other the freshies wiser in their day and generation had banded themselves together on the big staircase of the entrance hall where they were shouting out glees with all the vigor of youthful lungs as a species of defiance to their traditional enemies the Sophomores a few of whom were prowling loftily about looking properly disdainful of the unlicked cubs on the stairs
Gilbert and Charlie were nowhere to be seen
Little did I think the day would ever come when Id be glad of the sight of a Sloane said Priscilla as they crossed the campus but Id welcome Charlies goggle eyes almost ecstatically
At least theyd be familiar eyes
Oh sighed Anne
I cant describe how I felt when I was standing there waiting my turn to be registered  as insignificant as the teeniest drop in a most enormous bucket
Its bad enough to feel insignificant but its unbearable to have it grained into your soul that you will never can never be anything but insignificant and that is how I did feel  as if I were invisible to the naked eye and some of those Sophs might step on me
I knew I would go down to my grave unwept unhonored and unsung
Wait till next year comforted Priscilla
Then well be able to look as bored and sophisticated as any Sophomore of them all
No doubt it is rather dreadful to feel insignificant but I think its better than to feel as big and awkward as I did  as if I were sprawled all over Redmond
Thats how I felt  I suppose because I was a good two inches taller than any one else in the crowd
I wasnt afraid a Soph might walk over me I was afraid theyd take me for an elephant or an overgrown sample of a potatofed Islander
I suppose the trouble is we cant forgive big Redmond for not being little Queens said Anne gathering about her the shreds of her old cheerful philosophy to cover her nakedness of spirit
When we left Queens we knew everybody and had a place of our own
I suppose we have been unconsciously expecting to take life up at Redmond just where we left off at Queens and now we feel as if the ground had slipped from under our feet
Im thankful that neither Mrs Lynde nor Mrs Elisha Wright know or ever will know my state of mind at present
They would exult in saying I told you so and be convinced it was the beginning of the end
Whereas it is just the end of the beginning
Exactly
That sounds more Anneish
In a little while well be acclimated and acquainted and all will be well
Anne did you notice the girl who stood alone just outside the door of the coeds dressing room all the morning  the pretty one with the brown eyes and crooked mouth
Yes I did
I noticed her particularly because she seemed the only creature there who LOOKED as lonely and friendless as I FELT
I had YOU but she had no one
I think she felt pretty allbyherselfish too
Several times I saw her make a motion as if to cross over to us but she never did it  too shy I suppose
I wished she would come
If I hadnt felt so much like the aforesaid elephant Id have gone to her
But I couldnt lumber across that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs
She was the prettiest freshette I saw today but probably favor is deceitful and even beauty is vain on your first day at Redmond concluded Priscilla with a laugh
Im going across to Old St Johns after lunch said Anne
I dont know that a graveyard is a very good place to go to get cheered up but it seems the only getatable place where there are trees and trees I must have
Ill sit on one of those old slabs and shut my eyes and imagine Im in the Avonlea woods
Anne did not do that however for she found enough of interest in Old St Johns to keep her eyes wide open
They went in by the entrance gates past the simple massive stone arch surmounted by the great lion of England
And on Inkerman yet the wild bramble is gory And those bleak heights henceforth shall be famous in story quoted Anne looking at it with a thrill
They found themselves in a dim cool green place where winds were fond of purring
Up and down the long grassy aisles they wandered reading the quaint voluminous epitaphs carved in an age that had more leisure than our own
Here lieth the body of Albert Crawford Esq read Anne from a worn gray slab for many years Keeper of His Majestys Ordnance at Kingsport
He served in the army till the peace of 1763 when he retired from bad health
He was a brave officer the best of husbands the best of fathers the best of friends
He died October 29th 1792 aged 84 years
Theres an epitaph for you Prissy
There is certainly some scope for imagination in it
How full such a life must have been of adventure
And as for his personal qualities Im sure human eulogy couldnt go further
I wonder if they told him he was all those best things while he was alive
Heres another said Priscilla
Listen  To the memory of Alexander Ross who died on the 22nd of September 1840 aged 43 years
This is raised as a tribute of affection by one whom he served so faithfully for 27 years that he was regarded as a friend deserving the fullest confidence and attachment
 A very good epitaph commented Anne thoughtfully
I wouldnt wish a better
We are all servants of some sort and if the fact that we are faithful can be truthfully inscribed on our tombstones nothing more need be added
Heres a sorrowful little gray stone Prissy  to the memory of a favorite child
And here is another erected to the memory of one who is buried elsewhere
I wonder where that unknown grave is
Really Pris the graveyards of today will never be as interesting as this
You were right  I shall come here often
I love it already
I see were not alone here  theres a girl down at the end of this avenue
Yes and I believe its the very girl we saw at Redmond this morning
Ive been watching her for five minutes
She has started to come up the avenue exactly half a dozen times and half a dozen times has she turned and gone back
Either shes dreadfully shy or she has got something on her conscience
Lets go and meet her
Its easier to get acquainted in a graveyard than at Redmond I believe
They walked down the long grassy arcade towards the stranger who was sitting on a gray slab under an enormous willow
She was certainly very pretty with a vivid irregular bewitching type of prettiness
There was a gloss as of brown nuts on her satinsmooth hair and a soft ripe glow on her round cheeks
Her eyes were big and brown and velvety under oddlypointed black brows and her crooked mouth was rosered
She wore a smart brown suit with two very modish little shoes peeping from beneath it and her hat of dull pink straw wreathed with goldenbrown poppies had the indefinable unmistakable air which pertains to the creation of an artist in millinery
Priscilla had a sudden stinging consciousness that her own hat had been trimmed by her village store milliner and Anne wondered uncomfortably if the blouse she had made herself and which Mrs Lynde had fitted looked VERY countrified and homemade besides the strangers smart attire
For a moment both girls felt like turning back
But they had already stopped and turned towards the gray slab
It was too late to retreat for the browneyed girl had evidently concluded that they were coming to speak to her
Instantly she sprang up and came forward with outstretched hand and a gay friendly smile in which there seemed not a shadow of either shyness or burdened conscience
Oh I want to know who you two girls are she exclaimed eagerly
Ive been DYING to know
I saw you at Redmond this morning
Say wasnt it AWFUL there
For the time I wished I had stayed home and got married
Anne and Priscilla both broke into unconstrained laughter at this unexpected conclusion
The browneyed girl laughed too
I really did
I COULD have you know
Come lets all sit down on this gravestone and get acquainted
It wont be hard
I know were going to adore each other  I knew it as soon as I saw you at Redmond this morning
I wanted so much to go right over and hug you both
Why didnt you
asked Priscilla
Because I simply couldnt make up my mind to do it
I never can make up my mind about anything myself  Im always afflicted with indecision
Just as soon as I decide to do something I feel in my bones that another course would be the correct one
Its a dreadful misfortune but I was born that way and there is no use in blaming me for it as some people do
So I couldnt make up my mind to go and speak to you much as I wanted to
We thought you were too shy said Anne
No no dear
Shyness isnt among the many failings  or virtues  of Philippa Gordon  Phil for short
Do call me Phil right off
Now what are your handles
Shes Priscilla Grant said Anne pointing
And SHES Anne Shirley said Priscilla pointing in turn
And were from the Island said both together
I hail from Bolingbroke Nova Scotia said Philippa
Bolingbroke
exclaimed Anne
Why that is where I was born
Do you really mean it
Why that makes you a Bluenose after all
No it doesnt retorted Anne
Wasnt it Dan OConnell who said that if a man was born in a stable it didnt make him a horse
Im Island to the core
Well Im glad you were born in Bolingbroke anyway
It makes us kind of neighbors doesnt it
And I like that because when I tell you secrets it wont be as if I were telling them to a stranger
I have to tell them
I cant keep secrets  its no use to try
Thats my worst failing  that and indecision as aforesaid
Would you believe it
 it took me half an hour to decide which hat to wear when I was coming here  HERE to a graveyard
At first I inclined to my brown one with the feather but as soon as I put it on I thought this pink one with the floppy brim would be more becoming
When I got IT pinned in place I liked the brown one better
At last I put them close together on the bed shut my eyes and jabbed with a hat pin
The pin speared the pink one so I put it on
It is becoming isnt it
Tell me what do you think of my looks
At this naive demand made in a perfectly serious tone Priscilla laughed again
But Anne said impulsively squeezing Philippas hand We thought this morning that you were the prettiest girl we saw at Redmond
Philippas crooked mouth flashed into a bewitching crooked smile over very white little teeth
I thought that myself was her next astounding statement but I wanted some one elses opinion to bolster mine up
I cant decide even on my own appearance
Just as soon as Ive decided that Im pretty I begin to feel miserably that Im not
Besides have a horrible old greataunt who is always saying to me with a mournful sigh You were such a pretty baby
Its strange how children change when they grow up
I adore aunts but I detest great aunts
Please tell me quite often that I am pretty if you dont mind
I feel so much more comfortable when I can believe Im pretty
And Ill be just as obliging to you if you want me to  I CAN be with a clear conscience
Thanks laughed Anne but Priscilla and I are so firmly convinced of our own good looks that we dont need any assurance about them so you neednt trouble
Oh youre laughing at me
I know you think Im abominably vain but Im not
There really isnt one spark of vanity in me
And Im never a bit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve them
Im so glad I know you folks
I came up on Saturday and Ive nearly died of homesickness ever since
Its a horrible feeling isnt it
In Bolingbroke Im an important personage and in Kingsport Im just nobody
There were times when I could feel my soul turning a delicate blue
Where do you hang out
Thirtyeight St Johns Street
Better and better
Why Im just around the corner on Wallace Street
I dont like my boardinghouse though
Its bleak and lonesome and my room looks out on such an unholy back yard
Its the ugliest place in the world
As for cats  well surely ALL the Kingsport cats cant congregate there at night but half of them must
I adore cats on hearth rugs snoozing before nice friendly fires but cats in back yards at midnight are totally different animals
The first night I was here I cried all night and so did the cats
You should have seen my nose in the morning
How I wished I had never left home
I dont know how you managed to make up your mind to come to Redmond at all if you are really such an undecided person said amused Priscilla
Bless your heart honey I didnt
It was father who wanted me to come here
His heart was set on it  why I dont know
It seems perfectly ridiculous to think of me studying for a BA
degree doesnt it
Not but what I can do it all right
I have heaps of brains
Oh
said Priscilla vaguely
Yes
But its such hard work to use them
And BA
s are such learned dignified wise solemn creatures  they must be
No I didnt want to come to Redmond
I did it just to oblige father
He IS such a duck
Besides I knew if I stayed home Id have to get married
Mother wanted that  wanted it decidedly
Mother has plenty of decision
But I really hated the thought of being married for a few years yet
I want to have heaps of fun before I settle down
And ridiculous as the idea of my being a BA
is the idea of my being an old married woman is still more absurd isnt it
Im only eighteen
No I concluded I would rather come to Redmond than be married
Besides how could I ever have made up my mind which man to marry
Were there so many
laughed Anne
Heaps
The boys like me awfully  they really do
But there were only two that mattered
The rest were all too young and too poor
I must marry a rich man you know
Why must you
Honey you couldnt imagine ME being a poor mans wife could you
I cant do a single useful thing and I am VERY extravagant
Oh no my husband must have heaps of money
So that narrowed them down to two
But I couldnt decide between two any easier than between two hundred
I knew perfectly well that whichever one I chose Id regret all my life that I hadnt married the other
Didnt you  love  either of them
asked Anne a little hesitatingly
It was not easy for her to speak to a stranger of the great mystery and transformation of life
Goodness no
I couldnt love anybody
It isnt in me
Besides I wouldnt want to
Being in love makes you a perfect slave I think
And it would give a man such power to hurt you
Id be afraid
No no Alec and Alonzo are two dear boys and I like them both so much that I really dont know which I like the better
That is the trouble
Alec is the best looking of course and I simply couldnt marry a man who wasnt handsome
He is goodtempered too and has lovely curly black hair
Hes rather too perfect  I dont believe Id like a perfect husband  somebody I could never find fault with
Then why not marry Alonzo
asked Priscilla gravely
Think of marrying a name like Alonzo
said Phil dolefully
I dont believe I could endure it
But he has a classic nose and it WOULD be a comfort to have a nose in the family that could be depended on
I cant depend on mine
So far it takes after the Gordon pattern but Im so afraid it will develop Byrne tendencies as I grow older
I examine it every day anxiously to make sure its still Gordon
Mother was a Byrne and has the Byrne nose in the Byrnest degree
Wait till you see it
I adore nice noses
Your nose is awfully nice Anne Shirley
Alonzos nose nearly turned the balance in his favor
But ALONZO
No I couldnt decide
If I could have done as I did with the hats  stood them both up together shut my eyes and jabbed with a hatpin  it would have been quite easy
What did Alec and Alonzo feel like when you came away
queried Priscilla
Oh they still have hope
I told them theyd have to wait till I could make up my mind
Theyre quite willing to wait
They both worship me you know
Meanwhile I intend to have a good time
I expect I shall have heaps of beaux at Redmond
I cant be happy unless I have you know
But dont you think the freshmen are fearfully homely
I saw only one really handsome fellow among them
He went away before you came
I heard his chum call him Gilbert
His chum had eyes that stuck out THAT FAR
But youre not going yet girls
Dont go yet
I think we must said Anne rather coldly
Its getting late and Ive some work to do
But youll both come to see me wont you
asked Philippa getting up and putting an arm around each
And let me come to see you
I want to be chummy with you
Ive taken such a fancy to you both
And I havent quite disgusted you with my frivolity have I
Not quite laughed Anne responding to Phils squeeze with a return of cordiality
Because Im not half so silly as I seem on the surface you know
You just accept Philippa Gordon as the Lord made her with all her faults and I believe youll come to like her
Isnt this graveyard a sweet place
Id love to be buried here
Heres a grave I didnt see before  this one in the iron railing  oh girls look see  the stone says its the grave of a middy who was killed in the fight between the Shannon and the Chesapeake
Just fancy
Anne paused by the railing and looked at the worn stone her pulses thrilling with sudden excitement
The old graveyard with its overarching trees and long aisles of shadows faded from her sight
Instead she saw the Kingsport Harbor of nearly a century agone
Out of the mist came slowly a great frigate brilliant with the meteor flag of England
Behind her was another with a still heroic form wrapped in his own starry flag lying on the quarter deck  the gallant Lawrence
Times finger had turned back his pages and that was the Shannon sailing triumphant up the bay with the Chesapeake as her prize
Come back Anne Shirley  come back laughed Philippa pulling her arm
Youre a hundred years away from us
Come back
Anne came back with a sigh her eyes were shining softly
Ive always loved that old story she said and although the English won that victory I think it was because of the brave defeated commander I love it
This grave seems to bring it so near and make it so real
This poor little middy was only eighteen
He died of desperate wounds received in gallant action  so reads his epitaph
It is such as a soldier might wish for
Before she turned away Anne unpinned the little cluster of purple pansies she wore and dropped it softly on the grave of the boy who had perished in the great seaduel
Well what do you think of our new friend
asked Priscilla when Phil had left them
I like her
There is something very lovable about her in spite of all her nonsense
I believe as she says herself that she isnt half as silly as she sounds
Shes a dear kissable baby  and I dont know that shell ever really grow up
I like her too said Priscilla decidedly
She talks as much about boys as Ruby Gillis does
But it always enrages or sickens me to hear Ruby whereas I just wanted to laugh goodnaturedly at Phil
Now what is the why of that
There is a difference said Anne meditatively
I think its because Ruby is really so CONSCIOUS of boys
She plays at love and lovemaking
Besides you feel when she is boasting of her beaux that she is doing it to rub it well into you that you havent half so many
Now when Phil talks of her beaux it sounds as if she was just speaking of chums
She really looks upon boys as good comrades and she is pleased when she has dozens of them tagging round simply because she likes to be popular and to be thought popular
Even Alex and Alonzo  Ill never be able to think of those two names separately after this  are to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all their lives
Im glad we met her and Im glad we went to Old St Johns
I believe Ive put forth a tiny soulroot into Kingsport soil this afternoon
I hope so
I hate to feel transplanted
Chapter V Letters from Home For the next three weeks Anne and Priscilla continued to feel as strangers in a strange land
Then suddenly everything seemed to fall into focus  Redmond professors classes students studies social doings
Life became homogeneous again instead of being made up of detached fragments
The Freshmen instead of being a collection of unrelated individuals found themselves a class with a class spirit a class yell class interests class antipathies and class ambitions
They won the day in the annual Arts Rush against the Sophomores and thereby gained the respect of all the classes and an enormous confidencegiving opinion of themselves
For three years the Sophomores had won in the rush that the victory of this year perched upon the Freshmens banner was attributed to the strategic generalship of Gilbert Blythe who marshalled the campaign and originated certain new tactics which demoralized the Sophs and swept the Freshmen to triumph
As a reward of merit he was elected president of the Freshman Class a position of honor and responsibility  from a Fresh point of view at least  coveted by many
He was also invited to join the Lambs  Redmondese for Lamba Theta  a compliment rarely paid to a Freshman
As a preparatory initiation ordeal he had to parade the principal business streets of Kingsport for a whole day wearing a sunbonnet and a voluminous kitchen apron of gaudily flowered calico
This he did cheerfully doffing his sunbonnet with courtly grace when he met ladies of his acquaintance
Charlie Sloane who had not been asked to join the Lambs told Anne he did not see how Blythe could do it and HE for his part could never humiliate himself so
Fancy Charlie Sloane in a caliker apron and a sunbunnit  giggled Priscilla
Hed look exactly like his old Grandmother Sloane
Gilbert now looked as much like a man in them as in his own proper habiliments
Anne and Priscilla found themselves in the thick of the social life of Redmond
That this came about so speedily was due in great measure to Philippa Gordon
Philippa was the daughter of a rich and wellknown man and belonged to an old and exclusive Bluenose family
This combined with her beauty and charm  a charm acknowledged by all who met her  promptly opened the gates of all cliques clubs and classes in Redmond to her and where she went Anne and Priscilla went too
Phil adored Anne and Priscilla especially Anne
She was a loyal little soul crystalfree from any form of snobbishness
Love me love my friends seemed to be her unconscious motto
Without effort she took them with her into her ever widening circle of acquaintanceship and the two Avonlea girls found their social pathway at Redmond made very easy and pleasant for them to the envy and wonderment of the other freshettes who lacking Philippas sponsorship were doomed to remain rather on the fringe of things during their first college year
To Anne and Priscilla with their more serious views of life Phil remained the amusing lovable baby she had seemed on their first meeting
Yet as she said herself she had heaps of brains
When or where she found time to study was a mystery for she seemed always in demand for some kind of fun and her home evenings were crowded with callers
She had all the beaux that heart could desire for ninetenths of the Freshmen and a big fraction of all the other classes were rivals for her smiles
She was naively delighted over this and gleefully recounted each new conquest to Anne and Priscilla with comments that might have made the unlucky lovers ears burn fiercely
Alec and Alonzo dont seem to have any serious rival yet remarked Anne teasingly
Not one agreed Philippa
I write them both every week and tell them all about my young men here
Im sure it must amuse them
But of course the one I like best I cant get
Gilbert Blythe wont take any notice of me except to look at me as if I were a nice little kitten hed like to pat
Too well I know the reason
I owe you a grudge Queen Anne
I really ought to hate you and instead I love you madly and Im miserable if I dont see you every day
Youre different from any girl I ever knew before
When you look at me in a certain way I feel what an insignificant frivolous little beast I am and I long to be better and wiser and stronger
And then I make good resolutions but the first nicelooking mannie who comes my way knocks them all out of my head
Isnt college life magnificent
Its so funny to think I hated it that first day
But if I hadnt I might never got really acquainted with you
Anne please tell me over again that you like me a little bit
I yearn to hear it
I like you a big bit  and I think youre a dear sweet adorable velvety clawless little  kitten laughed Anne but I dont see when you ever get time to learn your lessons
Phil must have found time for she held her own in every class of her year
Even the grumpy old professor of Mathematics who detested coeds and had bitterly opposed their admission to Redmond couldnt floor her
She led the freshettes everywhere except in English where Anne Shirley left her far behind
Anne herself found the studies of her Freshman year very easy thanks in great part to the steady work she and Gilbert had put in during those two past years in Avonlea
This left her more time for a social life which she thoroughly enjoyed
But never for a moment did she forget Avonlea and the friends there
To her the happiest moments in each week were those in which letters came from home
It was not until she had got her first letters that she began to think she could ever like Kingsport or feel at home there
Before they came Avonlea had seemed thousands of miles away those letters brought it near and linked the old life to the new so closely that they began to seem one and the same instead of two hopelessly segregated existences
The first batch contained six letters from Jane Andrews Ruby Gillis Diana Barry Marilla Mrs Lynde and Davy
Janes was a copperplate production with every t nicely crossed and every i precisely dotted and not an interesting sentence in it
She never mentioned the school concerning which Anne was avid to hear she never answered one of the questions Anne had asked in her letter
But she told Anne how many yards of lace she had recently crocheted and the kind of weather they were having in Avonlea and how she intended to have her new dress made and the way she felt when her head ached
Ruby Gillis wrote a gushing epistle deploring Annes absence assuring her she was horribly missed in everything asking what the Redmond fellows were like and filling the rest with accounts of her own harrowing experiences with her numerous admirers
It was a silly harmless letter and Anne would have laughed over it had it not been for the postscript
Gilbert seems to be enjoying Redmond judging from his letters wrote Ruby
I dont think Charlie is so stuck on it
So Gilbert was writing to Ruby
Very well
He had a perfect right to of course
Only  
Anne did not know that Ruby had written the first letter and that Gilbert had answered it from mere courtesy
She tossed Rubys letter aside contemptuously
But it took all Dianas breezy newsy delightful epistle to banish the sting of Rubys postscript
Dianas letter contained a little too much Fred but was otherwise crowded and crossed with items of interest and Anne almost felt herself back in Avonlea while reading it
Marillas was a rather prim and colorless epistle severely innocent of gossip or emotion
Yet somehow it conveyed to Anne a whiff of the wholesome simple life at Green Gables with its savor of ancient peace and the steadfast abiding love that was there for her
Mrs Lyndes letter was full of church news
Having broken up housekeeping Mrs Lynde had more time than ever to devote to church affairs and had flung herself into them heart and soul
She was at present much worked up over the poor supplies they were having in the vacant Avonlea pulpit
I dont believe any but fools enter the ministry nowadays she wrote bitterly
Such candidates as they have sent us and such stuff as they preach
Half of it aint true and whats worse it aint sound doctrine
The one we have now is the worst of the lot
He mostly takes a text and preaches about something else
And he says he doesnt believe all the heathen will be eternally lost
The idea
If they wont all the money weve been giving to Foreign Missions will be clean wasted thats what
Last Sunday night he announced that next Sunday hed preach on the axehead that swam
I think hed better confine himself to the Bible and leave sensational subjects alone
Things have come to a pretty pass if a minister cant find enough in Holy Writ to preach about thats what
What church do you attend Anne
I hope you go regularly
People are apt to get so careless about churchgoing away from home and I understand college students are great sinners in this respect
Im told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday
I hope youll never sink that low Anne
Remember how you were brought up
And be very careful what friends you make
You never know what sort of creatures are in them colleges
Outwardly they may be as whited sepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves thats what
Youd better not have anything to say to any young man who isnt from the Island
I forgot to tell you what happened the day the minister called here
It was the funniest thing I ever saw
I said to Marilla If Anne had been here wouldnt she have had a laugh
Even Marilla laughed
You know hes a very short fat little man with bow legs
Well that old pig of Mr Harrisons  the big tall one  had wandered over here that day again and broke into the yard and it got into the back porch unbeknowns to us and it was there when the minister appeared in the doorway
It made one wild bolt to get out but there was nowhere to bolt to except between them bow legs
So there it went and being as it was so big and the minister so little it took him clean off his feet and carried him away
His hat went one way and his cane another just as Marilla and I got to the door
Ill never forget the look of him
And that poor pig was near scared to death
Ill never be able to read that account in the Bible of the swine that rushed madly down the steep place into the sea without seeing Mr Harrisons pig careering down the hill with that minister
I guess the pig thought he had the Old Boy on his back instead of inside of him
I was thankful the twins werent about
It wouldnt have been the right thing for them to have seen a minister in such an undignified predicament
Just before they got to the brook the minister jumped off or fell off
The pig rushed through the brook like mad and up through the woods
Marilla and I run down and helped the minister get up and brush his coat
He wasnt hurt but he was mad
He seemed to hold Marilla and me responsible for it all though we told him the pig didnt belong to us and had been pestering us all summer
Besides what did he come to the back door for
Youd never have caught Mr Allan doing that
Itll be a long time before we get a man like Mr Allan
But its an ill wind that blows no good
Weve never seen hoof or hair of that pig since and its my belief we never will
Things is pretty quiet in Avonlea
I dont find Green Gables as lonesome as I expected
I think Ill start another cotton warp quilt this winter
Mrs Silas Sloane has a handsome new appleleaf pattern
When I feel that I must have some excitement I read the murder trials in that Boston paper my niece sends me
I never used to do it but theyre real interesting
The States must be an awful place
I hope youll never go there Anne
But the way girls roam over the earth now is something terrible
It always makes me think of Satan in the Book of Job going to and fro and walking up and down
I dont believe the Lord ever intended it thats what
Davy has been pretty good since you went away
One day he was bad and Marilla punished him by making him wear Doras apron all day and then he went and cut all Doras aprons up
I spanked him for that and then he went and chased my rooster to death
The MacPhersons have moved down to my place
Shes a great housekeeper and very particular
Shes rooted all my June lilies up because she says they make a garden look so untidy
Thomas set them lilies out when we were married
Her husband seems a nice sort of a man but she cant get over being an old maid thats what
Dont study too hard and be sure and put your winter underclothes on as soon as the weather gets cool
Marilla worries a lot about you but I tell her youve got a lot more sense than I ever thought you would have at one time and that youll be all right
Davys letter plunged into a grievance at the start
Dear anne please write and tell marilla not to tie me to the rale of the bridge when I go fishing the boys make fun of me when she does
Its awful lonesome here without you but grate fun in school
Jane andrews is crosser than you
I scared mrs lynde with a jacky lantern last nite
She was offel mad and she was mad cause I chased her old rooster round the yard till he fell down ded
I didnt mean to make him fall down ded
What made him die anne I want to know
mrs lynde threw him into the pig pen she mite of sold him to mr blair
mr blair is giving 50 sense apeace for good ded roosters now
I herd mrs lynde asking the minister to pray for her
What did she do that was so bad anne I want to know
Ive got a kite with a magnificent tail anne
Milty bolter told me a grate story in school yesterday
it is troo
old Joe Mosey and Leon were playing cards one nite last week in the woods
The cards were on a stump and a big black man bigger than the trees come along and grabbed the cards and the stump and disapered with a noys like thunder
Ill bet they were skared
Milty says the black man was the old harry
was he anne I want to know
Mr kimball over at spenservale is very sick and will have to go to the hospitable
please excuse me while I ask marilla if thats spelled rite
Marilla says its the silem he has to go to not the other place
He thinks he has a snake inside of him
whats it like to have a snake inside of you anne
I want to know
mrs lawrence bell is sick to
mrs lynde says that all that is the matter with her is that she thinks too much about her insides
I wonder said Anne as she folded up her letters what Mrs Lynde would think of Philippa
Chapter VI In the Park What are you going to do with yourselves today girls
asked Philippa popping into Annes room one Saturday afternoon
We are going for a walk in the park answered Anne
I ought to stay in and finish my blouse
But I couldnt sew on a day like this
Theres something in the air that gets into my blood and makes a sort of glory in my soul
My fingers would twitch and Id sew a crooked seam
So its ho for the park and the pines
Does we include any one but yourself and Priscilla
Yes it includes Gilbert and Charlie and well be very glad if it will include you also
But said Philippa dolefully if I go Ill have to be gooseberry and that will be a new experience for Philippa Gordon
Well new experiences are broadening
Come along and youll be able to sympathize with all poor souls who have to play gooseberry often
But where are all the victims
Oh I was tired of them all and simply couldnt be bothered with any of them today
Besides Ive been feeling a little blue  just a pale elusive azure
It isnt serious enough for anything darker
I wrote Alec and Alonzo last week
I put the letters into envelopes and addressed them but I didnt seal them up
That evening something funny happened
That is Alec would think it funny but Alonzo wouldnt be likely to
I was in a hurry so I snatched Alecs letter  as I thought  out of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript
Then I mailed both letters
I got Alonzos reply this morning
Girls I had put that postscript to his letter and he was furious
Of course hell get over it  and I dont care if he doesnt  but it spoiled my day
So I thought Id come to you darlings to get cheered up
After the football season opens I wont have any spare Saturday afternoons
I adore football
Ive got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in Redmond colors to wear to the games
To be sure a little way off Ill look like a walking barbers pole
Do you know that that Gilbert of yours has been elected Captain of the Freshman football team
Yes he told us so last evening said Priscilla seeing that outraged Anne would not answer
He and Charlie were down
We knew they were coming so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all Miss Adas cushions
That very elaborate one with the raised embroidery I dropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on
I thought it would be safe there
But would you believe it
Charlie Sloane made for that chair noticed the cushion behind it solemnly fished it up and sat on it the whole evening
Such a wreck of a cushion as it was
Poor Miss Ada asked me today still smiling but oh so reproachfully why I had allowed it to be sat upon
I told her I hadnt  that it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate Sloanishness and I wasnt a match for both combined
Miss Adas cushions are really getting on my nerves said Anne
She finished two new ones last week stuffed and embroidered within an inch of their lives
There being absolutely no other cushionless place to put them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing
They topple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the dark we fall over them
Last Sunday when Dr Davis prayed for all those exposed to the perils of the sea I added in thought and for all those who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too well
There
were ready and I see the boys coming through Old St Johns
Do you cast in your lot with us Phil
Ill go if I can walk with Priscilla and Charlie
That will be a bearable degree of gooseberry
That Gilbert of yours is a darling Anne but why does he go around so much with Goggleeyes
Anne stiffened
She had no great liking for Charlie Sloane but he was of Avonlea so no outsider had any business to laugh at him
Charlie and Gilbert have always been friends she said coldly
Charlie is a nice boy
Hes not to blame for his eyes
Dont tell me that
He is
He must have done something dreadful in a previous existence to be punished with such eyes
Pris and I are going to have such sport with him this afternoon
Well make fun of him to his face and hell never know it
Doubtless the abandoned Ps as Anne called them did carry out their amiable intentions
But Sloane was blissfully ignorant he thought he was quite a fine fellow to be walking with two such coeds especially Philippa Gordon the class beauty and belle
It must surely impress Anne
She would see that some people appreciated him at his real value
Gilbert and Anne loitered a little behind the others enjoying the calm still beauty of the autumn afternoon under the pines of the park on the road that climbed and twisted round the harbor shore
The silence here is like a prayer isnt it
said Anne her face upturned to the shining sky
How I love the pines
They seem to strike their roots deep into the romance of all the ages
It is so comforting to creep away now and then for a good talk with them
I always feel so happy out here
And so in mountain solitudes oertaken As by some spell divine Their cares drop from them like the needles shaken From out the gusty pine quoted Gilbert
They make our little ambitions seem rather petty dont they Anne
I think if ever any great sorrow came to me I would come to the pines for comfort said Anne dreamily
I hope no great sorrow ever will come to you Anne said Gilbert who could not connect the idea of sorrow with the vivid joyous creature beside him unwitting that those who can soar to the highest heights can also plunge to the deepest depths and that the natures which enjoy most keenly are those which also suffer most sharply
But there must  sometime mused Anne
Life seems like a cup of glory held to my lips just now
But there must be some bitterness in it  there is in every cup
I shall taste mine some day
Well I hope I shall be strong and brave to meet it
And I hope it wont be through my own fault that it will come
Do you remember what Dr Davis said last Sunday evening  that the sorrows God sent us brought comfort and strength with them while the sorrows we brought on ourselves through folly or wickedness were by far the hardest to bear
But we mustnt talk of sorrow on an afternoon like this
Its meant for the sheer joy of living isnt it
If I had my way Id shut everything out of your life but happiness and pleasure Anne said Gilbert in the tone that meant danger ahead
Then you would be very unwise rejoined Anne hastily
Im sure no life can be properly developed and rounded out without some trial and sorrow  though I suppose it is only when we are pretty comfortable that we admit it
Come  the others have got to the pavilion and are beckoning to us
They all sat down in the little pavilion to watch an autumn sunset of deep red fire and pallid gold
To their left lay Kingsport its roofs and spires dim in their shroud of violet smoke
To their right lay the harbor taking on tints of rose and copper as it stretched out into the sunset
Before them the water shimmered satin smooth and silver gray and beyond clean shaven Williams Island loomed out of the mist guarding the town like a sturdy bulldog
Its lighthouse beacon flared through the mist like a baleful star and was answered by another in the far horizon
Did you ever see such a stronglooking place
asked Philippa
I dont want Williams Island especially but Im sure I couldnt get it if I did
Look at that sentry on the summit of the fort right beside the flag
Doesnt he look as if he had stepped out of a romance
Speaking of romance said Priscilla weve been looking for heather  but of course we couldnt find any
Its too late in the season I suppose
Heather
exclaimed Anne
Heather doesnt grow in America does it
There are just two patches of it in the whole continent said Phil one right here in the park and one somewhere else in Nova Scotia I forget where
The famous Highland Regiment the Black Watch camped here one year and when the men shook out the straw of their beds in the spring some seeds of heather took root
Oh how delightful
said enchanted Anne
Lets go home around by Spofford Avenue suggested Gilbert
We can see all the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell
Spofford Avenue is the finest residential street in Kingsport
Nobody can build on it unless hes a millionaire
Oh do said Phil
Theres a perfectly killing little place I want to show you Anne
IT wasnt built by a millionaire
Its the first place after you leave the park and must have grown while Spofford Avenue was still a country road
It DID grow  it wasnt built
I dont care for the houses on the Avenue
Theyre too brand new and plateglassy
But this little spot is a dream  and its name  but wait till you see it
They saw it as they walked up the pinefringed hill from the park
Just on the crest where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road was a little white frame house with groups of pines on either side of it stretching their arms protectingly over its low roof
It was covered with red and gold vines through which its greenshuttered windows peeped
Before it was a tiny garden surrounded by a low stone wall
October though it was the garden was still very sweet with dear oldfashioned unworldly flowers and shrubs  sweet may southernwood lemon verbena alyssum petunias marigolds and chrysanthemums
A tiny brick wall in herringbone pattern led from the gate to the front porch
The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor the big lawnencircled palace of a tobacco king look exceedingly crude and showy and illbred by contrast
As Phil said it was the difference between being born and being made
Its the dearest place I ever saw said Anne delightedly
It gives me one of my old delightful funny aches
Its dearer and quainter than even Miss Lavendars stone house
Its the name I want you to notice especially said Phil
Look  in white letters around the archway over the gate
Pattys Place
Isnt that killing
Especially on this Avenue of Pinehursts and Elmwolds and Cedarcrofts
Pattys Place if you please
I adore it
Have you any idea who Patty is
asked Priscilla
Patty Spofford is the name of the old lady who owns it Ive discovered
She lives there with her niece and theyve lived there for hundreds of years more or less  maybe a little less Anne
Exaggeration is merely a flight of poetic fancy
I understand that wealthy folk have tried to buy the lot time and again  its really worth a small fortune now you know  but Patty wont sell upon any consideration
And theres an apple orchard behind the house in place of a back yard  youll see it when we get a little past  a real apple orchard on Spofford Avenue
Im going to dream about Pattys Place tonight said Anne
Why I feel as if I belonged to it
I wonder if by any chance well ever see the inside of it
It isnt likely said Priscilla
Anne smiled mysteriously
No it isnt likely
But I believe it will happen
I have a queer creepy crawly feeling  you can call it a presentiment if you like  that Pattys Place and I are going to be better acquainted yet
Chapter VII Home Again Those first three weeks at Redmond had seemed long but the rest of the term flew by on wings of wind
Before they realized it the Redmond students found themselves in the grind of Christmas examinations emerging therefrom more or less triumphantly
The honor of leading in the Freshman classes fluctuated between Anne Gilbert and Philippa Priscilla did very well Charlie Sloane scraped through respectably and comported himself as complacently as if he had led in everything
I cant really believe that this time tomorrow Ill be in Green Gables said Anne on the night before departure
But I shall be
And you Phil will be in Bolingbroke with Alec and Alonzo
Im longing to see them admitted Phil between the chocolate she was nibbling
They really are such dear boys you know
Theres to be no end of dances and drives and general jamborees
I shall never forgive you Queen Anne for not coming home with me for the holidays
Never means three days with you Phil
It was dear of you to ask me  and Id love to go to Bolingbroke some day
But I cant go this year  I MUST go home
You dont know how my heart longs for it
You wont have much of a time said Phil scornfully
Therell be one or two quilting parties I suppose and all the old gossips will talk you over to your face and behind your back
Youll die of lonesomeness child
In Avonlea
said Anne highly amused
Now if youd come with me youd have a perfectly gorgeous time
Bolingbroke would go wild over you Queen Anne  your hair and your style and oh everything
Youre so DIFFERENT
Youd be such a success  and I would bask in reflected glory  not the rose but near the rose
Do come after all Anne
Your picture of social triumphs is quite fascinating Phil but Ill paint one to offset it
Im going home to an old country farmhouse once green rather faded now set among leafless apple orchards
There is a brook below and a December fir wood beyond where Ive heard harps swept by the fingers of rain and wind
There is a pond nearby that will be gray and brooding now
There will be two oldish ladies in the house one tall and thin one short and fat and there will be two twins one a perfect model the other what Mrs Lynde calls a holy terror
There will be a little room upstairs over the porch where old dreams hang thick and a big fat glorious feather bed which will almost seem the height of luxury after a boardinghouse mattress
How do you like my picture Phil
It seems a very dull one said Phil with a grimace
Oh but Ive left out the transforming thing said Anne softly
Therell be love there Phil  faithful tender love such as Ill never find anywhere else in the world  love thats waiting for me
That makes my picture a masterpiece doesnt it even if the colors are not very brilliant
Phil silently got up tossed her box of chocolates away went up to Anne and put her arms about her
Anne I wish I was like you she said soberly
Diana met Anne at the Carmody station the next night and they drove home together under silent starsown depths of sky
Green Gables had a very festal appearance as they drove up the lane
There was a light in every window the glow breaking out through the darkness like flamered blossoms swung against the dark background of the Haunted Wood
And in the yard was a brave bonfire with two gay little figures dancing around it one of which gave an unearthly yell as the buggy turned in under the poplars
Davy means that for an Indian warwhoop said Diana
Mr Harrisons hired boy taught it to him and hes been practicing it up to welcome you with
Mrs Lynde says it has worn her nerves to a frazzle
He creeps up behind her you know and then lets go
He was determined to have a bonfire for you too
Hes been piling up branches for a fortnight and pestering Marilla to be let pour some kerosene oil over it before setting it on fire
I guess she did by the smell though Mrs Lynde said up to the last that Davy would blow himself and everybody else up if he was let
Anne was out of the buggy by this time and Davy was rapturously hugging her knees while even Dora was clinging to her hand
Isnt that a bully bonfire Anne
Just let me show you how to poke it  see the sparks
I did it for you Anne cause I was so glad you were coming home
The kitchen door opened and Marillas spare form darkened against the inner light
She preferred to meet Anne in the shadows for she was horribly afraid that she was going to cry with joy  she stern repressed Marilla who thought all display of deep emotion unseemly
Mrs Lynde was behind her sonsy kindly matronly as of yore
The love that Anne had told Phil was waiting for her surrounded her and enfolded her with its blessing and its sweetness
Nothing after all could compare with old ties old friends and old Green Gables
How starry Annes eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table how pink her cheeks how silverclear her laughter
And Diana was going to stay all night too
How like the dear old times it was
And the rosebud teaset graced the table
With Marilla the force of nature could no further go
I suppose you and Diana will now proceed to talk all night said Marilla sarcastically as the girls went upstairs
Marilla was always sarcastic after any selfbetrayal
Yes agreed Anne gaily but Im going to put Davy to bed first
He insists on that
You bet said Davy as they went along the hall
I want somebody to say my prayers to again
Its no fun saying them alone
You dont say them alone Davy
God is always with you to hear you
Well I cant see Him objected Davy
I want to pray to somebody I can see but I WONT say them to Mrs Lynde or Marilla there now
Nevertheless when Davy was garbed in his gray flannel nighty he did not seem in a hurry to begin
He stood before Anne shuffling one bare foot over the other and looked undecided
Come dear kneel down said Anne
Davy came and buried his head in Annes lap but he did not kneel down
Anne he said in a muffled voice
I dont feel like praying after all
I havent felt like it for a week now
I  I DIDNT pray last night nor the night before
Why not Davy
asked Anne gently
You  you wont be mad if I tell you
implored Davy
Anne lifted the little grayflannelled body on her knee and cuddled his head on her arm
Do I ever get mad when you tell me things Davy
Nooo you never do
But you get sorry and thats worse
Youll be awful sorry when I tell you this Anne  and youll be shamed of me I spose
Have you done something naughty Davy and is that why you cant say your prayers
No I havent done anything naughty  yet
But I want to do it
What is it Davy
I  I want to say a bad word Anne blurted out Davy with a desperate effort
I heard Mr Harrisons hired boy say it one day last week and ever since Ive been wanting to say it ALL the time  even when Im saying my prayers
Say it then Davy
Davy lifted his flushed face in amazement
But Anne its an AWFUL bad word
SAY IT
Davy gave her another incredulous look then in a low voice he said the dreadful word
The next minute his face was burrowing against her
Oh Anne Ill never say it again  never
Ill never WANT to say it again
I knew it was bad but I didnt spose it was so  so  I didnt spose it was like THAT
No I dont think youll ever want to say it again Davy  or think it either
And I wouldnt go about much with Mr Harrisons hired boy if I were you
He can make bully warwhoops said Davy a little regretfully
But you dont want your mind filled with bad words do you Davy  words that will poison it and drive out all that is good and manly
No said Davy owleyed with introspection
Then dont go with those people who use them
And now do you feel as if you could say your prayers Davy
Oh yes said Davy eagerly wriggling down on his knees I can say them now all right
I aint scared now to say if I should die before I wake like I was when I was wanting to say that word
Probably Anne and Diana did empty out their souls to each other that night but no record of their confidences has been preserved
They both looked as fresh and brighteyed at breakfast as only youth can look after unlawful hours of revelry and confession
There had been no snow up to this time but as Diana crossed the old log bridge on her homeward way the white flakes were beginning to flutter down over the fields and woods russet and gray in their dreamless sleep
Soon the faraway slopes and hills were dim and wraithlike through their gauzy scarfing as if pale autumn had flung a misty bridal veil over her hair and was waiting for her wintry bridegroom
So they had a white Christmas after all and a very pleasant day it was
In the forenoon letters and gifts came from Miss Lavendar and Paul Anne opened them in the cheerful Green Gables kitchen which was filled with what Davy sniffing in ecstasy called pretty smells
Miss Lavendar and Mr Irving are settled in their new home now reported Anne
I am sure Miss Lavendar is perfectly happy  I know it by the general tone of her letter  but theres a note from Charlotta the Fourth
She doesnt like Boston at all and she is fearfully homesick
Miss Lavendar wants me to go through to Echo Lodge some day while Im home and light a fire to air it and see that the cushions arent getting moldy
I think Ill get Diana to go over with me next week and we can spend the evening with Theodora Dix
I want to see Theodora
By the way is Ludovic Speed still going to see her
They say so said Marilla and hes likely to continue it
Folks have given up expecting that that courtship will ever arrive anywhere
Id hurry him up a bit if I was Theodora thats what said Mrs Lynde
And there is not the slightest doubt but that she would
There was also a characteristic scrawl from Philippa full of Alec and Alonzo what they said and what they did and how they looked when they saw her
But I cant make up my mind yet which to marry wrote Phil
I do wish you had come with me to decide for me
Some one will have to
When I saw Alec my heart gave a great thump and I thought He might be the right one
And then when Alonzo came thump went my heart again
So thats no guide though it should be according to all the novels Ive ever read
Now Anne YOUR heart wouldnt thump for anybody but the genuine Prince Charming would it
There must be something radically wrong with mine
But Im having a perfectly gorgeous time
How I wish you were here
Its snowing today and Im rapturous
I was so afraid wed have a green Christmas and I loathe them
You know when Christmas is a dirty grayeybrowney affair looking as if it had been left over a hundred years ago and had been in soak ever since it is called a GREEN Christmas
Dont ask me why
As Lord Dundreary says there are thome thingth no fellow can underthtand
Anne did you ever get on a street car and then discover that you hadnt any money with you to pay your fare
I did the other day
Its quite awful
I had a nickel with me when I got on the car
I thought it was in the left pocket of my coat
When I got settled down comfortably I felt for it
It wasnt there
I had a cold chill
I felt in the other pocket
Not there
I had another chill
Then I felt in a little inside pocket
All in vain
I had two chills at once
I took off my gloves laid them on the seat and went over all my pockets again
It was not there
I stood up and shook myself and then looked on the floor
The car was full of people who were going home from the opera and they all stared at me but I was past caring for a little thing like that
But I could not find my fare
I concluded I must have put it in my mouth and swallowed it inadvertently
I didnt know what to do
Would the conductor I wondered stop the car and put me off in ignominy and shame
Was it possible that I could convince him that I was merely the victim of my own absentmindedness and not an unprincipled creature trying to obtain a ride upon false pretenses
How I wished that Alec or Alonzo were there
But they werent because I wanted them
If I HADNT wanted them they would have been there by the dozen
And I couldnt decide what to say to the conductor when he came around
As soon as I got one sentence of explanation mapped out in my mind I felt nobody could believe it and I must compose another
It seemed there was nothing to do but trust in Providence and for all the comfort that gave me I might as well have been the old lady who when told by the captain during a storm that she must put her trust in the Almighty exclaimed Oh Captain is it as bad as that
Just at the conventional moment when all hope had fled and the conductor was holding out his box to the passenger next to me I suddenly remembered where I had put that wretched coin of the realm
I hadnt swallowed it after all
I meekly fished it out of the index finger of my glove and poked it in the box
I smiled at everybody and felt that it was a beautiful world
The visit to Echo Lodge was not the least pleasant of many pleasant holiday outings
Anne and Diana went back to it by the old way of the beech woods carrying a lunch basket with them
Echo Lodge which had been closed ever since Miss Lavendars wedding was briefly thrown open to wind and sunshine once more and firelight glimmered again in the little rooms
The perfume of Miss Lavendars rose bowl still filled the air
It was hardly possible to believe that Miss Lavendar would not come tripping in presently with her brown eyes astar with welcome and that Charlotta the Fourth blue of bow and wide of smile would not pop through the door
Paul too seemed hovering around with his fairy fancies
It really makes me feel a little bit like a ghost revisiting the old time glimpses of the moon laughed Anne
Lets go out and see if the echoes are at home
Bring the old horn
It is still behind the kitchen door
The echoes were at home over the white river as silverclear and multitudinous as ever and when they had ceased to answer the girls locked up Echo Lodge again and went away in the perfect half hour that follows the rose and saffron of a winter sunset
Chapter VIII Annes First Proposal The old year did not slip away in a green twilight with a pinkyyellow sunset
Instead it went out with a wild white bluster and blow
It was one of the nights when the stormwind hurtles over the frozen meadows and black hollows and moans around the eaves like a lost creature and drives the snow sharply against the shaking panes
Just the sort of night people like to cuddle down between their blankets and count their mercies said Anne to Jane Andrews who had come up to spend the afternoon and stay all night
But when they were cuddled between their blankets in Annes little porch room it was not her mercies of which Jane was thinking
Anne she said very solemnly I want to tell you something
May I Anne was feeling rather sleepy after the party Ruby Gillis had given the night before
She would much rather have gone to sleep than listen to Janes confidences which she was sure would bore her
She had no prophetic inkling of what was coming
Probably Jane was engaged too rumor averred that Ruby Gillis was engaged to the Spencervale schoolteacher about whom all the girls were said to be quite wild
Ill soon be the only fancyfree maiden of our old quartet thought Anne drowsily
Aloud she said Of course
Anne said Jane still more solemnly what do you think of my brother Billy
Anne gasped over this unexpected question and floundered helplessly in her thoughts
Goodness what DID she think of Billy Andrews
She had never thought ANYTHING about him  roundfaced stupid perpetually smiling goodnatured Billy Andrews
Did ANYBODY ever think about Billy Andrews
I  I dont understand Jane she stammered
What do you mean  exactly
Do you like Billy
asked Jane bluntly
Why  why  yes I like him of course gasped Anne wondering if she were telling the literal truth
Certainly she did not DISlike Billy
But could the indifferent tolerance with which she regarded him when he happened to be in her range of vision be considered positive enough for liking
WHAT was Jane trying to elucidate
Would you like him for a husband
asked Jane calmly
A husband
Anne had been sitting up in bed the better to wrestle with the problem of her exact opinion of Billy Andrews
Now she fell flatly back on her pillows the very breath gone out of her
Whose husband
Yours of course answered Jane
Billy wants to marry you
Hes always been crazy about you  and now father has given him the upper farm in his own name and theres nothing to prevent him from getting married
But hes so shy he couldnt ask you himself if youd have him so he got me to do it
Id rather not have but he gave me no peace till I said I would if I got a good chance
What do you think about it Anne
Was it a dream
Was it one of those nightmare things in which you find yourself engaged or married to some one you hate or dont know without the slightest idea how it ever came about
No she Anne Shirley was lying there wide awake in her own bed and Jane Andrews was beside her calmly proposing for her brother Billy
Anne did not know whether she wanted to writhe or laugh but she could do neither for Janes feelings must not be hurt
I  I couldnt marry Bill you know Jane she managed to gasp
Why such an idea never occurred to me  never
I dont suppose it did agreed Jane
Billy has always been far too shy to think of courting
But you might think it over Anne
Billy is a good fellow
I must say that if he is my brother
He has no bad habits and hes a great worker and you can depend on him
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
He told me to tell you hed be quite willing to wait till you got through college if you insisted though hed RATHER get married this spring before the planting begins
Hed always be very good to you Im sure and you know Anne Id love to have you for a sister
I cant marry Billy said Anne decidedly
She had recovered her wits and was even feeling a little angry
It was all so ridiculous
There is no use thinking of it Jane
I dont care anything for him in that way and you must tell him so
Well I didnt suppose you would said Jane with a resigned sigh feeling that she had done her best
I told Billy I didnt believe it was a bit of use to ask you but he insisted
Well youve made your decision Anne and I hope you wont regret it
Jane spoke rather coldly
She had been perfectly sure that the enamored Billy had no chance at all of inducing Anne to marry him
Nevertheless she felt a little resentment that Anne Shirley who was after all merely an adopted orphan without kith or kin should refuse her brother  one of the Avonlea Andrews
Well pride sometimes goes before a fall Jane reflected ominously
Anne permitted herself to smile in the darkness over the idea that she might ever regret not marrying Billy Andrews
I hope Billy wont feel very badly over it she said nicely
Jane made a movement as if she were tossing her head on her pillow
Oh he wont break his heart
Billy has too much good sense for that
He likes Nettie Blewett pretty well too and mother would rather he married her than any one
Shes such a good manager and saver
I think when Billy is once sure you wont have him hell take Nettie
Please dont mention this to any one will you Anne
Certainly not said Anne who had no desire whatever to publish abroad the fact that Billy Andrews wanted to marry her preferring her when all was said and done to Nettie Blewett
Nettie Blewett
And now I suppose wed better go to sleep suggested Jane
To sleep went Jane easily and speedily but though very unlike MacBeth in most respects she had certainly contrived to murder sleep for Anne
That proposedto damsel lay on a wakeful pillow until the wee smas but her meditations were far from being romantic
It was not however until the next morning that she had an opportunity to indulge in a good laugh over the whole affair
When Jane had gone home  still with a hint of frost in voice and manner because Anne had declined so ungratefully and decidedly the honor of an alliance with the House of Andrews  Anne retreated to the porch room shut the door and had her laugh out at last
If I could only share the joke with some one
she thought
But I cant
Diana is the only one Id want to tell and even if I hadnt sworn secrecy to Jane I cant tell Diana things now
She tells everything to Fred  I know she does
Well Ive had my first proposal
I supposed it would come some day  but I certainly never thought it would be by proxy
Its awfully funny  and yet theres a sting in it too somehow
Anne knew quite well wherein the sting consisted though she did not put it into words
She had had her secret dreams of the first time some one should ask her the great question
And it had in those dreams always been very romantic and beautiful and the some one was to be very handsome and darkeyed and distinguishedlooking and eloquent whether he were Prince Charming to be enraptured with yes or one to whom a regretful beautifully worded but hopeless refusal must be given
If the latter the refusal was to be expressed so delicately that it would be next best thing to acceptance and he would go away after kissing her hand assuring her of his unalterable lifelong devotion
And it would always be a beautiful memory to be proud of and a little sad about also
And now this thrilling experience had turned out to be merely grotesque
Billy Andrews had got his sister to propose for him because his father had given him the upper farm and if Anne wouldnt have him Nettie Blewett would
There was romance for you with a vengeance
Anne laughed  and then sighed
The bloom had been brushed from one little maiden dream
Would the painful process go on until everything became prosaic and humdrum
Chapter IX An Unwelcome Lover and a Welcome Friend The second term at Redmond sped as quickly as had the first  actually whizzed away Philippa said
Anne enjoyed it thoroughly in all its phases  the stimulating class rivalry the making and deepening of new and helpful friendships the gay little social stunts the doings of the various societies of which she was a member the widening of horizons and interests
She studied hard for she had made up her mind to win the Thorburn Scholarship in English
This being won meant that she could come back to Redmond the next year without trenching on Marillas small savings  something Anne was determined she would not do
Gilbert too was in full chase after a scholarship but found plenty of time for frequent calls at Thirtyeight St Johns
He was Annes escort at nearly all the college affairs and she knew that their names were coupled in Redmond gossip
Anne raged over this but was helpless she could not cast an old friend like Gilbert aside especially when he had grown suddenly wise and wary as behooved him in the dangerous proximity of more than one Redmond youth who would gladly have taken his place by the side of the slender redhaired coed whose gray eyes were as alluring as stars of evening
Anne was never attended by the crowd of willing victims who hovered around Philippas conquering march through her Freshman year but there was a lanky brainy Freshie a jolly little round Sophomore and a tall learned Junior who all liked to call at Thirtyeight St Johns and talk over ologies and isms as well as lighter subjects with Anne in the becushioned parlor of that domicile
Gilbert did not love any of them and he was exceedingly careful to give none of them the advantage over him by any untimely display of his real feelings Anneward
To her he had become again the boycomrade of Avonlea days and as such could hold his own against any smitten swain who had so far entered the lists against him
As a companion Anne honestly acknowledged nobody could be so satisfactory as Gilbert she was very glad so she told herself that he had evidently dropped all nonsensical ideas  though she spent considerable time secretly wondering why
Only one disagreeable incident marred that winter
Charlie Sloane sitting bolt upright on Miss Adas most dearly beloved cushion asked Anne one night if she would promise to become Mrs Charlie Sloane some day
Coming after Billy Andrews proxy effort this was not quite the shock to Annes romantic sensibilities that it would otherwise have been but it was certainly another heartrending disillusion
She was angry too for she felt that she had never given Charlie the slightest encouragement to suppose such a thing possible
But what could you expect of a Sloane as Mrs Rachel Lynde would ask scornfully
Charlies whole attitude tone air words fairly reeked with Sloanishness
He was conferring a great honor  no doubt whatever about that
And when Anne utterly insensible to the honor refused him as delicately and considerately as she could  for even a Sloane had feelings which ought not to be unduly lacerated  Sloanishness still further betrayed itself
Charlie certainly did not take his dismissal as Annes imaginary rejected suitors did
Instead he became angry and showed it he said two or three quite nasty things Annes temper flashed up mutinously and she retorted with a cutting little speech whose keenness pierced even Charlies protective Sloanishness and reached the quick he caught up his hat and flung himself out of the house with a very red face Anne rushed upstairs falling twice over Miss Adas cushions on the way and threw herself on her bed in tears of humiliation and rage
Had she actually stooped to quarrel with a Sloane
Was it possible anything Charlie Sloane could say had power to make her angry
Oh this was degradation indeed  worse even than being the rival of Nettie Blewett
I wish I need never see the horrible creature again she sobbed vindictively into her pillows
She could not avoid seeing him again but the outraged Charlie took care that it should not be at very close quarters
Miss Adas cushions were henceforth safe from his depredations and when he met Anne on the street or in Redmonds halls his bow was icy in the extreme
Relations between these two old schoolmates continued to be thus strained for nearly a year
Then Charlie transferred his blighted affections to a round rosy snubnosed blueeyed little Sophomore who appreciated them as they deserved whereupon he forgave Anne and condescended to be civil to her again in a patronizing manner intended to show her just what she had lost
One day Anne scurried excitedly into Priscillas room
Read that she cried tossing Priscilla a letter
Its from Stella  and shes coming to Redmond next year  and what do you think of her idea
I think its a perfectly splendid one if we can only carry it out
Do you suppose we can Pris
Ill be better able to tell you when I find out what it is said Priscilla casting aside a Greek lexicon and taking up Stellas letter
Stella Maynard had been one of their chums at Queens Academy and had been teaching school ever since
But Im going to give it up Anne dear she wrote and go to college next year
As I took the third year at Queens I can enter the Sophomore year
Im tired of teaching in a back country school
Some day Im going to write a treatise on The Trials of a Country Schoolmarm
It will be a harrowing bit of realism
It seems to be the prevailing impression that we live in clover and have nothing to do but draw our quarters salary
My treatise shall tell the truth about us
Why if a week should pass without some one telling me that I am doing easy work for big pay I would conclude that I might as well order my ascension robe immediately and to onct
Well you get your money easy some ratepayer will tell me condescendingly
All you have to do is to sit there and hear lessons
I used to argue the matter at first but Im wiser now
Facts are stubborn things but as some one has wisely said not half so stubborn as fallacies
So I only smile loftily now in eloquent silence
Why I have nine grades in my school and I have to teach a little of everything from investigating the interiors of earthworms to the study of the solar system
My youngest pupil is four  his mother sends him to school to get him out of the way  and my oldest twenty  it suddenly struck him that it would be easier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any longer
In the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours a day I dont wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was taken to see the biograph
I have to look for whats coming next before I know what went last he complained
I feel like that myself
And the letters I get Anne
Tommys mother writes me that Tommy is not coming on in arithmetic as fast as she would like
He is only in simple reduction yet and Johnny Johnson is in fractions and Johnny isnt half as smart as her Tommy and she cant understand it
And Susys father wants to know why Susy cant write a letter without misspelling half the words and Dicks aunt wants me to change his seat because that bad Brown boy he is sitting with is teaching him to say naughty words
As to the financial part  but Ill not begin on that
Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make country schoolmarms
There I feel better after that growl
After all Ive enjoyed these past two years
But Im coming to Redmond
And now Anne Ive a little plan
You know how I loathe boarding
Ive boarded for four years and Im so tired of it
I dont feel like enduring three years more of it
Now why cant you and Priscilla and I club together rent a little house somewhere in Kingsport and board ourselves
It would be cheaper than any other way
Of course we would have to have a housekeeper and I have one ready on the spot
Youve heard me speak of Aunt Jamesina
Shes the sweetest aunt that ever lived in spite of her name
She cant help that
She was called Jamesina because her father whose name was James was drowned at sea a month before she was born
I always call her Aunt Jimsie
Well her only daughter has recently married and gone to the foreign mission field
Aunt Jamesina is left alone in a great big house and she is horribly lonesome
She will come to Kingsport and keep house for us if we want her and I know youll both love her
The more I think of the plan the more I like it
We could have such good independent times
Now if you and Priscilla agree to it wouldnt it be a good idea for you who are on the spot to look around and see if you can find a suitable house this spring
That would be better than leaving it till the fall
If you could get a furnished one so much the better but if not we can scare up a few sticks of finiture between us and old family friends with attics
Anyhow decide as soon as you can and write me so that Aunt Jamesina will know what plans to make for next year
I think its a good idea said Priscilla
So do I agreed Anne delightedly
Of course we have a nice boardinghouse here but when alls said and done a boardinghouse isnt home
So lets go househunting at once before exams come on
Im afraid it will be hard enough to get a really suitable house warned Priscilla
Dont expect too much Anne
Nice houses in nice localities will probably be away beyond our means
Well likely have to content ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon live people whom to know is to be unknown and make life inside compensate for the outside
Accordingly they went househunting but to find just what they wanted proved even harder than Priscilla had feared
Houses there were galore furnished and unfurnished but one was too big another too small this one too expensive that one too far from Redmond
Exams were on and over the last week of the term came and still their house odreams as Anne called it remained a castle in the air
We shall have to give up and wait till the fall I suppose said Priscilla wearily as they rambled through the park on one of Aprils darling days of breeze and blue when the harbor was creaming and shimmering beneath the pearlhued mists floating over it
We may find some shack to shelter us then and if not boardinghouses we shall have always with us
Im not going to worry about it just now anyway and spoil this lovely afternoon said Anne gazing around her with delight
The fresh chill air was faintly charged with the aroma of pine balsam and the sky above was crystal clear and blue  a great inverted cup of blessing
Spring is singing in my blood today and the lure of April is abroad on the air
Im seeing visions and dreaming dreams Pris
Thats because the wind is from the west
I do love the west wind
It sings of hope and gladness doesnt it
When the east wind blows I always think of sorrowful rain on the eaves and sad waves on a gray shore
When I get old I shall have rheumatism when the wind is east
And isnt it jolly when you discard furs and winter garments for the first time and sally forth like this in spring attire
laughed Priscilla
Dont you feel as if you had been made over new
Everything is new in the spring said Anne
Springs themselves are always so new too
No spring is ever just like any other spring
It always has something of its own to be its own peculiar sweetness
See how green the grass is around that little pond and how the willow buds are bursting
And exams are over and gone  the time of Convocation will come soon  next Wednesday
This day next week well be home
Im glad said Anne dreamily
There are so many things I want to do
I want to sit on the back porch steps and feel the breeze blowing down over Mr Harrisons fields
I want to hunt ferns in the Haunted Wood and gather violets in Violet Vale
Do you remember the day of our golden picnic Priscilla
I want to hear the frogs singing and the poplars whispering
But Ive learned to love Kingsport too and Im glad Im coming back next fall
If I hadnt won the Thorburn I dont believe I could have
I COULDNT take any of Marillas little hoard
If we could only find a house
sighed Priscilla
Look over there at Kingsport Anne  houses houses everywhere and not one for us
Stop it Pris
The best is yet to be
Like the old Roman well find a house or build one
On a day like this theres no such word as fail in my bright lexicon
They lingered in the park until sunset living in the amazing miracle and glory and wonder of the springtide and they went home as usual by way of Spofford Avenue that they might have the delight of looking at Pattys Place
I feel as if something mysterious were going to happen right away  by the pricking of my thumbs  said Anne as they went up the slope
Its a nice storybookish feeling
Why  why  why
Priscilla Grant look over there and tell me if its true or am I seein things
Priscilla looked
Annes thumbs and eyes had not deceived her
Over the arched gateway of Pattys Place dangled a little modest sign
It said To Let Furnished
Inquire Within
Priscilla said Anne in a whisper do you suppose its possible that we could rent Pattys Place
No I dont averred Priscilla
It would be too good to be true
Fairy tales dont happen nowadays
I wont hope Anne
The disappointment would be too awful to bear
Theyre sure to want more for it than we can afford
Remember its on Spofford Avenue
We must find out anyhow said Anne resolutely
Its too late to call this evening but well come tomorrow
Oh Pris if we can get this darling spot
Ive always felt that my fortunes were linked with Pattys Place ever since I saw it first
Chapter X Pattys Place The next evening found them treading resolutely the herringbone walk through the tiny garden
The April wind was filling the pine trees with its roundelay and the grove was alive with robins  great plump saucy fellows strutting along the paths
The girls rang rather timidly and were admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden
The door opened directly into a large livingroom where by a cheery little fire sat two other ladies both of whom were also grim and ancient
Except that one looked to be about seventy and the other fifty there seemed little difference between them
Each had amazingly big lightblue eyes behind steelrimmed spectacles each wore a cap and a gray shawl each was knitting without haste and without rest each rocked placidly and looked at the girls without speaking and just behind each sat a large white china dog with round green spots all over it a green nose and green ears
Those dogs captured Annes fancy on the spot they seemed like the twin guardian deities of Pattys Place
For a few minutes nobody spoke
The girls were too nervous to find words and neither the ancient ladies nor the china dogs seemed conversationally inclined
Anne glanced about the room
What a dear place it was
Another door opened out of it directly into the pine grove and the robins came boldly up on the very step
The floor was spotted with round braided mats such as Marilla made at Green Gables but which were considered out of date everywhere else even in Avonlea
And yet here they were on Spofford Avenue
A big polished grandfathers clock ticked loudly and solemnly in a corner
There were delightful little cupboards over the mantelpiece behind whose glass doors gleamed quaint bits of china
The walls were hung with old prints and silhouettes
In one corner the stairs went up and at the first low turn was a long window with an inviting seat
It was all just as Anne had known it must be
By this time the silence had grown too dreadful and Priscilla nudged Anne to intimate that she must speak
We  we  saw by your sign that this house is to let said Anne faintly addressing the older lady who was evidently Miss Patty Spofford
Oh yes said Miss Patty
I intended to take that sign down today
Then  then we are too late said Anne sorrowfully
Youve let it to some one else
No but we have decided not to let it at all
Oh Im so sorry exclaimed Anne impulsively
I love this place so
I did hope we could have got it
Then did Miss Patty lay down her knitting take off her specs rub them put them on again and for the first time look at Anne as at a human being
The other lady followed her example so perfectly that she might as well have been a reflection in a mirror
You LOVE it said Miss Patty with emphasis
Does that mean that you really LOVE it
Or that you merely like the looks of it
The girls nowadays indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never can tell what they DO mean
It wasnt so in my young days
THEN a girl did not say she LOVED turnips in just the same tone as she might have said she loved her mother or her Savior
Annes conscience bore her up
I really do love it she said gently
Ive loved it ever since I saw it last fall
My two college chums and I want to keep house next year instead of boarding so we are looking for a little place to rent and when I saw that this house was to let I was so happy
If you love it you can have it said Miss Patty
Maria and I decided today that we would not let it after all because we did not like any of the people who have wanted it
We dont HAVE to let it
We can afford to go to Europe even if we dont let it
It would help us out but not for gold will I let my home pass into the possession of such people as have come here and looked at it
YOU are different
I believe you do love it and will be good to it
You can have it
If  if we can afford to pay what you ask for it hesitated Anne
Miss Patty named the amount required
Anne and Priscilla looked at each other
Priscilla shook her head
Im afraid we cant afford quite so much said Anne choking back her disappointment
You see we are only college girls and we are poor
What were you thinking you could afford
demanded Miss Patty ceasing not to knit
Anne named her amount
Miss Patty nodded gravely
That will do
As I told you it is not strictly necessary that we should let it at all
We are not rich but we have enough to go to Europe on
I have never been in Europe in my life and never expected or wanted to go
But my niece there Maria Spofford has taken a fancy to go
Now you know a young person like Maria cant go globetrotting alone
No  I  I suppose not murmured Anne seeing that Miss Patty was quite solemnly in earnest
Of course not
So I have to go along to look after her
I expect to enjoy it too Im seventy years old but Im not tired of living yet
I daresay Id have gone to Europe before if the idea had occurred to me
We shall be away for two years perhaps three
We sail in June and we shall send you the key and leave all in order for you to take possession when you choose
We shall pack away a few things we prize especially but all the rest will be left
Will you leave the china dogs
asked Anne timidly
Would you like me to
Oh indeed yes
They are delightful
A pleased expression came into Miss Pattys face
I think a great deal of those dogs she said proudly
They are over a hundred years old and they have sat on either side of this fireplace ever since my brother Aaron brought them from London fifty years ago
Spofford Avenue was called after my brother Aaron
A fine man he was said Miss Maria speaking for the first time
Ah you dont see the like of him nowadays
He was a good uncle to you Maria said Miss Patty with evident emotion
You do well to remember him
I shall always remember him said Miss Maria solemnly
I can see him this minute standing there before that fire with his hands under his coattails beaming on us
Miss Maria took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes but Miss Patty came resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of business
I shall leave the dogs where they are if you will promise to be very careful of them she said
Their names are Gog and Magog
Gog looks to the right and Magog to the left
And theres just one thing more
You dont object I hope to this house being called Pattys Place
No indeed
We think that is one of the nicest things about it
You have sense I see said Miss Patty in a tone of great satisfaction
Would you believe it
All the people who came here to rent the house wanted to know if they couldnt take the name off the gate during their occupation of it
I told them roundly that the name went with the house
This has been Pattys Place ever since my brother Aaron left it to me in his will and Pattys Place it shall remain until I die and Maria dies
After that happens the next possessor can call it any fool name he likes concluded Miss Patty much as she might have said After that  the deluge
And now wouldnt you like to go over the house and see it all before we consider the bargain made
Further exploration still further delighted the girls
Besides the big livingroom there was a kitchen and a small bedroom downstairs
Upstairs were three rooms one large and two small
Anne took an especial fancy to one of the small ones looking out into the big pines and hoped it would be hers
It was papered in pale blue and had a little oldtimey toilet table with sconces for candles
There was a diamondpaned window with a seat under the blue muslin frills that would be a satisfying spot for studying or dreaming
Its all so delicious that I know we are going to wake up and find it a fleeting vision of the night said Priscilla as they went away
Miss Patty and Miss Maria are hardly such stuff as dreams are made of laughed Anne
Can you fancy them globetrotting  especially in those shawls and caps
I suppose theyll take them off when they really begin to trot said Priscilla but I know theyll take their knitting with them everywhere
They simply couldnt be parted from it
They will walk about Westminster Abbey and knit I feel sure
Meanwhile Anne we shall be living in Pattys Place  and on Spofford Avenue
I feel like a millionairess even now
I feel like one of the morning stars that sang for joy said Anne
Phil Gordon crept into Thirtyeight St Johns that night and flung herself on Annes bed
Girls dear Im tired to death
I feel like the man without a country  or was it without a shadow
I forget which
Anyway Ive been packing up
And I suppose you are worn out because you couldnt decide which things to pack first or where to put them laughed Priscilla
Ezackly
And when I had got everything jammed in somehow and my landlady and her maid had both sat on it while I locked it I discovered I had packed a whole lot of things I wanted for Convocation at the very bottom
I had to unlock the old thing and poke and dive into it for an hour before I fished out what I wanted
I would get hold of something that felt like what I was looking for and Id yank it up and it would be something else
No Anne I did NOT swear
I didnt say you did
Well you looked it
But I admit my thoughts verged on the profane
And I have such a cold in the head  I can do nothing but sniffle sigh and sneeze
Isnt that alliterative agony for you
Queen Anne do say something to cheer me up
Remember that next Thursday night youll be back in the land of Alec and Alonzo suggested Anne
Phil shook her head dolefully
More alliteration
No I dont want Alec and Alonzo when I have a cold in the head
But what has happened you two
Now that I look at you closely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence
Why youre actually SHINING
Whats up
We are going to live in Pattys Place next winter said Anne triumphantly
Live mark you not board
Weve rented it and Stella Maynard is coming and her aunt is going to keep house for us
Phil bounced up wiped her nose and fell on her knees before Anne
Girls  girls  let me come too
Oh Ill be so good
If theres no room for me Ill sleep in the little doghouse in the orchard  Ive seen it
Only let me come
Get up you goose
I wont stir off my marrow bones till you tell me I can live with you next winter
Anne and Priscilla looked at each other
Then Anne said slowly Phil dear wed love to have you
But we may as well speak plainly
Im poor  Pris is poor  Stella Maynard is poor  our housekeeping will have to be very simple and our table plain
Youd have to live as we would
Now you are rich and your boardinghouse fare attests the fact
Oh what do I care for that
demanded Phil tragically
Better a dinner of herbs where your chums are than a stalled ox in a lonely boardinghouse
Dont think Im ALL stomach girls
Ill be willing to live on bread and water  with just a LEETLE jam  if youll let me come
And then continued Anne there will be a good deal of work to be done
Stellas aunt cant do it all
We all expect to have our chores to do
Now you   Toil not neither do I spin finished Philippa
But Ill learn to do things
Youll only have to show me once
I CAN make my own bed to begin with
And remember that though I cant cook I CAN keep my temper
Thats something
And I NEVER growl about the weather
Thats more
Oh please please
I never wanted anything so much in my life  and this floor is awfully hard
Theres just one more thing said Priscilla resolutely
You Phil as all Redmond knows entertain callers almost every evening
Now at Pattys Place we cant do that
We have decided that we shall be at home to our friends on Friday evenings only
If you come with us youll have to abide by that rule
Well you dont think Ill mind that do you
Why Im glad of it
I knew I should have had some such rule myself but I hadnt enough decision to make it or stick to it
When I can shuffle off the responsibility on you it will be a real relief
If you wont let me cast in my lot with you Ill die of the disappointment and then Ill come back and haunt you
Ill camp on the very doorstep of Pattys Place and you wont be able to go out or come in without falling over my spook
Again Anne and Priscilla exchanged eloquent looks
Well said Anne of course we cant promise to take you until weve consulted with Stella but I dont think shell object and as far as we are concerned you may come and glad welcome
If you get tired of our simple life you can leave us and no questions asked added Priscilla
Phil sprang up hugged them both jubilantly and went on her way rejoicing
I hope things will go right said Priscilla soberly
We must MAKE them go right avowed Anne
I think Phil will fit into our appy little ome very well
Oh Phils a dear to rattle round with and be chums
And of course the more there are of us the easier it will be on our slim purses
But how will she be to live with
You have to summer and winter with any one before you know if shes LIVABLE or not
Oh well well all be put to the test as far as that goes
And we must quit us like sensible folk living and let live
Phil isnt selfish though shes a little thoughtless and I believe we will all get on beautifully in Pattys Place
Chapter XI The Round of Life Anne was back in Avonlea with the luster of the Thorburn Scholarship on her brow
People told her she hadnt changed much in a tone which hinted they were surprised and a little disappointed she hadnt
Avonlea had not changed either
At least so it seemed at first
But as Anne sat in the Green Gables pew on the first Sunday after her return and looked over the congregation she saw several little changes which all coming home to her at once made her realize that time did not quite stand still even in Avonlea
A new minister was in the pulpit
In the pews more than one familiar face was missing forever
Old Uncle Abe his prophesying over and done with Mrs Peter Sloane who had sighed it was to be hoped for the last time Timothy Cotton who as Mrs Rachel Lynde said had actually managed to die at last after practicing at it for twenty years and old Josiah Sloane whom nobody knew in his coffin because he had his whiskers neatly trimmed were all sleeping in the little graveyard behind the church
And Billy Andrews was married to Nettie Blewett
They appeared out that Sunday
When Billy beaming with pride and happiness showed his beplumed and besilked bride into the Harmon Andrews pew Anne dropped her lids to hide her dancing eyes
She recalled the stormy winter night of the Christmas holidays when Jane had proposed for Billy
He certainly had not broken his heart over his rejection
Anne wondered if Jane had also proposed to Nettie for him or if he had mustered enough spunk to ask the fateful question himself
All the Andrews family seemed to share in his pride and pleasure from Mrs Harmon in the pew to Jane in the choir
Jane had resigned from the Avonlea school and intended to go West in the fall
Cant get a beau in Avonlea thats what said Mrs Rachel Lynde scornfully
SAYS she thinks shell have better health out West
I never heard her health was poor before
Jane is a nice girl Anne had said loyally
She never tried to attract attention as some did
Oh she never chased the boys if thats what you mean said Mrs Rachel
But shed like to be married just as much as anybody thats what
What else would take her out West to some forsaken place whose only recommendation is that men are plenty and women scarce
Dont you tell me
But it was not at Jane Anne gazed that day in dismay and surprise
It was at Ruby Gillis who sat beside her in the choir
What had happened to Ruby
She was even handsomer than ever but her blue eyes were too bright and lustrous and the color of her cheeks was hectically brilliant besides she was very thin the hands that held her hymnbook were almost transparent in their delicacy
Is Ruby Gillis ill
Anne asked of Mrs Lynde as they went home from church
Ruby Gillis is dying of galloping consumption said Mrs Lynde bluntly
Everybody knows it except herself and her FAMILY
They wont give in
If you ask THEM shes perfectly well
She hasnt been able to teach since she had that attack of congestion in the winter but she says shes going to teach again in the fall and shes after the White Sands school
Shell be in her grave poor girl when White Sands school opens thats what
Anne listened in shocked silence
Ruby Gillis her old schoolchum dying
Could it be possible
Of late years they had grown apart but the old tie of schoolgirl intimacy was there and made itself felt sharply in the tug the news gave at Annes heartstrings
Ruby the brilliant the merry the coquettish
It was impossible to associate the thought of her with anything like death
She had greeted Anne with gay cordiality after church and urged her to come up the next evening
Ill be away Tuesday and Wednesday evenings she had whispered triumphantly
Theres a concert at Carmody and a party at White Sands
Herb Spencers going to take me
Hes my LATEST
Be sure to come up tomorrow
Im dying for a good talk with you
I want to hear all about your doings at Redmond
Anne knew that Ruby meant that she wanted to tell Anne all about her own recent flirtations but she promised to go and Diana offered to go with her
Ive been wanting to go to see Ruby for a long while she told Anne when they left Green Gables the next evening but I really couldnt go alone
Its so awful to hear Ruby rattling on as she does and pretending there is nothing the matter with her even when she can hardly speak for coughing
Shes fighting so hard for her life and yet she hasnt any chance at all they say
The girls walked silently down the red twilit road
The robins were singing vespers in the high treetops filling the golden air with their jubilant voices
The silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and ponds over fields where seeds were beginning to stir with life and thrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them
The air was fragrant with the wild sweet wholesome smell of young raspberry copses
White mists were hovering in the silent hollows and violet stars were shining bluely on the brooklands
What a beautiful sunset said Diana
Look Anne its just like a land in itself isnt it
That long low back of purple cloud is the shore and the clear sky further on is like a golden sea
If we could sail to it in the moonshine boat Paul wrote of in his old composition  you remember
 how nice it would be said Anne rousing from her reverie
Do you think we could find all our yesterdays there Diana  all our old springs and blossoms
The beds of flowers that Paul saw there are the roses that have bloomed for us in the past
Dont
said Diana
You make me feel as if we were old women with everything in life behind us
I think Ive almost felt as if we were since I heard about poor Ruby said Anne
If it is true that she is dying any other sad thing might be true too
You dont mind calling in at Elisha Wrights for a moment do you
asked Diana
Mother asked me to leave this little dish of jelly for Aunt Atossa
Who is Aunt Atossa
Oh havent you heard
Shes Mrs Samson Coates of Spencervale  Mrs Elisha Wrights aunt
Shes fathers aunt too
Her husband died last winter and she was left very poor and lonely so the Wrights took her to live with them
Mother thought we ought to take her but father put his foot down
Live with Aunt Atossa he would not
Is she so terrible
asked Anne absently
Youll probably see what shes like before we can get away said Diana significantly
Father says she has a face like a hatchet  it cuts the air
But her tongue is sharper still
Late as it was Aunt Atossa was cutting potato sets in the Wright kitchen
She wore a faded old wrapper and her gray hair was decidedly untidy
Aunt Atossa did not like being caught in a kilter so she went out of her way to be disagreeable
Oh so youre Anne Shirley
she said when Diana introduced Anne
Ive heard of you
Her tone implied that she had heard nothing good
Mrs Andrews was telling me you were home
She said you had improved a good deal
There was no doubt Aunt Atossa thought there was plenty of room for further improvement
She ceased not from cutting sets with much energy
Is it any use to ask you to sit down
she inquired sarcastically
Of course theres nothing very entertaining here for you
The rest are all away
Mother sent you this little pot of rhubarb jelly said Diana pleasantly
She made it today and thought you might like some
Oh thanks said Aunt Atossa sourly
I never fancy your mothers jelly  she always makes it too sweet
However Ill try to worry some down
My appetites been dreadful poor this spring
Im far from well continued Aunt Atossa solemnly but still I keep adoing
People who cant work arent wanted here
If it isnt too much trouble will you be condescending enough to set the jelly in the pantry
Im in a hurry to get these spuds done tonight
I suppose you two LADIES never do anything like this
Youd be afraid of spoiling your hands
I used to cut potato sets before we rented the farm smiled Anne
I do it yet laughed Diana
I cut sets three days last week
Of course she added teasingly I did my hands up in lemon juice and kid gloves every night after it
Aunt Atossa sniffed
I suppose you got that notion out of some of those silly magazines you read so many of
I wonder your mother allows you
But she always spoiled you
We all thought when George married her she wouldnt be a suitable wife for him
Aunt Atossa sighed heavily as if all forebodings upon the occasion of George Barrys marriage had been amply and darkly fulfilled
Going are you
she inquired as the girls rose
Well I suppose you cant find much amusement talking to an old woman like me
Its such a pity the boys aint home
We want to run in and see Ruby Gillis a little while explained Diana
Oh anything does for an excuse of course said Aunt Atossa amiably
Just whip in and whip out before you have time to say howdo decently
Its college airs I spose
Youd be wiser to keep away from Ruby Gillis
The doctors say consumptions catching
I always knew Rubyd get something gadding off to Boston last fall for a visit
People who aint content to stay home always catch something
People who dont go visiting catch things too
Sometimes they even die said Diana solemnly
Then they dont have themselves to blame for it retorted Aunt Atossa triumphantly
I hear you are to be married in June Diana
There is no truth in that report said Diana blushing
Well dont put it off too long said Aunt Atossa significantly
Youll fade soon  youre all complexion and hair
And the Wrights are terrible fickle
You ought to wear a hat MISS SHIRLEY
Your nose is freckling scandalous
My but you ARE redheaded
Well I spose were all as the Lord made us
Give Marilla Cuthbert my respects
Shes never been to see me since I come to Avonlea but I spose I oughtnt to complain
The Cuthberts always did think themselves a cut higher than any one else round here
Oh isnt she dreadful
gasped Diana as they escaped down the lane
Shes worse than Miss Eliza Andrews said Anne
But then think of living all your life with a name like Atossa
Wouldnt it sour almost any one
She should have tried to imagine her name was Cordelia
It might have helped her a great deal
It certainly helped me in the days when I didnt like ANNE
Josie Pye will be just like her when she grows up said Diana
Josies mother and Aunt Atossa are cousins you know
Oh dear Im glad thats over
Shes so malicious  she seems to put a bad flavor in everything
Father tells such a funny story about her
One time they had a minister in Spencervale who was a very good spiritual man but very deaf
He couldnt hear any ordinary conversation at all
Well they used to have a prayer meeting on Sunday evenings and all the church members present would get up and pray in turn or say a few words on some Bible verse
But one evening Aunt Atossa bounced up
She didnt either pray or preach
Instead she lit into everybody else in the church and gave them a fearful raking down calling them right out by name and telling them how they all had behaved and casting up all the quarrels and scandals of the past ten years
Finally she wound up by saying that she was disgusted with Spencervale church and she never meant to darken its door again and she hoped a fearful judgment would come upon it
Then she sat down out of breath and the minister who hadnt heard a word she said immediately remarked in a very devout voice amen
The Lord grant our dear sisters prayer
You ought to hear father tell the story
Speaking of stories Diana remarked Anne in a significant confidential tone do you know that lately I have been wondering if I could write a short story  a story that would be good enough to be published
Why of course you could said Diana after she had grasped the amazing suggestion
You used to write perfectly thrilling stories years ago in our old Story Club
Well I hardly meant one of that kind of stories smiled Anne
Ive been thinking about it a little of late but Im almost afraid to try for if I should fail it would be too humiliating
I heard Priscilla say once that all Mrs Morgans first stories were rejected
But Im sure yours wouldnt be Anne for its likely editors have more sense nowadays
Margaret Burton one of the Junior girls at Redmond wrote a story last winter and it was published in the Canadian Woman
I really do think I could write one at least as good
And will you have it published in the Canadian Woman
I might try one of the bigger magazines first
It all depends on what kind of a story I write
What is it to be about
I dont know yet
I want to get hold of a good plot
I believe this is very necessary from an editors point of view
The only thing Ive settled on is the heroines name
It is to be AVERIL LESTER
Rather pretty dont you think
Dont mention this to any one Diana
I havent told anybody but you and Mr Harrison
HE wasnt very encouraging  he said there was far too much trash written nowadays as it was and hed expected something better of me after a year at college
What does Mr Harrison know about it
demanded Diana scornfully
They found the Gillis home gay with lights and callers
Leonard Kimball of Spencervale and Morgan Bell of Carmody were glaring at each other across the parlor
Several merry girls had dropped in
Ruby was dressed in white and her eyes and cheeks were very brilliant
She laughed and chattered incessantly and after the other girls had gone she took Anne upstairs to display her new summer dresses
Ive a blue silk to make up yet but its a little heavy for summer wear
I think Ill leave it until the fall
Im going to teach in White Sands you know
How do you like my hat
That one you had on in church yesterday was real dinky
But I like something brighter for myself
Did you notice those two ridiculous boys downstairs
Theyve both come determined to sit each other out
I dont care a single bit about either of them you know
Herb Spencer is the one I like
Sometimes I really do think hes MR
RIGHT
At Christmas I thought the Spencervale schoolmaster was that
But I found out something about him that turned me against him
He nearly went insane when I turned him down
I wish those two boys hadnt come tonight
I wanted to have a nice good talk with you Anne and tell you such heaps of things
You and I were always good chums werent we
Ruby slipped her arm about Annes waist with a shallow little laugh
But just for a moment their eyes met and behind all the luster of Rubys Anne saw something that made her heart ache
Come up often wont you Anne
whispered Ruby
Come alone  I want you
Are you feeling quite well Ruby
Me
Why Im perfectly well
I never felt better in my life
Of course that congestion last winter pulled me down a little
But just see my color
I dont look much like an invalid Im sure
Rubys voice was almost sharp
She pulled her arm away from Anne as if in resentment and ran downstairs where she was gayer than ever apparently so much absorbed in bantering her two swains that Diana and Anne felt rather out of it and soon went away
Chapter XII Averils Atonement What are you dreaming of Anne
The two girls were loitering one evening in a fairy hollow of the brook
Ferns nodded in it and little grasses were green and wild pears hung finelyscented white curtains around it
Anne roused herself from her reverie with a happy sigh
I was thinking out my story Diana
Oh have you really begun it
cried Diana all alight with eager interest in a moment
Yes I have only a few pages written but I have it all pretty well thought out
Ive had such a time to get a suitable plot
None of the plots that suggested themselves suited a girl named AVERIL
Couldnt you have changed her name
No the thing was impossible
I tried to but I couldnt do it any more than I could change yours
AVERIL was so real to me that no matter what other name I tried to give her I just thought of her as AVERIL behind it all
But finally I got a plot that matched her
Then came the excitement of choosing names for all my characters
You have no idea how fascinating that is
Ive lain awake for hours thinking over those names
The heros name is PERCEVAL DALRYMPLE
Have you named ALL the characters
asked Diana wistfully
If you hadnt I was going to ask you to let me name one  just some unimportant person
Id feel as if I had a share in the story then
You may name the little hired boy who lived with the LESTERS conceded Anne
He is not very important but he is the only one left unnamed
Call him RAYMOND FITZOSBORNE suggested Diana who had a store of such names laid away in her memory relics of the old Story Club which she and Anne and Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis had had in their schooldays
Anne shook her head doubtfully
Im afraid that is too aristocratic a name for a chore boy Diana
I couldnt imagine a Fitzosborne feeding pigs and picking up chips could you
Diana didnt see why if you had an imagination at all you couldnt stretch it to that extent but probably Anne knew best and the chore boy was finally christened ROBERT RAY to be called BOBBY should occasion require
How much do you suppose youll get for it
asked Diana
But Anne had not thought about this at all
She was in pursuit of fame not filthy lucre and her literary dreams were as yet untainted by mercenary considerations
Youll let me read it wont you
pleaded Diana
When it is finished Ill read it to you and Mr Harrison and I shall want you to criticize it SEVERELY
No one else shall see it until it is published
How are you going to end it  happily or unhappily
Im not sure
Id like it to end unhappily because that would be so much more romantic
But I understand editors have a prejudice against sad endings
I heard Professor Hamilton say once that nobody but a genius should try to write an unhappy ending
And concluded Anne modestly Im anything but a genius
Oh I like happy endings best
Youd better let him marry her said Diana who especially since her engagement to Fred thought this was how every story should end
But you like to cry over stories
Oh yes in the middle of them
But I like everything to come right at last
I must have one pathetic scene in it said Anne thoughtfully
I might let ROBERT RAY be injured in an accident and have a death scene
No you mustnt kill BOBBY off declared Diana laughing
He belongs to me and I want him to live and flourish
Kill somebody else if you have to
For the next fortnight Anne writhed or reveled according to mood in her literary pursuits
Now she would be jubilant over a brilliant idea now despairing because some contrary character would NOT behave properly
Diana could not understand this
MAKE them do as you want them to she said
I cant mourned Anne
Averil is such an unmanageable heroine
She WILL do and say things I never meant her to
Then that spoils everything that went before and I have to write it all over again
Finally however the story was finished and Anne read it to Diana in the seclusion of the porch gable
She had achieved her pathetic scene without sacrificing ROBERT RAY and she kept a watchful eye on Diana as she read it
Diana rose to the occasion and cried properly but when the end came she looked a little disappointed
Why did you kill MAURICE LENNOX
she asked reproachfully
He was the villain protested Anne
He had to be punished
I like him best of them all said unreasonable Diana
Well hes dead and hell have to stay dead said Anne rather resentfully
If I had let him live hed have gone on persecuting AVERIL and PERCEVAL
Yes  unless you had reformed him
That wouldnt have been romantic and besides it would have made the story too long
Well anyway its a perfectly elegant story Anne and will make you famous of that Im sure
Have you got a title for it
Oh I decided on the title long ago
I call it AVERILS ATONEMENT
Doesnt that sound nice and alliterative
Now Diana tell me candidly do you see any faults in my story
Well hesitated Diana that part where AVERIL makes the cake doesnt seem to me quite romantic enough to match the rest
Its just what anybody might do
Heroines shouldnt do cooking I think
Why that is where the humor comes in and its one of the best parts of the whole story said Anne
And it may be stated that in this she was quite right
Diana prudently refrained from any further criticism but Mr Harrison was much harder to please
First he told her there was entirely too much description in the story
Cut out all those flowery passages he said unfeelingly
Anne had an uncomfortable conviction that Mr Harrison was right and she forced herself to expunge most of her beloved descriptions though it took three rewritings before the story could be pruned down to please the fastidious Mr Harrison
Ive left out ALL the descriptions but the sunset she said at last
I simply COULDNT let it go
It was the best of them all
It hasnt anything to do with the story said Mr Harrison and you shouldnt have laid the scene among rich city people
What do you know of them
Why didnt you lay it right here in Avonlea  changing the name of course or else Mrs Rachel Lynde would probably think she was the heroine
Oh that would never have done protested Anne
Avonlea is the dearest place in the world but it isnt quite romantic enough for the scene of a story
I daresay theres been many a romance in Avonlea  and many a tragedy too said Mr Harrison drily
But your folks aint like real folks anywhere
They talk too much and use too highflown language
Theres one place where that DALRYMPLE chap talks even on for two pages and never lets the girl get a word in edgewise
If hed done that in real life shed have pitched him
I dont believe it said Anne flatly
In her secret soul she thought that the beautiful poetical things said to AVERIL would win any girls heart completely
Besides it was gruesome to hear of AVERIL the stately queenlike AVERIL pitching any one
AVERIL declined her suitors
Anyhow resumed the merciless Mr Harrison I dont see why MAURICE LENNOX didnt get her
He was twice the man the other is
He did bad things but he did them
Perceval hadnt time for anything but mooning
Mooning
That was even worse than pitching
MAURICE LENNOX was the villain said Anne indignantly
I dont see why every one likes him better than PERCEVAL
Perceval is too good
Hes aggravating
Next time you write about a hero put a little spice of human nature in him
AVERIL couldnt have married MAURICE
He was bad
Shed have reformed him
You can reform a man you cant reform a jellyfish of course
Your story isnt bad  its kind of interesting Ill admit
But youre too young to write a story that would be worth while
Wait ten years
Anne made up her mind that the next time she wrote a story she wouldnt ask anybody to criticize it
It was too discouraging
She would not read the story to Gilbert although she told him about it
If it is a success youll see it when it is published Gilbert but if it is a failure nobody shall ever see it
Marilla knew nothing about the venture
In imagination Anne saw herself reading a story out of a magazine to Marilla entrapping her into praise of it  for in imagination all things are possible  and then triumphantly announcing herself the author
One day Anne took to the Post Office a long bulky envelope addressed with the delightful confidence of youth and inexperience to the very biggest of the big magazines
Diana was as excited over it as Anne herself
How long do you suppose it will be before you hear from it
she asked
It shouldnt be longer than a fortnight
Oh how happy and proud I shall be if it is accepted
Of course it will be accepted and they will likely ask you to send them more
You may be as famous as Mrs Morgan some day Anne and then how proud Ill be of knowing you said Diana who possessed at least the striking merit of an unselfish admiration of the gifts and graces of her friends
A week of delightful dreaming followed and then came a bitter awakening
One evening Diana found Anne in the porch gable with suspiciouslooking eyes
On the table lay a long envelope and a crumpled manuscript
Anne your story hasnt come back
cried Diana incredulously
Yes it has said Anne shortly
Well that editor must be crazy
What reason did he give
No reason at all
There is just a printed slip saying that it wasnt found acceptable
I never thought much of that magazine anyway said Diana hotly
The stories in it are not half as interesting as those in the Canadian Woman although it costs so much more
I suppose the editor is prejudiced against any one who isnt a Yankee
Dont be discouraged Anne
Remember how Mrs Morgans stories came back
Send yours to the Canadian Woman
I believe I will said Anne plucking up heart
And if it is published Ill send that American editor a marked copy
But Ill cut the sunset out
I believe Mr Harrison was right
Out came the sunset but in spite of this heroic mutilation the editor of the Canadian Woman sent Averils Atonement back so promptly that the indignant Diana declared that it couldnt have been read at all and vowed she was going to stop her subscription immediately
Anne took this second rejection with the calmness of despair
She locked the story away in the garret trunk where the old Story Club tales reposed but first she yielded to Dianas entreaties and gave her a copy
This is the end of my literary ambitions she said bitterly
She never mentioned the matter to Mr Harrison but one evening he asked her bluntly if her story had been accepted
No the editor wouldnt take it she answered briefly
Mr Harrison looked sidewise at the flushed delicate profile
Well I suppose youll keep on writing them he said encouragingly
No I shall never try to write a story again declared Anne with the hopeless finality of nineteen when a door is shut in its face
I wouldnt give up altogether said Mr Harrison reflectively
Id write a story once in a while but I wouldnt pester editors with it
Id write of people and places like I knew and Id make my characters talk everyday English and Id let the sun rise and set in the usual quiet way without much fuss over the fact
If I had to have villains at all Id give them a chance Anne  Id give them a chance
There are some terrible bad men in the world I suppose but youd have to go a long piece to find them  though Mrs Lynde believes were all bad
But most of us have got a little decency somewhere in us
Keep on writing Anne
No
It was very foolish of me to attempt it
When Im through Redmond Ill stick to teaching
I can teach
I cant write stories
Itll be time for you to be getting a husband when youre through Redmond said Mr Harrison
I dont believe in putting marrying off too long  like I did
Anne got up and marched home
There were times when Mr Harrison was really intolerable
Pitching mooning and getting a husband
Ow
Chapter XIII The Way of Transgressors Davy and Dora were ready for Sunday School
They were going alone which did not often happen for Mrs Lynde always attended Sunday School
But Mrs Lynde had twisted her ankle and was lame so she was staying home this morning
The twins were also to represent the family at church for Anne had gone away the evening before to spend Sunday with friends in Carmody and Marilla had one of her headaches
Davy came downstairs slowly
Dora was waiting in the hall for him having been made ready by Mrs Lynde
Davy had attended to his own preparations
He had a cent in his pocket for the Sunday School collection and a fivecent piece for the church collection he carried his Bible in one hand and his Sunday School quarterly in the other he knew his lesson and his Golden Text and his catechism question perfectly
Had he not studied them  perforce  in Mrs Lyndes kitchen all last Sunday afternoon
Davy therefore should have been in a placid frame of mind
As a matter of fact despite text and catechism he was inwardly as a ravening wolf
Mrs Lynde limped out of her kitchen as he joined Dora
Are you clean
she demanded severely
Yes  all of me that shows Davy answered with a defiant scowl
Mrs Rachel sighed
She had her suspicions about Davys neck and ears
But she knew that if she attempted to make a personal examination Davy would likely take to his heels and she could not pursue him today
Well be sure you behave yourselves she warned them
Dont walk in the dust
Dont stop in the porch to talk to the other children
Dont squirm or wriggle in your places
Dont forget the Golden Text
Dont lose your collection or forget to put it in
Dont whisper at prayer time and dont forget to pay attention to the sermon
Davy deigned no response
He marched away down the lane followed by the meek Dora
But his soul seethed within
Davy had suffered or thought he had suffered many things at the hands and tongue of Mrs Rachel Lynde since she had come to Green Gables for Mrs Lynde could not live with anybody whether they were nine or ninety without trying to bring them up properly
And it was only the preceding afternoon that she had interfered to influence Marilla against allowing Davy to go fishing with the Timothy Cottons
Davy was still boiling over this
As soon as he was out of the lane Davy stopped and twisted his countenance into such an unearthly and terrific contortion that Dora although she knew his gifts in that respect was honestly alarmed lest he should never in the world be able to get it straightened out again
Darn her exploded Davy
Oh Davy dont swear gasped Dora in dismay
Darn isnt swearing  not real swearing
And I dont care if it is retorted Davy recklessly
Well if you MUST say dreadful words dont say them on Sunday pleaded Dora
Davy was as yet far from repentance but in his secret soul he felt that perhaps he had gone a little too far
Im going to invent a swear word of my own he declared
God will punish you if you do said Dora solemnly
Then I think God is a mean old scamp retorted Davy
Doesnt He know a fellow must have some way of spressing his feelings
Davy
said Dora
She expected that Davy would be struck down dead on the spot
But nothing happened
Anyway I aint going to stand any more of Mrs Lyndes bossing spluttered Davy
Anne and Marilla may have the right to boss me but SHE hasnt
Im going to do every single thing she told me not to do
You watch me
In grim deliberate silence while Dora watched him with the fascination of horror Davy stepped off the green grass of the roadside ankle deep into the fine dust which four weeks of rainless weather had made on the road and marched along in it shuffling his feet viciously until he was enveloped in a hazy cloud
Thats the beginning he announced triumphantly
And Im going to stop in the porch and talk as long as theres anybody there to talk to
Im going to squirm and wriggle and whisper and Im going to say I dont know the Golden Text
And Im going to throw away both of my collections RIGHT NOW
And Davy hurled cent and nickel over Mr Barrys fence with fierce delight
Satan made you do that said Dora reproachfully
He didnt cried Davy indignantly
I just thought it out for myself
And Ive thought of something else
Im not going to Sunday School or church at all
Im going up to play with the Cottons
They told me yesterday they werent going to Sunday School today cause their mother was away and there was nobody to make them
Come along Dora well have a great time
I dont want to go protested Dora
Youve got to said Davy
If you dont come Ill tell Marilla that Frank Bell kissed you in school last Monday
I couldnt help it
I didnt know he was going to cried Dora blushing scarlet
Well you didnt slap him or seem a bit cross retorted Davy
Ill tell her THAT too if you dont come
Well take the short cut up this field
Im afraid of those cows protested poor Dora seeing a prospect of escape
The very idea of your being scared of those cows scoffed Davy
Why theyre both younger than you
Theyre bigger said Dora
They wont hurt you
Come along now
This is great
When I grow up I aint going to bother going to church at all
I believe I can get to heaven by myself
Youll go to the other place if you break the Sabbath day said unhappy Dora following him sorely against her will
But Davy was not scared  yet
Hell was very far off and the delights of a fishing expedition with the Cottons were very near
He wished Dora had more spunk
She kept looking back as if she were going to cry every minute and that spoiled a fellows fun
Hang girls anyway
Davy did not say darn this time even in thought
He was not sorry  yet  that he had said it once but it might be as well not to tempt the Unknown Powers too far on one day
The small Cottons were playing in their back yard and hailed Davys appearance with whoops of delight
Pete Tommy Adolphus and Mirabel Cotton were all alone
Their mother and older sisters were away
Dora was thankful Mirabel was there at least
She had been afraid she would be alone in a crowd of boys
Mirabel was almost as bad as a boy  she was so noisy and sunburned and reckless
But at least she wore dresses
Weve come to go fishing announced Davy
Whoop yelled the Cottons
They rushed away to dig worms at once Mirabel leading the van with a tin can
Dora could have sat down and cried
Oh if only that hateful Frank Bell had never kissed her
Then she could have defied Davy and gone to her beloved Sunday School
They dared not of course go fishing on the pond where they would be seen by people going to church
They had to resort to the brook in the woods behind the Cotton house
But it was full of trout and they had a glorious time that morning  at least the Cottons certainly had and Davy seemed to have it
Not being entirely bereft of prudence he had discarded boots and stockings and borrowed Tommy Cottons overalls
Thus accoutered bog and marsh and undergrowth had no terrors for him
Dora was frankly and manifestly miserable
She followed the others in their peregrinations from pool to pool clasping her Bible and quarterly tightly and thinking with bitterness of soul of her beloved class where she should be sitting that very moment before a teacher she adored
Instead here she was roaming the woods with those halfwild Cottons trying to keep her boots clean and her pretty white dress free from rents and stains
Mirabel had offered the loan of an apron but Dora had scornfully refused
The trout bit as they always do on Sundays
In an hour the transgressors had all the fish they wanted so they returned to the house much to Doras relief
She sat primly on a hencoop in the yard while the others played an uproarious game of tag and then they all climbed to the top of the pighouse roof and cut their initials on the saddleboard
The flatroofed henhouse and a pile of straw beneath gave Davy another inspiration
They spent a splendid half hour climbing on the roof and diving off into the straw with whoops and yells
But even unlawful pleasures must come to an end
When the rumble of wheels over the pond bridge told that people were going home from church Davy knew they must go
He discarded Tommys overalls resumed his own rightful attire and turned away from his string of trout with a sigh
No use to think of taking them home
Well hadnt we a splendid time
he demanded defiantly as they went down the hill field
I hadnt said Dora flatly
And I dont believe you had  really  either she added with a flash of insight that was not to be expected of her
I had so cried Davy but in the voice of one who doth protest too much
No wonder you hadnt  just sitting there like a  like a mule
I aint going to sociate with the Cottons said Dora loftily
The Cottons are all right retorted Davy
And they have far better times than we have
They do just as they please and say just what they like before everybody
Im going to do that too after this
There are lots of things you wouldnt dare say before everybody averred Dora
No there isnt
There is too
Would you demanded Dora gravely would you say tomcat before the minister
This was a staggerer
Davy was not prepared for such a concrete example of the freedom of speech
But one did not have to be consistent with Dora
Of course not he admitted sulkily
Tomcat isnt a holy word
I wouldnt mention such an animal before a minister at all
But if you had to
persisted Dora
Id call it a Thomas pussy said Davy
I think gentleman cat would be more polite reflected Dora
YOU thinking
retorted Davy with withering scorn
Davy was not feeling comfortable though he would have died before he admitted it to Dora
Now that the exhilaration of truant delights had died away his conscience was beginning to give him salutary twinges
After all perhaps it would have been better to have gone to Sunday School and church
Mrs Lynde might be bossy but there was always a box of cookies in her kitchen cupboard and she was not stingy
At this inconvenient moment Davy remembered that when he had torn his new school pants the week before Mrs Lynde had mended them beautifully and never said a word to Marilla about them
But Davys cup of iniquity was not yet full
He was to discover that one sin demands another to cover it
They had dinner with Mrs Lynde that day and the first thing she asked Davy was Were all your class in Sunday School today
Yesm said Davy with a gulp
All were there  cept one
Did you say your Golden Text and catechism
Yesm
Did you put your collection in
Yesm
Was Mrs Malcolm MacPherson in church
I dont know
This at least was the truth thought wretched Davy
Was the Ladies Aid announced for next week
Yesm  quakingly
Was prayermeeting
I  I dont know
YOU should know
You should listen more attentively to the announcements
What was Mr Harveys text
Davy took a frantic gulp of water and swallowed it and the last protest of conscience together
He glibly recited an old Golden Text learned several weeks ago
Fortunately Mrs Lynde now stopped questioning him but Davy did not enjoy his dinner
He could only eat one helping of pudding
Whats the matter with you
demanded justly astonished Mrs Lynde
Are you sick
No muttered Davy
You look pale
Youd better keep out of the sun this afternoon admonished Mrs Lynde
Do you know how many lies you told Mrs
Lynde
asked Dora reproachfully as soon as they were alone after dinner
Davy goaded to desperation turned fiercely
I dont know and I dont care he said
You just shut up Dora Keith
Then poor Davy betook himself to a secluded retreat behind the woodpile to think over the way of transgressors
Green Gables was wrapped in darkness and silence when Anne reached home
She lost no time going to bed for she was very tired and sleepy
There had been several Avonlea jollifications the preceding week involving rather late hours
Annes head was hardly on her pillow before she was half asleep but just then her door was softly opened and a pleading voice said Anne
Anne sat up drowsily
Davy is that you
What is the matter
A whiteclad figure flung itself across the floor and on to the bed
Anne sobbed Davy getting his arms about her neck
Im awful glad youre home
I couldnt go to sleep till Id told somebody
Told somebody what
How misrubul I am
Why are you miserable dear
Cause I was so bad today Anne
Oh I was awful bad  baddern Ive ever been yet
What did you do
Oh Im afraid to tell you
Youll never like me again Anne
I couldnt say my prayers tonight
I couldnt tell God what Id done
I was shamed to have Him know
But He knew anyway Davy
Thats what Dora said
But I thought praps He mightnt have noticed just at the time
Anyway Id rather tell you first
WHAT is it you did
Out it all came in a rush
I run away from Sunday School  and went fishing with the Cottons  and I told ever so many whoppers to Mrs Lynde  oh
most half a dozen  and  and  I  I said a swear word Anne  a pretty near swear word anyhow  and I called God names
There was silence
Davy didnt know what to make of it
Was Anne so shocked that she never would speak to him again
Anne what are you going to do to me
he whispered
Nothing dear
Youve been punished already I think
No I havent
Nothings been done to me
Youve been very unhappy ever since you did wrong havent you
You bet
said Davy emphatically
That was your conscience punishing you Davy
Whats my conscience
I want to know
Its something in you Davy that always tells you when you are doing wrong and makes you unhappy if you persist in doing it
Havent you noticed that
Yes but I didnt know what it was
I wish I didnt have it
Id have lots more fun
Where is my conscience Anne
I want to know
Is it in my stomach
No its in your soul answered Anne thankful for the darkness since gravity must be preserved in serious matters
I spose I cant get clear of it then said Davy with a sigh
Are you going to tell Marilla and Mrs Lynde on me Anne
No dear Im not going to tell any one
You are sorry you were naughty arent you
You bet
And youll never be bad like that again
No but   added Davy cautiously I might be bad some other way
You wont say naughty words or run away on Sundays or tell falsehoods to cover up your sins
No
It doesnt pay said Davy
Well Davy just tell God you are sorry and ask Him to forgive you
Have YOU forgiven me Anne
Yes dear
Then said Davy joyously I dont care much whether God does or not
Davy
Oh  Ill ask Him  Ill ask Him said Davy quickly scrambling off the bed convinced by Annes tone that he must have said something dreadful
I dont mind asking Him Anne
 Please God Im awful sorry I behaved bad today and Ill try to be good on Sundays always and please forgive me
 There now Anne
Well now run off to bed like a good boy
All right
Say I dont feel misrubul any more
I feel fine
Good night
Good night
Anne slipped down on her pillows with a sigh of relief
Oh  how sleepy  she was
In another second  Anne
Davy was back again by her bed
Anne dragged her eyes open
What is it now dear
she asked trying to keep a note of impatience out of her voice
Anne have you ever noticed how Mr Harrison spits
Do you spose if I practice hard I can learn to spit just like him
Anne sat up
Davy Keith she said go straight to your bed and dont let me catch you out of it again tonight
Go now
Davy went and stood not upon the order of his going
Chapter XIV The Summons Anne was sitting with Ruby Gillis in the Gillis garden after the day had crept lingeringly through it and was gone
It had been a warm smoky summer afternoon
The world was in a splendor of outflowering
The idle valleys were full of hazes
The woodways were pranked with shadows and the fields with the purple of the asters
Anne had given up a moonlight drive to the White Sands beach that she might spend the evening with Ruby
She had so spent many evenings that summer although she often wondered what good it did any one and sometimes went home deciding that she could not go again
Ruby grew paler as the summer waned the White Sands school was given up  her father thought it better that she shouldnt teach till New Years  and the fancy work she loved oftener and oftener fell from hands grown too weary for it
But she was always gay always hopeful always chattering and whispering of her beaux and their rivalries and despairs
It was this that made Annes visits hard for her
What had once been silly or amusing was gruesome now it was death peering through a wilful mask of life
Yet Ruby seemed to cling to her and never let her go until she had promised to come again soon
Mrs Lynde grumbled about Annes frequent visits and declared she would catch consumption even Marilla was dubious
Every time you go to see Ruby you come home looking tired out she said
Its so very sad and dreadful said Anne in a low tone
Ruby doesnt seem to realize her condition in the least
And yet I somehow feel she needs help  craves it  and I want to give it to her and cant
All the time Im with her I feel as if I were watching her struggle with an invisible foe  trying to push it back with such feeble resistance as she has
That is why I come home tired
But tonight Anne did not feel this so keenly
Ruby was strangely quiet
She said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and fellows
She lay in the hammock with her untouched work beside her and a white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders
Her long yellow braids of hair  how Anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldays
 lay on either side of her
She had taken the pins out  they made her head ache she said
The hectic flush was gone for the time leaving her pale and childlike
The moon rose in the silvery sky empearling the clouds around her
Below the pond shimmered in its hazy radiance
Just beyond the Gillis homestead was the church with the old graveyard beside it
The moonlight shone on the white stones bringing them out in clearcut relief against the dark trees behind
How strange the graveyard looks by moonlight
said Ruby suddenly
How ghostly
she shuddered
Anne it wont be long now before Ill be lying over there
You and Diana and all the rest will be going about full of life  and Ill be there  in the old graveyard  dead
The surprise of it bewildered Anne
For a few moments she could not speak
You know its so dont you
said Ruby insistently
Yes I know answered Anne in a low tone
Dear Ruby I know
Everybody knows it said Ruby bitterly
I know it  Ive known it all summer though I wouldnt give in
And oh Anne  she reached out and caught Annes hand pleadingly impulsively  I dont want to die
Im AFRAID to die
Why should you be afraid Ruby
asked Anne quietly
Because  because  oh Im not afraid but that Ill go to heaven Anne
Im a church member
But  itll be all so different
I think  and think  and I get so frightened  and  and  homesick
Heaven must be very beautiful of course the Bible says so  but Anne IT WONT BE WHAT IVE BEEN USED TO
Through Annes mind drifted an intrusive recollection of a funny story she had heard Philippa Gordon tell  the story of some old man who had said very much the same thing about the world to come
It had sounded funny then  she remembered how she and Priscilla had laughed over it
But it did not seem in the least humorous now coming from Rubys pale trembling lips
It was sad tragic  and true
Heaven could not be what Ruby had been used to
There had been nothing in her gay frivolous life her shallow ideals and aspirations to fit her for that great change or make the life to come seem to her anything but alien and unreal and undesirable
Anne wondered helplessly what she could say that would help her
Could she say anything
I think Ruby she began hesitatingly  for it was difficult for Anne to speak to any one of the deepest thoughts of her heart or the new ideas that had vaguely begun to shape themselves in her mind concerning the great mysteries of life here and hereafter superseding her old childish conceptions and it was hardest of all to speak of them to such as Ruby Gillis  I think perhaps we have very mistaken ideas about heaven  what it is and what it holds for us
I dont think it can be so very different from life here as most people seem to think
I believe well just go on living a good deal as we live here  and be OURSELVES just the same  only it will be easier to be good and to  follow the highest
All the hindrances and perplexities will be taken away and we shall see clearly
Dont be afraid Ruby
I cant help it said Ruby pitifully
Even if what you say about heaven is true  and you cant be sure  it may be only that imagination of yours  it wont be JUST the same
It CANT be
I want to go on living HERE
Im so young Anne
I havent had my life
Ive fought so hard to live  and it isnt any use  I have to die  and leave EVERYTHING I care for
Anne sat in a pain that was almost intolerable
She could not tell comforting falsehoods and all that Ruby said was so horribly true
She WAS leaving everything she cared for
She had laid up her treasures on earth only she had lived solely for the little things of life  the things that pass  forgetting the great things that go onward into eternity bridging the gulf between the two lives and making of death a mere passing from one dwelling to the other  from twilight to unclouded day
God would take care of her there  Anne believed  she would learn  but now it was no wonder her soul clung in blind helplessness to the only things she knew and loved
Ruby raised herself on her arm and lifted up her bright beautiful blue eyes to the moonlit skies
I want to live she said in a trembling voice
I want to live like other girls
I  I want to be married Anne  and  and  have little children
You know I always loved babies Anne
I couldnt say this to any one but you
I know you understand
And then poor Herb  he  he loves me and I love him Anne
The others meant nothing to me but HE does  and if I could live I would be his wife and be so happy
Oh Anne its hard
Ruby sank back on her pillows and sobbed convulsively
Anne pressed her hand in an agony of sympathy  silent sympathy which perhaps helped Ruby more than broken imperfect words could have done for presently she grew calmer and her sobs ceased
Im glad Ive told you this Anne she whispered
It has helped me just to say it all out
Ive wanted to all summer  every time you came
I wanted to talk it over with you  but I COULDNT
It seemed as if it would make death so SURE if I SAID I was going to die or if any one else said it or hinted it
I wouldnt say it or even think it
In the daytime when people were around me and everything was cheerful it wasnt so hard to keep from thinking of it
But in the night when I couldnt sleep  it was so dreadful Anne
I couldnt get away from it then
Death just came and stared me in the face until I got so frightened I could have screamed
But you wont be frightened any more Ruby will you
Youll be brave and believe that all is going to be well with you
Ill try
Ill think over what you have said and try to believe it
And youll come up as often as you can wont you Anne
Yes dear
It  it wont be very long now Anne
I feel sure of that
And Id rather have you than any one else
I always liked you best of all the girls I went to school with
You were never jealous or mean like some of them were
Poor Em White was up to see me yesterday
You remember Em and I were such chums for three years when we went to school
And then we quarrelled the time of the school concert
Weve never spoken to each other since
Wasnt it silly
Anything like that seems silly NOW
But Em and I made up the old quarrel yesterday
She said shed have spoken years ago only she thought I wouldnt
And I never spoke to her because I was sure she wouldnt speak to me
Isnt it strange how people misunderstand each other Anne
Most of the trouble in life comes from misunderstanding I think said Anne
I must go now Ruby
Its getting late  and you shouldnt be out in the damp
Youll come up soon again
Yes very soon
And if theres anything I can do to help you Ill be so glad
I know
You HAVE helped me already
Nothing seems quite so dreadful now
Good night Anne
Good night dear
Anne walked home very slowly in the moonlight
The evening had changed something for her
Life held a different meaning a deeper purpose
On the surface it would go on just the same but the deeps had been stirred
It must not be with her as with poor butterfly Ruby
When she came to the end of one life it must not be to face the next with the shrinking terror of something wholly different  something for which accustomed thought and ideal and aspiration had unfitted her
The little things of life sweet and excellent in their place must not be the things lived for the highest must be sought and followed the life of heaven must be begun here on earth
That good night in the garden was for all time
Anne never saw Ruby in life again
The next night the AVIS
gave a farewell party to Jane Andrews before her departure for the West
And while light feet danced and bright eyes laughed and merry tongues chattered there came a summons to a soul in Avonlea that might not be disregarded or evaded
The next morning the word went from house to house that Ruby Gillis was dead
She had died in her sleep painlessly and calmly and on her face was a smile  as if after all death had come as a kindly friend to lead her over the threshold instead of the grisly phantom she had dreaded
Mrs Rachel Lynde said emphatically after the funeral that Ruby Gillis was the handsomest corpse she ever laid eyes on
Her loveliness as she lay whiteclad among the delicate flowers that Anne had placed about her was remembered and talked of for years in Avonlea
Ruby had always been beautiful but her beauty had been of the earth earthy it had had a certain insolent quality in it as if it flaunted itself in the beholders eye spirit had never shone through it intellect had never refined it
But death had touched it and consecrated it bringing out delicate modelings and purity of outline never seen before  doing what life and love and great sorrow and deep womanhood joys might have done for Ruby
Anne looking down through a mist of tears at her old playfellow thought she saw the face God had meant Ruby to have and remembered it so always
Mrs Gillis called Anne aside into a vacant room before the funeral procession left the house and gave her a small packet
I want you to have this she sobbed
Ruby would have liked you to have it
Its the embroidered centerpiece she was working at
It isnt quite finished  the needle is sticking in it just where her poor little fingers put it the last time she laid it down the afternoon before she died
Theres always a piece of unfinished work left said Mrs Lynde with tears in her eyes
But I suppose theres always some one to finish it
How difficult it is to realize that one we have always known can really be dead said Anne as she and Diana walked home
Ruby is the first of our schoolmates to go
One by one sooner or later all the rest of us must follow
Yes I suppose so said Diana uncomfortably
She did not want to talk of that
She would have preferred to have discussed the details of the funeral  the splendid white velvet casket Mr Gillis had insisted on having for Ruby  the Gillises must always make a splurge even at funerals quoth Mrs Rachel Lynde  Herb Spencers sad face the uncontrolled hysteric grief of one of Rubys sisters  but Anne would not talk of these things
She seemed wrapped in a reverie in which Diana felt lonesomely that she had neither lot nor part
Ruby Gillis was a great girl to laugh said Davy suddenly
Will she laugh as much in heaven as she did in Avonlea Anne
I want to know
Yes I think she will said Anne
Oh Anne protested Diana with a rather shocked smile
Well why not Diana
asked Anne seriously
Do you think well never laugh in heaven
Oh  I  I dont know floundered Diana
It doesnt seem just right somehow
You know its rather dreadful to laugh in church
But heaven wont be like church  all the time said Anne
I hope it aint said Davy emphatically
If it is I dont want to go
Church is awful dull
Anyway I dont mean to go for ever so long
I mean to live to be a hundred years old like Mr Thomas Blewett of White Sands
He says hes lived so long cause he always smoked tobacco and it killed all the germs
Can I smoke tobacco pretty soon Anne
No Davy I hope youll never use tobacco said Anne absently
Whatll you feel like if the germs kill me then
demanded Davy
Chapter XV A Dream Turned Upside Down Just one more week and we go back to Redmond said Anne
She was happy at the thought of returning to work classes and Redmond friends
Pleasing visions were also being woven around Pattys Place
There was a warm pleasant sense of home in the thought of it even though she had never lived there
But the summer had been a very happy one too  a time of glad living with summer suns and skies a time of keen delight in wholesome things a time of renewing and deepening of old friendships a time in which she had learned to live more nobly to work more patiently to play more heartily
All life lessons are not learned at college she thought
Life teaches them everywhere
But alas the final week of that pleasant vacation was spoiled for Anne by one of those impish happenings which are like a dream turned upside down
Been writing any more stories lately
inquired Mr Harrison genially one evening when Anne was taking tea with him and Mrs Harrison
No answered Anne rather crisply
Well no offense meant
Mrs Hiram Sloane told me the other day that a big envelope addressed to the Rollings Reliable Baking Powder Company of Montreal had been dropped into the post office box a month ago and she suspicioned that somebody was trying for the prize theyd offered for the best story that introduced the name of their baking powder
She said it wasnt addressed in your writing but I thought maybe it was you
Indeed no
I saw the prize offer but Id never dream of competing for it
I think it would be perfectly disgraceful to write a story to advertise a baking powder
It would be almost as bad as Judson Parkers patent medicine fence
So spake Anne loftily little dreaming of the valley of humiliation awaiting her
That very evening Diana popped into the porch gable brighteyed and rosy cheeked carrying a letter
Oh Anne heres a letter for you
I was at the office so I thought Id bring it along
Do open it quick
If it is what I believe it is I shall just be wild with delight
Anne puzzled opened the letter and glanced over the typewritten contents
Miss Anne Shirley Green Gables Avonlea PE
Island
DEAR MADAM We have much pleasure in informing you that your charming story Averils Atonement has won the prize of twentyfive dollars offered in our recent competition
We enclose the check herewith
We are arranging for the publication of the story in several prominent Canadian newspapers and we also intend to have it printed in pamphlet form for distribution among our patrons
Thanking you for the interest you have shown in our enterprise we remain Yours very truly THE ROLLINGS RELIABLE BAKING POWDER Co I dont understand said Anne blankly
Diana clapped her hands
Oh I KNEW it would win the prize  I was sure of it
I sent your story into the competition Anne
Diana  Barry
Yes I did said Diana gleefully perching herself on the bed
When I saw the offer I thought of your story in a minute and at first I thought Id ask you to send it in
But then I was afraid you wouldnt  you had so little faith left in it
So I just decided Id send the copy you gave me and say nothing about it
Then if it didnt win the prize youd never know and you wouldnt feel badly over it because the stories that failed were not to be returned and if it did youd have such a delightful surprise
Diana was not the most discerning of mortals but just at this moment it struck her that Anne was not looking exactly overjoyed
The surprise was there beyond doubt  but where was the delight
Why Anne you dont seem a bit pleased
she exclaimed
Anne instantly manufactured a smile and put it on
Of course I couldnt be anything but pleased over your unselfish wish to give me pleasure she said slowly
But you know  Im so amazed  I cant realize it  and I dont understand
There wasnt a word in my story about  about   Anne choked a little over the word  baking powder
Oh I put that in said Diana reassured
It was as easy as wink  and of course my experience in our old Story Club helped me
You know the scene where Averil makes the cake
Well I just stated that she used the Rollings Reliable in it and that was why it turned out so well and then in the last paragraph where PERCEVAL clasps AVERIL in his arms and says Sweetheart the beautiful coming years will bring us the fulfilment of our home of dreams I added in which we will never use any baking powder except Rollings Reliable
Oh gasped poor Anne as if some one had dashed cold water on her
And youve won the twentyfive dollars continued Diana jubilantly
Why I heard Priscilla say once that the Canadian Woman only pays five dollars for a story
Anne held out the hateful pink slip in shaking fingers
I cant take it  its yours by right Diana
You sent the story in and made the alterations
I  I would certainly never have sent it
So you must take the check
Id like to see myself said Diana scornfully
Why what I did wasnt any trouble
The honor of being a friend of the prizewinner is enough for me
Well I must go
I should have gone straight home from the post office for we have company
But I simply had to come and hear the news
Im so glad for your sake Anne
Anne suddenly bent forward put her arms about Diana and kissed her cheek
I think you are the sweetest and truest friend in the world Diana she said with a little tremble in her voice and I assure you I appreciate the motive of what youve done
Diana pleased and embarrassed got herself away and poor Anne after flinging the innocent check into her bureau drawer as if it were bloodmoney cast herself on her bed and wept tears of shame and outraged sensibility
Oh she could never live this down  never
Gilbert arrived at dusk brimming over with congratulations for he had called at Orchard Slope and heard the news
But his congratulations died on his lips at sight of Annes face
Why Anne what is the matter
I expected to find you radiant over winning Rollings Reliable prize
Good for you
Oh Gilbert not you implored Anne in an ETTU BRUTE tone
I thought YOU would understand
Cant you see how awful it is
I must confess I cant
WHAT is wrong
Everything moaned Anne
I feel as if I were disgraced forever
What do you think a mother would feel like if she found her child tattooed over with a baking powder advertisement
I feel just the same
I loved my poor little story and I wrote it out of the best that was in me
And it is SACRILEGE to have it degraded to the level of a baking powder advertisement
Dont you remember what Professor Hamilton used to tell us in the literature class at Queens
He said we were never to write a word for a low or unworthy motive but always to cling to the very highest ideals
What will he think when he hears Ive written a story to advertise Rollings Reliable
And oh when it gets out at Redmond
Think how Ill be teased and laughed at
That you wont said Gilbert wondering uneasily if it were that confounded Juniors opinion in particular over which Anne was worried
The Reds will think just as I thought  that you being like nine out of ten of us not overburdened with worldly wealth had taken this way of earning an honest penny to help yourself through the year
I dont see that theres anything low or unworthy about that or anything ridiculous either
One would rather write masterpieces of literature no doubt  but meanwhile board and tuition fees have to be paid
This commonsense matteroffact view of the case cheered Anne a little
At least it removed her dread of being laughed at though the deeper hurt of an outraged ideal remained
Chapter XVI Adjusted Relationships Its the homiest spot I ever saw  its homier than home avowed Philippa Gordon looking about her with delighted eyes
They were all assembled at twilight in the big livingroom at Pattys Place  Anne and Priscilla Phil and Stella Aunt Jamesina Rusty Joseph the SarahCat and Gog and Magog
The firelight shadows were dancing over the walls the cats were purring and a huge bowl of hothouse chrysanthemums sent to Phil by one of the victims shone through the golden gloom like creamy moons
It was three weeks since they had considered themselves settled and already all believed the experiment would be a success
The first fortnight after their return had been a pleasantly exciting one they had been busy setting up their household goods organizing their little establishment and adjusting different opinions
Anne was not oversorry to leave Avonlea when the time came to return to college
The last few days of her vacation had not been pleasant
Her prize story had been published in the Island papers and Mr William Blair had upon the counter of his store a huge pile of pink green and yellow pamphlets containing it one of which he gave to every customer
He sent a complimentary bundle to Anne who promptly dropped them all in the kitchen stove
Her humiliation was the consequence of her own ideals only for Avonlea folks thought it quite splendid that she should have won the prize
Her many friends regarded her with honest admiration her few foes with scornful envy
Josie Pye said she believed Anne Shirley had just copied the story she was sure she remembered reading it in a paper years before
The Sloanes who had found out or guessed that Charlie had been turned down said they didnt think it was much to be proud of almost any one could have done it if she tried
Aunt Atossa told Anne she was very sorry to hear she had taken to writing novels nobody born and bred in Avonlea would do it that was what came of adopting orphans from goodness knew where with goodness knew what kind of parents
Even Mrs Rachel Lynde was darkly dubious about the propriety of writing fiction though she was almost reconciled to it by that twentyfive dollar check
It is perfectly amazing the price they pay for such lies thats what she said halfproudly halfseverely
All things considered it was a relief when goingaway time came
And it was very jolly to be back at Redmond a wise experienced Soph with hosts of friends to greet on the merry opening day
Pris and Stella and Gilbert were there Charlie Sloane looking more important than ever a Sophomore looked before Phil with the AlecandAlonzo question still unsettled and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson
Moody Spurgeon had been teaching school ever since leaving Queens but his mother had concluded it was high time he gave it up and turned his attention to learning how to be a minister
Poor Moody Spurgeon fell on hard luck at the very beginning of his college career
Half a dozen ruthless Sophs who were among his fellowboarders swooped down upon him one night and shaved half of his head
In this guise the luckless Moody Spurgeon had to go about until his hair grew again
He told Anne bitterly that there were times when he had his doubts as to whether he was really called to be a minister
Aunt Jamesina did not come until the girls had Pattys Place ready for her
Miss Patty had sent the key to Anne with a letter in which she said Gog and Magog were packed in a box under the spareroom bed but might be taken out when wanted in a postscript she added that she hoped the girls would be careful about putting up pictures
The living room had been newly papered five years before and she and Miss Maria did not want any more holes made in that new paper than was absolutely necessary
For the rest she trusted everything to Anne
How those girls enjoyed putting their nest in order
As Phil said it was almost as good as getting married
You had the fun of homemaking without the bother of a husband
All brought something with them to adorn or make comfortable the little house
Pris and Phil and Stella had knickknacks and pictures galore which latter they proceeded to hang according to taste in reckless disregard of Miss Pattys new paper
Well putty the holes up when we leave dear  shell never know they said to protesting Anne
Diana had given Anne a pine needle cushion and Miss Ada had given both her and Priscilla a fearfully and wonderfully embroidered one
Marilla had sent a big box of preserves and darkly hinted at a hamper for Thanksgiving and Mrs Lynde gave Anne a patchwork quilt and loaned her five more
You take them she said authoritatively
They might as well be in use as packed away in that trunk in the garret for moths to gnaw
No moths would ever have ventured near those quilts for they reeked of mothballs to such an extent that they had to be hung in the orchard of Pattys Place a full fortnight before they could be endured indoors
Verily aristocratic Spofford Avenue had rarely beheld such a display
The gruff old millionaire who lived next door came over and wanted to buy the gorgeous red and yellow tulippattern one which Mrs Rachel had given Anne
He said his mother used to make quilts like that and by Jove he wanted one to remind him of her
Anne would not sell it much to his disappointment but she wrote all about it to Mrs Lynde
That highlygratified lady sent word back that she had one just like it to spare so the tobacco king got his quilt after all and insisted on having it spread on his bed to the disgust of his fashionable wife
Mrs Lyndes quilts served a very useful purpose that winter
Pattys Place for all its many virtues had its faults also
It was really a rather cold house and when the frosty nights came the girls were very glad to snuggle down under Mrs Lyndes quilts and hoped that the loan of them might be accounted unto her for righteousness
Anne had the blue room she had coveted at sight
Priscilla and Stella had the large one
Phil was blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen and Aunt Jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the livingroom
Rusty at first slept on the doorstep
Anne walking home from Redmond a few days after her return became aware that the people that she met surveyed her with a covert indulgent smile
Anne wondered uneasily what was the matter with her
Was her hat crooked
Was her belt loose
Craning her head to investigate Anne for the first time saw Rusty
Trotting along behind her close to her heels was quite the most forlorn specimen of the cat tribe she had ever beheld
The animal was well past kittenhood lank thin disreputable looking
Pieces of both ears were lacking one eye was temporarily out of repair and one jowl ludicrously swollen
As for color if a once black cat had been well and thoroughly singed the result would have resembled the hue of this waifs thin draggled unsightly fur
Anne shooed but the cat would not shoo
As long as she stood he sat back on his haunches and gazed at her reproachfully out of his one good eye when she resumed her walk he followed
Anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of Pattys Place which she coldly shut in his face fondly supposing she had seen the last of him
But when fifteen minutes later Phil opened the door there sat the rustybrown cat on the step
More he promptly darted in and sprang upon Annes lap with a halfpleading halftriumphant miaow
Anne said Stella severely do you own that animal
No I do NOT protested disgusted Anne
The creature followed me home from somewhere
I couldnt get rid of him
Ugh get down
I like decent cats reasonably well but I dont like beasties of your complexion
Pussy however refused to get down
He coolly curled up in Annes lap and began to purr
He has evidently adopted you laughed Priscilla
I wont BE adopted said Anne stubbornly
The poor creature is starving said Phil pityingly
Why his bones are almost coming through his skin
Well Ill give him a square meal and then he must return to whence he came said Anne resolutely
The cat was fed and put out
In the morning he was still on the doorstep
On the doorstep he continued to sit bolting in whenever the door was opened
No coolness of welcome had the least effect on him of nobody save Anne did he take the least notice
Out of compassion the girls fed him but when a week had passed they decided that something must be done
The cats appearance had improved
His eye and cheek had resumed their normal appearance he was not quite so thin and he had been seen washing his face
But for all that we cant keep him said Stella
Aunt Jimsie is coming next week and she will bring the Sarahcat with her
We cant keep two cats and if we did this Rusty Coat would fight all the time with the Sarahcat
Hes a fighter by nature
He had a pitched battle last evening with the tobaccokings cat and routed him horse foot and artillery
We must get rid of him agreed Anne looking darkly at the subject of their discussion who was purring on the hearth rug with an air of lamblike meekness
But the question is  how
How can four unprotected females get rid of a cat who wont be got rid of
We must chloroform him said Phil briskly
That is the most humane way
Who of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat
demanded Anne gloomily
I do honey
Its one of my few  sadly few  useful accomplishments
Ive disposed of several at home
You take the cat in the morning and give him a good breakfast
Then you take an old burlap bag  theres one in the back porch  put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box
Then take a twoounce bottle of chloroform uncork it and slip it under the edge of the box
Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening
The cat will be dead curled up peacefully as if he were asleep
No pain  no struggle
It sounds easy said Anne dubiously
It IS easy
Just leave it to me
Ill see to it said Phil reassuringly
Accordingly the chloroform was procured and the next morning Rusty was lured to his doom
He ate his breakfast licked his chops and climbed into Annes lap
Annes heart misgave her
This poor creature loved her  trusted her
How could she be a party to this destruction
Here take him she said hastily to Phil
I feel like a murderess
He wont suffer you know comforted Phil but Anne had fled
The fatal deed was done in the back porch
Nobody went near it that day
But at dusk Phil declared that Rusty must be buried
Pris and Stella must dig his grave in the orchard declared Phil and Anne must come with me to lift the box off
Thats the part I always hate
The two conspirators tiptoed reluctantly to the back porch
Phil gingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box
Suddenly faint but distinct sounded an unmistakable mew under the box
He  he isnt dead gasped Anne sitting blankly down on the kitchen doorstep
He must be said Phil incredulously
Another tiny mew proved that he wasnt
The two girls stared at each other
What will we do
questioned Anne
Why in the world dont you come
demanded Stella appearing in the doorway
Weve got the grave ready
What silent still and silent all
she quoted teasingly
Oh no the voices of the dead Sound like the distant torrents fall promptly counterquoted Anne pointing solemnly to the box
A burst of laughter broke the tension
We must leave him here till morning said Phil replacing the stone
He hasnt mewed for five minutes
Perhaps the mews we heard were his dying groan
Or perhaps we merely imagined them under the strain of our guilty consciences
But when the box was lifted in the morning Rusty bounded at one gay leap to Annes shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately
Never was there a cat more decidedly alive
Heres a knot hole in the box groaned Phil
I never saw it
Thats why he didnt die
Now weve got to do it all over again
No we havent declared Anne suddenly
Rusty isnt going to be killed again
Hes my cat  and youve just got to make the best of it
Oh well if youll settle with Aunt Jimsie and the Sarahcat said Stella with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair
From that time Rusty was one of the family
He slept onights on the scrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land
By the time Aunt Jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably respectable
But like Kiplings cat he walked by himself
His paw was against every cat and every cats paw against him
One by one he vanquished the aristocratic felines of Spofford Avenue
As for human beings he loved Anne and Anne alone
Nobody else even dared stroke him
An angry spit and something that sounded much like very improper language greeted any one who did
The airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable declared Stella
Him was a nice old pussens him was vowed Anne cuddling her pet defiantly
Well I dont know how he and the Sarahcat will ever make out to live together said Stella pesimistically
Catfights in the orchard onights are bad enough
But catfights here in the livingroom are unthinkable
In due time Aunt Jamesina arrived
Anne and Priscilla and Phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously but when Aunt Jamesina was enthroned in the rocking chair before the open fire they figuratively bowed down and worshipped her
Aunt Jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little softlytriangular face and large soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable youth and as full of hopes as a girls
She had pink cheeks and snowwhite hair which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears
Its a very oldfashioned way she said knitting industriously at something as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud
But I am oldfashioned
My clothes are and it stands to reason my opinions are too
I dont say theyre any the better of that mind you
In fact I daresay theyre a good deal the worse
But theyve worn nice and easy
New shoes are smarter than old ones but the old ones are more comfortable
Im old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes and opinions
I mean to take it real easy here
I know you expect me to look after you and keep you proper but Im not going to do it
Youre old enough to know how to behave if youre ever going to be
So as far as I am concerned concluded Aunt Jamesina with a twinkle in her young eyes you can all go to destruction in your own way
Oh will somebody separate those cats
pleaded Stella shudderingly
Aunt Jamesina had brought with her not only the Sarahcat but Joseph
Joseph she explained had belonged to a dear friend of hers who had gone to live in Vancouver
She couldnt take Joseph with her so she begged me to take him
I really couldnt refuse
Hes a beautiful cat  that is his disposition is beautiful
She called him Joseph because his coat is of many colors
It certainly was
Joseph as the disgusted Stella said looked like a walking ragbag
It was impossible to say what his ground color was
His legs were white with black spots on them
His back was gray with a huge patch of yellow on one side and a black patch on the other
His tail was yellow with a gray tip
One ear was black and one yellow
A black patch over one eye gave him a fearfully rakish look
In reality he was meek and inoffensive of a sociable disposition
In one respect if in no other Joseph was like a lily of the field
He toiled not neither did he spin or catch mice
Yet Solomon in all his glory slept not on softer cushions or feasted more fully on fat things
Joseph and the Sarahcat arrived by express in separate boxes
After they had been released and fed Joseph selected the cushion and corner which appealed to him and the Sarahcat gravely sat herself down before the fire and proceeded to wash her face
She was a large sleek grayandwhite cat with an enormous dignity which was not at all impaired by any consciousness of her plebian origin
She had been given to Aunt Jamesina by her washerwoman
Her name was Sarah so my husband always called puss the Sarahcat explained Aunt Jamesina
She is eight years old and a remarkable mouser
Dont worry Stella
The Sarahcat NEVER fights and Joseph rarely
Theyll have to fight here in selfdefense said Stella
At this juncture Rusty arrived on the scene
He bounded joyously half way across the room before he saw the intruders
Then he stopped short his tail expanded until it was as big as three tails
The fur on his back rose up in a defiant arch Rusty lowered his head uttered a fearful shriek of hatred and defiance and launched himself at the Sarahcat
The stately animal had stopped washing her face and was looking at him curiously
She met his onslaught with one contemptuous sweep of her capable paw
Rusty went rolling helplessly over on the rug he picked himself up dazedly
What sort of a cat was this who had boxed his ears
He looked dubiously at the Sarahcat
Would he or would he not
The Sarahcat deliberately turned her back on him and resumed her toilet operations
Rusty decided that he would not
He never did
From that time on the Sarahcat ruled the roost
Rusty never again interfered with her
But Joseph rashly sat up and yawned
Rusty burning to avenge his disgrace swooped down upon him
Joseph pacific by nature could fight upon occasion and fight well
The result was a series of drawn battles
Every day Rusty and Joseph fought at sight
Anne took Rustys part and detested Joseph
Stella was in despair
But Aunt Jamesina only laughed
Let them fight it out she said tolerantly
Theyll make friends after a bit
Joseph needs some exercise  he was getting too fat
And Rusty has to learn he isnt the only cat in the world
Eventually Joseph and Rusty accepted the situation and from sworn enemies became sworn friends
They slept on the same cushion with their paws about each other and gravely washed each others faces
Weve all got used to each other said Phil
And Ive learned how to wash dishes and sweep a floor
But you neednt try to make us believe you can chloroform a cat laughed Anne
It was all the fault of the knothole protested Phil
It was a good thing the knothole was there said Aunt Jamesina rather severely
Kittens HAVE to be drowned I admit or the world would be overrun
But no decent grownup cat should be done to death  unless he sucks eggs
You wouldnt have thought Rusty very decent if youd seen him when he came here said Stella
He positively looked like the Old Nick
I dont believe Old Nick can be so very ugly said Aunt Jamesina reflectively
He wouldnt do so much harm if he was
I always think of him as a rather handsome gentleman
Chapter XVII A Letter from Davy Its beginning to snow girls said Phil coming in one November evening and there are the loveliest little stars and crosses all over the garden walk
I never noticed before what exquisite things snowflakes really are
One has time to notice things like that in the simple life
Bless you all for permitting me to live it
Its really delightful to feel worried because butter has gone up five cents a pound
Has it
demanded Stella who kept the household accounts
It has  and heres your butter
Im getting quite expert at marketing
Its better fun than flirting concluded Phil gravely
Everything is going up scandalously sighed Stella
Never mind
Thank goodness air and salvation are still free said Aunt Jamesina
And so is laughter added Anne
Theres no tax on it yet and that is well because youre all going to laugh presently
Im going to read you Davys letter
His spelling has improved immensely this past year though he is not strong on apostrophes and he certainly possesses the gift of writing an interesting letter
Listen and laugh before we settle down to the evenings studygrind
Dear Anne ran Davys letter I take my pen to tell you that we are all pretty well and hope this will find you the same
Its snowing some today and Marilla says the old woman in the sky is shaking her feather beds
Is the old woman in the sky Gods wife Anne
I want to know
Mrs Lynde has been real sick but she is better now
She fell down the cellar stairs last week
When she fell she grabbed hold of the shelf with all the milk pails and stewpans on it and it gave way and went down with her and made a splendid crash
Marilla thought it was an earthquake at first
One of the stewpans was all dinged up and Mrs Lynde straned her ribs
The doctor came and gave her medicine to rub on her ribs but she didnt under stand him and took it all inside instead
The doctor said it was a wonder it dident kill her but it dident and it cured her ribs and Mrs Lynde says doctors dont know much anyhow
But we couldent fix up the stewpan
Marilla had to throw it out
Thanksgiving was last week
There was no school and we had a great dinner
I et mince pie and rost turkey and frut cake and donuts and cheese and jam and choklut cake
Marilla said Id die but I dident
Dora had earake after it only it wasent in her ears it was in her stummick
I dident have earake anywhere
Our new teacher is a man
He does things for jokes
Last week he made all us thirdclass boys write a composishun on what kind of a wife wed like to have and the girls on what kind of a husband
He laughed fit to kill when he read them
This was mine
I thought youd like to see it
The kind of a wife Id like to Have
She must have good manners and get my meals on time and do what I tell her and always be very polite to me
She must be fifteen yers old
She must be good to the poor and keep her house tidy and be good tempered and go to church regularly
She must be very handsome and have curly hair
If I get a wife that is just what I like Ill be an awful good husband to her
I think a woman ought to be awful good to her husband
Some poor women havent any husbands
THE END
I was at Mrs Isaac Wrights funeral at White Sands last week
The husband of the corpse felt real sorry
Mrs Lynde says Mrs Wrights grandfather stole a sheep but Marilla says we mustent speak ill of the dead
Why mustent we Anne
I want to know
Its pretty safe aint it
Mrs Lynde was awful mad the other day because I asked her if she was alive in Noahs time
I dident mean to hurt her feelings
I just wanted to know
Was she Anne
Mr Harrison wanted to get rid of his dog
So he hunged him once but he come to life and scooted for the barn while Mr Harrison was digging the grave so he hunged him again and he stayed dead that time
Mr Harrison has a new man working for him
Hes awful okward
Mr Harrison says he is left handed in both his feet
Mr Barrys hired man is lazy
Mrs Barry says that but Mr Barry says he aint lazy exactly only he thinks it easier to pray for things than to work for them
Mrs Harmon Andrews prize pig that she talked so much of died in a fit
Mrs Lynde says it was a judgment on her for pride
But I think it was hard on the pig
Milty Boulter has been sick
The doctor gave him medicine and it tasted horrid
I offered to take it for him for a quarter but the Boulters are so mean
Milty says hed rather take it himself and save his money
I asked Mrs Boulter how a person would go about catching a man and she got awful mad and said she dident know shed never chased men
The AVIS
is going to paint the hall again
Theyre tired of having it blue
The new minister was here to tea last night
He took three pieces of pie
If I did that Mrs Lynde would call me piggy
And he et fast and took big bites and Marilla is always telling me not to do that
Why can ministers do what boys cant
I want to know
I havent any more news
Here are six kisses

Dora sends one
Heres hers

Your loving friend DAVID KEITH PS
Anne who was the devils father
I want to know
Chapter XVIII Miss Josepine Remembers the Annegirl When Christmas holidays came the girls of Pattys Place scattered to their respective homes but Aunt Jamesina elected to stay where she was
I couldnt go to any of the places Ive been invited and take those three cats she said
And Im not going to leave the poor creatures here alone for nearly three weeks
If we had any decent neighbors who would feed them I might but theres nothing except millionaires on this street
So Ill stay here and keep Pattys Place warm for you
Anne went home with the usual joyous anticipations  which were not wholly fulfilled
She found Avonlea in the grip of such an early cold and stormy winter as even the oldest inhabitant could not recall
Green Gables was literally hemmed in by huge drifts
Almost every day of that illstarred vacation it stormed fiercely and even on fine days it drifted unceasingly
No sooner were the roads broken than they filled in again
It was almost impossible to stir out
The AVIS
tried on three evenings to have a party in honor of the college students and on each evening the storm was so wild that nobody could go so they gave up the attempt in despair
Anne despite her love of and loyalty to Green Gables could not help thinking longingly of Pattys Place its cosy open fire Aunt Jamesinas mirthful eyes the three cats the merry chatter of the girls the pleasantness of Friday evenings when college friends dropped in to talk of grave and gay
Anne was lonely Diana during the whole of the holidays was imprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis
She could not come to Green Gables and it was rarely Anne could get to Orchard Slope for the old way through the Haunted Wood was impassable with drifts and the long way over the frozen Lake of Shining Waters was almost as bad
Ruby Gillis was sleeping in the whiteheaped graveyard Jane Andrews was teaching a school on western prairies
Gilbert to be sure was still faithful and waded up to Green Gables every possible evening
But Gilberts visits were not what they once were
Anne almost dreaded them
It was very disconcerting to look up in the midst of a sudden silence and find Gilberts hazel eyes fixed upon her with a quite unmistakable expression in their grave depths and it was still more disconcerting to find herself blushing hotly and uncomfortably under his gaze just as if  just as if  well it was very embarrassing
Anne wished herself back at Pattys Place where there was always somebody else about to take the edge off a delicate situation
At Green Gables Marilla went promptly to Mrs Lyndes domain when Gilbert came and insisted on taking the twins with her
The significance of this was unmistakable and Anne was in a helpless fury over it
Davy however was perfectly happy
He reveled in getting out in the morning and shoveling out the paths to the well and henhouse
He gloried in the Christmastide delicacies which Marilla and Mrs Lynde vied with each other in preparing for Anne and he was reading an enthralling tale in a school library book of a wonderful hero who seemed blessed with a miraculous faculty for getting into scrapes from which he was usually delivered by an earthquake or a volcanic explosion which blew him high and dry out of his troubles landed him in a fortune and closed the story with proper ECLAT
I tell you its a bully story Anne he said ecstatically
Id ever so much rather read it than the Bible
Would you
smiled Anne
Davy peered curiously at her
You dont seem a bit shocked Anne
Mrs Lynde was awful shocked when I said it to her
No Im not shocked Davy
I think its quite natural that a nineyearold boy would sooner read an adventure story than the Bible
But when you are older I hope and think that you will realize what a wonderful book the Bible is
Oh I think some parts of it are fine conceded Davy
That story about Joseph now  its bully
But if Id been Joseph I wouldnt have forgive the brothers
No siree Anne
Id have cut all their heads off
Mrs Lynde was awful mad when I said that and shut the Bible up and said shed never read me any more of it if I talked like that
So I dont talk now when she reads it Sunday afternoons I just think things and say them to Milty Boulter next day in school
I told Milty the story about Elisha and the bears and it scared him so hes never made fun of Mr Harrisons bald head once
Are there any bears on PE
Island Anne
I want to know
Not nowadays said Anne absently as the wind blew a scud of snow against the window
Oh dear will it ever stop storming
God knows said Davy airily preparing to resume his reading
Anne WAS shocked this time
Davy
she exclaimed reproachfully
Mrs Lynde says that protested Davy
One night last week Marilla said Will Ludovic Speed and Theodora Dix EVER get married and Mrs Lynde said God knows  just like that
Well it wasnt right for her to say it said Anne promptly deciding upon which horn of this dilemma to empale herself
It isnt right for anybody to take that name in vain or speak it lightly Davy
Dont ever do it again
Not if I say it slow and solemn like the minister
queried Davy gravely
No not even then
Well I wont
Ludovic Speed and Theodora Dix live in Middle Grafton and Mrs Rachel says he has been courting her for a hundred years
Wont they soon be too old to get married Anne
I hope Gilbert wont court YOU that long
When are you going to be married Anne
Mrs Lynde says its a sure thing
Mrs Lynde is a  began Anne hotly then stopped
Awful old gossip completed Davy calmly
Thats what every one calls her
But is it a sure thing Anne
I want to know
Youre a very silly little boy Davy said Anne stalking haughtily out of the room
The kitchen was deserted and she sat down by the window in the fast falling wintry twilight
The sun had set and the wind had died down
A pale chilly moon looked out behind a bank of purple clouds in the west
The sky faded out but the strip of yellow along the western horizon grew brighter and fiercer as if all the stray gleams of light were concentrating in one spot the distant hills rimmed with priestlike firs stood out in dark distinctness against it
Anne looked across the still white fields cold and lifeless in the harsh light of that grim sunset and sighed
She was very lonely and she was sad at heart for she was wondering if she would be able to return to Redmond next year
It did not seem likely
The only scholarship possible in the Sophomore year was a very small affair
She would not take Marillas money and there seemed little prospect of being able to earn enough in the summer vacation
I suppose Ill just have to drop out next year she thought drearily and teach a district school again until I earn enough to finish my course
And by that time all my old class will have graduated and Pattys Place will be out of the question
But there
Im not going to be a coward
Im thankful I can earn my way through if necessary
Heres Mr Harrison wading up the lane announced Davy running out
I hope hes brought the mail
Its three days since we got it
I want to see what them pesky Grits are doing
Im a Conservative Anne
And I tell you you have to keep your eye on them Grits
Mr Harrison had brought the mail and merry letters from Stella and Priscilla and Phil soon dissipated Annes blues
Aunt Jamesina too had written saying that she was keeping the hearthfire alight and that the cats were all well and the house plants doing fine
The weather has been real cold she wrote so I let the cats sleep in the house  Rusty and Joseph on the sofa in the livingroom and the Sarahcat on the foot of my bed
Its real company to hear her purring when I wake up in the night and think of my poor daughter in the foreign field
If it was anywhere but in India I wouldnt worry but they say the snakes out there are terrible
It takes all the Sarahcatss purring to drive away the thought of those snakes
I have enough faith for everything but the snakes
I cant think why Providence ever made them
Sometimes I dont think He did
Im inclined to believe the Old Harry had a hand in making THEM
Anne had left a thin typewritten communication till the last thinking it unimportant
When she had read it she sat very still with tears in her eyes
What is the matter Anne
asked Marilla
Miss Josephine Barry is dead said Anne in a low tone
So she has gone at last said Marilla
Well she has been sick for over a year and the Barrys have been expecting to hear of her death any time
It is well she is at rest for she has suffered dreadfully Anne
She was always kind to you
She has been kind to the last Marilla
This letter is from her lawyer
She has left me a thousand dollars in her will
Gracious aint that an awful lot of money exclaimed Davy
Shes the woman you and Diana lit on when you jumped into the spare room bed aint she
Diana told me that story
Is that why she left you so much
Hush Davy said Anne gently
She slipped away to the porch gable with a full heart leaving Marilla and Mrs Lynde to talk over the news to their hearts content
Do you spose Anne will ever get married now
speculated Davy anxiously
When Dorcas Sloane got married last summer she said if shed had enough money to live on shed never have been bothered with a man but even a widower with eight children was bettern living with a sisterinlaw
Davy Keith do hold your tongue said Mrs Rachel severely
The way you talk is scandalous for a small boy thats what
Chapter XIX An Interlude To think that this is my twentieth birthday and that Ive left my teens behind me forever said Anne who was curled up on the hearthrug with Rusty in her lap to Aunt Jamesina who was reading in her pet chair
They were alone in the living room
Stella and Priscilla had gone to a committee meeting and Phil was upstairs adorning herself for a party
I suppose you feel kind of sorry said Aunt Jamesina
The teens are such a nice part of life
Im glad Ive never gone out of them myself
Anne laughed
You never will Aunty
Youll be eighteen when you should be a hundred
Yes Im sorry and a little dissatisfied as well
Miss Stacy told me long ago that by the time I was twenty my character would be formed for good or evil
I dont feel that its what it should be
Its full of flaws
Sos everybodys said Aunt Jamesina cheerfully
Mines cracked in a hundred places
Your Miss Stacy likely meant that when you are twenty your character would have got its permanent bent in one direction or tother and would go on developing in that line
Dont worry over it Anne
Do your duty by God and your neighbor and yourself and have a good time
Thats my philosophy and its always worked pretty well
Wheres Phil off to tonight
Shes going to a dance and shes got the sweetest dress for it  creamy yellow silk and cobwebby lace
It just suits those brown tints of hers
Theres magic in the words silk and lace isnt there
said Aunt Jamesina
The very sound of them makes me feel like skipping off to a dance
And YELLOW silk
It makes one think of a dress of sunshine
I always wanted a yellow silk dress but first my mother and then my husband wouldnt hear of it
The very first thing Im going to do when I get to heaven is to get a yellow silk dress
Amid Annes peal of laughter Phil came downstairs trailing clouds of glory and surveyed herself in the long oval mirror on the wall
A flattering looking glass is a promoter of amiability she said
The one in my room does certainly make me green
Do I look pretty nice Anne
Do you really know how pretty you are Phil
asked Anne in honest admiration
Of course I do
What are looking glasses and men for
That wasnt what I meant
Are all my ends tucked in
Is my skirt straight
And would this rose look better lower down
Im afraid its too high  it will make me look lopsided
But I hate things tickling my ears
Everything is just right and that southwest dimple of yours is lovely
Anne theres one thing in particular I like about you  youre so ungrudging
There isnt a particle of envy in you
Why should she be envious
demanded Aunt Jamesina
Shes not quite as goodlooking as you maybe but shes got a far handsomer nose
I know it conceded Phil
My nose always has been a great comfort to me confessed Anne
And I love the way your hair grows on your forehead Anne
And that one wee curl always looking as if it were going to drop but never dropping is delicious
But as for noses mine is a dreadful worry to me
I know by the time Im forty it will be Byrney
What do you think Ill look like when Im forty Anne
Like an old matronly married woman teased Anne
I wont said Phil sitting down comfortably to wait for her escort
Joseph you calico beastie dont you dare jump on my lap
I wont go to a dance all over cat hairs
No Anne I WONT look matronly
But no doubt Ill be married
To Alec or Alonzo
asked Anne
To one of them I suppose sighed Phil if I can ever decide which
It shouldnt be hard to decide scolded Aunt Jamesina
I was born a seesaw Aunty and nothing can ever prevent me from teetering
You ought to be more levelheaded Philippa
Its best to be levelheaded of course agreed Philippa but you miss lots of fun
As for Alec and Alonzo if you knew them youd understand why its difficult to choose between them
Theyre equally nice
Then take somebody who is nicer suggested Aunt Jamesina
Theres that Senior who is so devoted to you  Will Leslie
He has such nice large mild eyes
Theyre a little bit too large and too mild  like a cows said Phil cruelly
What do you say about George Parker
Theres nothing to say about him except that he always looks as if he had just been starched and ironed
Marr Holworthy then
You cant find a fault with him
No he would do if he wasnt poor
I must marry a rich man Aunt Jamesina
That  and good looks  is an indispensable qualification
Id marry Gilbert Blythe if he were rich
Oh would you
said Anne rather viciously
We dont like that idea a little bit although we dont want Gilbert ourselves oh no mocked Phil
But dont lets talk of disagreeable subjects
Ill have to marry sometime I suppose but I shall put off the evil day as long as I can
You mustnt marry anybody you dont love Phil when alls said and done said Aunt Jamesina
Oh hearts that loved in the good old way Have been out o the fashion this many a day
trilled Phil mockingly
Theres the carriage
I fly  Bibi you two oldfashioned darlings
When Phil had gone Aunt Jamesina looked solemnly at Anne
That girl is pretty and sweet and goodhearted but do you think she is quite right in her mind by spells Anne
Oh I dont think theres anything the matter with Phils mind said Anne hiding a smile
Its just her way of talking
Aunt Jamesina shook her head
Well I hope so Anne
I do hope so because I love her
But I cant understand her  she beats me
She isnt like any of the girls I ever knew or any of the girls I was myself
How many girls were you Aunt Jimsie
About half a dozen my dear
Chapter XX Gilbert Speaks This has been a dull prosy day yawned Phil stretching herself idly on the sofa having previously dispossessed two exceedingly indignant cats
Anne looked up from Pickwick Papers
Now that spring examinations were over she was treating herself to Dickens
It has been a prosy day for us she said thoughtfully but to some people it has been a wonderful day
Some one has been rapturously happy in it
Perhaps a great deed has been done somewhere today  or a great poem written  or a great man born
And some heart has been broken Phil
Why did you spoil your pretty thought by tagging that last sentence on honey
grumbled Phil
I dont like to think of broken hearts  or anything unpleasant
Do you think youll be able to shirk unpleasant things all your life Phil
Dear me no
Am I not up against them now
You dont call Alec and Alonzo pleasant things do you when they simply plague my life out
You never take anything seriously Phil
Why should I
There are enough folks who do
The world needs people like me Anne just to amuse it
It would be a terrible place if EVERYBODY were intellectual and serious and in deep deadly earnest
MY mission is as Josiah Allen says to charm and allure
Confess now
Hasnt life at Pattys Place been really much brighter and pleasanter this past winter because Ive been here to leaven you
Yes it has owned Anne
And you all love me  even Aunt Jamesina who thinks Im stark mad
So why should I try to be different
Oh dear Im so sleepy
I was awake until one last night reading a harrowing ghost story
I read it in bed and after I had finished it do you suppose I could get out of bed to put the light out
No
And if Stella had not fortunately come in late that lamp would have burned good and bright till morning
When I heard Stella I called her in explained my predicament and got her to put out the light
If I had got out myself to do it I knew something would grab me by the feet when I was getting in again
By the way Anne has Aunt Jamesina decided what to do this summer
Yes shes going to stay here
I know shes doing it for the sake of those blessed cats although she says its too much trouble to open her own house and she hates visiting
What are you reading
Pickwick
Thats a book that always makes me hungry said Phil
Theres so much good eating in it
The characters seem always to be reveling on ham and eggs and milk punch
I generally go on a cupboard rummage after reading Pickwick
The mere thought reminds me that Im starving
Is there any tidbit in the pantry Queen Anne
I made a lemon pie this morning
You may have a piece of it
Phil dashed out to the pantry and Anne betook herself to the orchard in company with Rusty
It was a moist pleasantly odorous night in early spring
The snow was not quite all gone from the park a little dingy bank of it yet lay under the pines of the harbor road screened from the influence of April suns
It kept the harbor road muddy and chilled the evening air
But grass was growing green in sheltered spots and Gilbert had found some pale sweet arbutus in a hidden corner
He came up from the park his hands full of it
Anne was sitting on the big gray boulder in the orchard looking at the poem of a bare birchen bough hanging against the pale red sunset with the very perfection of grace
She was building a castle in air  a wondrous mansion whose sunlit courts and stately halls were steeped in Arabys perfume and where she reigned queen and chatelaine
She frowned as she saw Gilbert coming through the orchard
Of late she had managed not to be left alone with Gilbert
But he had caught her fairly now and even Rusty had deserted her
Gilbert sat down beside her on the boulder and held out his Mayflowers
Dont these remind you of home and our old schoolday picnics Anne
Anne took them and buried her face in them
Im in Mr Silas Sloanes barrens this very minute she said rapturously
I suppose you will be there in reality in a few days
No not for a fortnight
Im going to visit with Phil in Bolingbroke before I go home
Youll be in Avonlea before I will
No I shall not be in Avonlea at all this summer Anne
Ive been offered a job in the Daily News office and Im going to take it
Oh said Anne vaguely
She wondered what a whole Avonlea summer would be like without Gilbert
Somehow she did not like the prospect
Well she concluded flatly it is a good thing for you of course
Yes Ive been hoping I would get it
It will help me out next year
You mustnt work too HARD said Anne without any very clear idea of what she was saying
She wished desperately that Phil would come out
Youve studied very constantly this winter
Isnt this a delightful evening
Do you know I found a cluster of white violets under that old twisted tree over there today
I felt as if I had discovered a gold mine
You are always discovering gold mines said Gilbert  also absently
Let us go and see if we can find some more suggested Anne eagerly
Ill call Phil and   Never mind Phil and the violets just now Anne said Gilbert quietly taking her hand in a clasp from which she could not free it
There is something I want to say to you
Oh dont say it cried Anne pleadingly
Dont  PLEASE Gilbert
I must
Things cant go on like this any longer
Anne I love you
You know I do
I  I cant tell you how much
Will you promise me that some day youll be my wife
I  I cant said Anne miserably
Oh Gilbert  you  youve spoiled everything
Dont you care for me at all
Gilbert asked after a very dreadful pause during which Anne had not dared to look up
Not  not in that way
I do care a great deal for you as a friend
But I dont love you Gilbert
But cant you give me some hope that you will  yet
No I cant exclaimed Anne desperately
I never never can love you  in that way  Gilbert
You must never speak of this to me again
There was another pause  so long and so dreadful that Anne was driven at last to look up
Gilberts face was white to the lips
And his eyes  but Anne shuddered and looked away
There was nothing romantic about this
Must proposals be either grotesque or  horrible
Could she ever forget Gilberts face
Is there anybody else
he asked at last in a low voice
No  no said Anne eagerly
I dont care for any one like THAT  and I LIKE you better than anybody else in the world Gilbert
And we must  we must go on being friends Gilbert
Gilbert gave a bitter little laugh
Friends
Your friendship cant satisfy me Anne
I want your love  and you tell me I can never have that
Im sorry
Forgive me Gilbert was all Anne could say
Where oh where were all the gracious and graceful speeches wherewith in imagination she had been wont to dismiss rejected suitors
Gilbert released her hand gently
There isnt anything to forgive
There have been times when I thought you did care
Ive deceived myself thats all
Goodbye Anne
Anne got herself to her room sat down on her window seat behind the pines and cried bitterly
She felt as if something incalculably precious had gone out of her life
It was Gilberts friendship of course
Oh why must she lose it after this fashion
What is the matter honey
asked Phil coming in through the moonlit gloom
Anne did not answer
At that moment she wished Phil were a thousand miles away
I suppose youve gone and refused Gilbert Blythe
You are an idiot Anne Shirley
Do you call it idiotic to refuse to marry a man I dont love
said Anne coldly goaded to reply
You dont know love when you see it
Youve tricked something out with your imagination that you think love and you expect the real thing to look like that
There thats the first sensible thing Ive ever said in my life
I wonder how I managed it
Phil pleaded Anne please go away and leave me alone for a little while
My world has tumbled into pieces
I want to reconstruct it
Without any Gilbert in it
said Phil going
A world without any Gilbert in it
Anne repeated the words drearily
Would it not be a very lonely forlorn place
Well it was all Gilberts fault
He had spoiled their beautiful comradeship
She must just learn to live without it
Chapter XXI Roses of Yesterday The fortnight Anne spent in Bolingbroke was a very pleasant one with a little under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction running through it whenever she thought about Gilbert
There was not however much time to think about him
Mount Holly the beautiful old Gordon homestead was a very gay place overrun by Phils friends of both sexes
There was quite a bewildering succession of drives dances picnics and boating parties all expressively lumped together by Phil under the head of jamborees Alec and Alonzo were so constantly on hand that Anne wondered if they ever did anything but dance attendance on that willothewisp of a Phil
They were both nice manly fellows but Anne would not be drawn into any opinion as to which was the nicer
And I depended so on you to help me make up my mind which of them I should promise to marry mourned Phil
You must do that for yourself
You are quite expert at making up your mind as to whom other people should marry retorted Anne rather caustically
Oh thats a very different thing said Phil truly
But the sweetest incident of Annes sojourn in Bolingbroke was the visit to her birthplace  the little shabby yellow house in an outoftheway street she had so often dreamed about
She looked at it with delighted eyes as she and Phil turned in at the gate
Its almost exactly as Ive pictured it she said
There is no honeysuckle over the windows but there is a lilac tree by the gate and  yes there are the muslin curtains in the windows
How glad I am it is still painted yellow
A very tall very thin woman opened the door
Yes the Shirleys lived here twenty years ago she said in answer to Annes question
They had it rented
I remember em
They both died of fever at onct
It was turrible sad
They left a baby
I guess its dead long ago
It was a sickly thing
Old Thomas and his wife took it  as if they hadnt enough of their own
It didnt die said Anne smiling
I was that baby
You dont say so
Why you have grown exclaimed the woman as if she were much surprised that Anne was not still a baby
Come to look at you I see the resemblance
Youre complected like your pa
He had red hair
But you favor your ma in your eyes and mouth
She was a nice little thing
My darter went to school to her and was nigh crazy about her
They was buried in the one grave and the School Board put up a tombstone to them as a reward for faithful service
Will you come in
Will you let me go all over the house
asked Anne eagerly
Laws yes you can if you like
Twont take you long  there aint much of it
I keep at my man to build a new kitchen but he aint one of your hustlers
The parlors in there and theres two rooms upstairs
Just prowl about yourselves
Ive got to see to the baby
The east room was the one you were born in
I remember your ma saying she loved to see the sunrise and I mind hearing that you was born just as the sun was rising and its light on your face was the first thing your ma saw
Anne went up the narrow stairs and into that little east room with a full heart
It was as a shrine to her
Here her mother had dreamed the exquisite happy dreams of anticipated motherhood here that red sunrise light had fallen over them both in the sacred hour of birth here her mother had died
Anne looked about her reverently her eyes with tears
It was for her one of the jeweled hours of life that gleam out radiantly forever in memory
Just to think of it  mother was younger than I am now when I was born she whispered
When Anne went downstairs the lady of the house met her in the hall
She held out a dusty little packet tied with faded blue ribbon
Heres a bundle of old letters I found in that closet upstairs when I came here she said
I dunno what they are  I never bothered to look in em but the address on the top one is Miss Bertha Willis and that was your mas maiden name
You can take em if youd keer to have em
Oh thank you  thank you cried Anne clasping the packet rapturously
That was all that was in the house said her hostess
The furniture was all sold to pay the doctor bills and Mrs Thomas got your mas clothes and little things
I reckon they didnt last long among that drove of Thomas youngsters
They was destructive young animals as I mind em
I havent one thing that belonged to my mother said Anne chokily
I  I can never thank you enough for these letters
Youre quite welcome
Laws but your eyes is like your mas
She could just about talk with hers
Your father was sorter homely but awful nice
I mind hearing folks say when they was married that there never was two people more in love with each other  Pore creatures they didnt live much longer but they was awful happy while they was alive and I spose that counts for a good deal
Anne longed to get home to read her precious letters but she made one little pilgrimage first
She went alone to the green corner of the old Bolingbroke cemetery where her father and mother were buried and left on their grave the white flowers she carried
Then she hastened back to Mount Holly shut herself up in her room and read the letters
Some were written by her father some by her mother
There were not many  only a dozen in all  for Walter and Bertha Shirley had not been often separated during their courtship
The letters were yellow and faded and dim blurred with the touch of passing years
No profound words of wisdom were traced on the stained and wrinkled pages but only lines of love and trust
The sweetness of forgotten things clung to them  the faroff fond imaginings of those longdead lovers
Bertha Shirley had possessed the gift of writing letters which embodied the charming personality of the writer in words and thoughts that retained their beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time
The letters were tender intimate sacred
To Anne the sweetest of all was the one written after her birth to the father on a brief absence
It was full of a proud young mothers accounts of baby  her cleverness her brightness her thousand sweetnesses
I love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is awake Bertha Shirley had written in the postscript
Probably it was the last sentence she had ever penned
The end was very near for her
This has been the most beautiful day of my life Anne said to Phil that night
Ive FOUND my father and mother
Those letters have made them REAL to me
Im not an orphan any longer
I feel as if I had opened a book and found roses of yesterday sweet and beloved between its leaves
Chapter XXII Spring and Anne Return to Green Gables The firelight shadows were dancing over the kitchen walls at Green Gables for the spring evening was chilly through the open east window drifted in the subtly sweet voices of the night
Marilla was sitting by the fire  at least in body
In spirit she was roaming olden ways with feet grown young
Of late Marilla had thus spent many an hour when she thought she should have been knitting for the twins
I suppose Im growing old she said
Yet Marilla had changed but little in the past nine years save to grow something thinner and even more angular there was a little more gray in the hair that was still twisted up in the same hard knot with two hairpins  WERE they the same hairpins
 still stuck through it
But her expression was very different the something about the mouth which had hinted at a sense of humor had developed wonderfully her eyes were gentler and milder her smile more frequent and tender
Marilla was thinking of her whole past life her cramped but not unhappy childhood the jealously hidden dreams and the blighted hopes of her girlhood the long gray narrow monotonous years of dull middle life that followed
And the coming of Anne  the vivid imaginative impetuous child with her heart of love and her world of fancy bringing with her color and warmth and radiance until the wilderness of existence had blossomed like the rose
Marilla felt that out of her sixty years she had lived only the nine that had followed the advent of Anne
And Anne would be home tomorrow night
The kitchen door opened
Marilla looked up expecting to see Mrs Lynde
Anne stood before her tall and starryeyed with her hands full of Mayflowers and violets
Anne Shirley
exclaimed Marilla
For once in her life she was surprised out of her reserve she caught her girl in her arms and crushed her and her flowers against her heart kissing the bright hair and sweet face warmly
I never looked for you till tomorrow night
How did you get from Carmody
Walked dearest of Marillas
Havent I done it a score of times in the Queens days
The mailman is to bring my trunk tomorrow I just got homesick all at once and came a day earlier
And oh
Ive had such a lovely walk in the May twilight I stopped by the barrens and picked these Mayflowers I came through VioletVale its just a big bowlful of violets now  the dear skytinted things
Smell them Marilla  drink them in
Marilla sniffed obligingly but she was more interested in Anne than in drinking violets
Sit down child
You must be real tired
Im going to get you some supper
Theres a darling moonrise behind the hills tonight Marilla and oh how the frogs sang me home from Carmody
I do love the music of the frogs
It seems bound up with all my happiest recollections of old spring evenings
And it always reminds me of the night I came here first
Do you remember it Marilla
Well yes said Marilla with emphasis
Im not likely to forget it ever
They used to sing so madly in the marsh and brook that year
I would listen to them at my window in the dusk and wonder how they could seem so glad and so sad at the same time
Oh but its good to be home again
Redmond was splendid and Bolingbroke delightful  but Green Gables is HOME
Gilbert isnt coming home this summer I hear said Marilla
No
Something in Annes tone made Marilla glance at her sharply but Anne was apparently absorbed in arranging her violets in a bowl
See arent they sweet
she went on hurriedly
The year is a book isnt it Marilla
Springs pages are written in Mayflowers and violets summers in roses autumns in red maple leaves and winter in holly and evergreen
Did Gilbert do well in his examinations
persisted Marilla
Excellently well
He led his class
But where are the twins and Mrs
Lynde
Rachel and Dora are over at Mr Harrisons
Davy is down at Boulters
I think I hear him coming now
Davy burst in saw Anne stopped and then hurled himself upon her with a joyful yell
Oh Anne aint I glad to see you
Say Anne Ive grown two inches since last fall
Mrs Lynde measured me with her tape today and say Anne see my front tooth
Its gone
Mrs Lynde tied one end of a string to it and the other end to the door and then shut the door
I sold it to Milty for two cents
Miltys collecting teeth
What in the world does he want teeth for
asked Marilla
To make a necklace for playing Indian Chief explained Davy climbing upon Annes lap
Hes got fifteen already and everybodys elses promised so theres no use in the rest of us starting to collect too
I tell you the Boulters are great business people
Were you a good boy at Mrs
Boulters
asked Marilla severely
Yes but say Marilla Im tired of being good
Youd get tired of being bad much sooner Davyboy said Anne
Well itd be fun while it lasted wouldnt it
persisted Davy
I could be sorry for it afterwards couldnt I
Being sorry wouldnt do away with the consequences of being bad Davy
Dont you remember the Sunday last summer when you ran away from Sunday School
You told me then that being bad wasnt worth while
What were you and Milty doing today
Oh we fished and chased the cat and hunted for eggs and yelled at the echo
Theres a great echo in the bush behind the Boulter barn
Say what is echo Anne I want to know
Echo is a beautiful nymph Davy living far away in the woods and laughing at the world from among the hills
What does she look like
Her hair and eyes are dark but her neck and arms are white as snow
No mortal can ever see how fair she is
She is fleeter than a deer and that mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her
You can hear her calling at night you can hear her laughing under the stars
But you can never see her
She flies afar if you follow her and laughs at you always just over the next hill
Is that true Anne
Or is it a whopper
demanded Davy staring
Davy said Anne despairingly havent you sense enough to distinguish between a fairytale and a falsehood
Then what is it that sasses back from the Boulter bush
I want to know insisted Davy
When you are a little older Davy Ill explain it all to you
The mention of age evidently gave a new turn to Davys thoughts for after a few moments of reflection he whispered solemnly Anne Im going to be married
When
asked Anne with equal solemnity
Oh not until Im grownup of course
Well thats a relief Davy
Who is the lady
Stella Fletcher shes in my class at school
And say Anne shes the prettiest girl you ever saw
If I die before I grow up youll keep an eye on her wont you
Davy Keith do stop talking such nonsense said Marilla severely 
Tisnt nonsense protested Davy in an injured tone
Shes my promised wife and if I was to die shed be my promised widow wouldnt she
And she hasnt got a soul to look after her except her old grandmother
Come and have your supper Anne said Marilla and dont encourage that child in his absurd talk
Chapter XXIII Paul Cannot Find the Rock People Life was very pleasant in Avonlea that summer although Anne amid all her vacation joys was haunted by a sense of something gone which should be there
She would not admit even in her inmost reflections that this was caused by Gilberts absence
But when she had to walk home alone from prayer meetings and AVIS
powwows while Diana and Fred and many other gay couples loitered along the dusky starlit country roads there was a queer lonely ache in her heart which she could not explain away
Gilbert did not even write to her as she thought he might have done
She knew he wrote to Diana occasionally but she would not inquire about him and Diana supposing that Anne heard from him volunteered no information
Gilberts mother who was a gay frank lighthearted lady but not overburdened with tact had a very embarrassing habit of asking Anne always in a painfully distinct voice and always in the presence of a crowd if she had heard from Gilbert lately
Poor Anne could only blush horribly and murmur not very lately which was taken by all Mrs Blythe included to be merely a maidenly evasion
Apart from this Anne enjoyed her summer
Priscilla came for a merry visit in June and when she had gone Mr and Mrs Irving Paul and Charlotta the Fourth came home for July and August
Echo Lodge was the scene of gaieties once more and the echoes over the river were kept busy mimicking the laughter that rang in the old garden behind the spruces
Miss Lavendar had not changed except to grow even sweeter and prettier
Paul adored her and the companionship between them was beautiful to see
But I dont call her mother just by itself he explained to Anne
You see THAT name belongs just to my own little mother and I cant give it to any one else
You know teacher
But I call her Mother Lavendar and I love her next best to father
I  I even love her a LITTLE better than you teacher
Which is just as it ought to be answered Anne
Paul was thirteen now and very tall for his years
His face and eyes were as beautiful as ever and his fancy was still like a prism separating everything that fell upon it into rainbows
He and Anne had delightful rambles to wood and field and shore
Never were there two more thoroughly kindred spirits
Charlotta the Fourth had blossomed out into young ladyhood
She wore her hair now in an enormous pompador and had discarded the blue ribbon bows of auld lang syne but her face was as freckled her nose as snubbed and her mouth and smiles as wide as ever
You dont think I talk with a Yankee accent do you Miss Shirley maam
she demanded anxiously
I dont notice it Charlotta
Im real glad of that
They said I did at home but I thought likely they just wanted to aggravate me
I dont want no Yankee accent
Not that Ive a word to say against the Yankees Miss Shirley maam
Theyre real civilized
But give me old PE
Island every time
Paul spent his first fortnight with his grandmother Irving in Avonlea
Anne was there to meet him when he came and found him wild with eagerness to get to the shore  Nora and the Golden Lady and the Twin Sailors would be there
He could hardly wait to eat his supper
Could he not see Noras elfin face peering around the point watching for him wistfully
But it was a very sober Paul who came back from the shore in the twilight
Didnt you find your Rock People
asked Anne
Paul shook his chestnut curls sorrowfully
The Twin Sailors and the Golden Lady never came at all he said
Nora was there  but Nora is not the same teacher
She is changed
Oh Paul it is you who are changed said Anne
You have grown too old for the Rock People
They like only children for playfellows
I am afraid the Twin Sailors will never again come to you in the pearly enchanted boat with the sail of moonshine and the Golden Lady will play no more for you on her golden harp
Even Nora will not meet you much longer
You must pay the penalty of growingup Paul
You must leave fairyland behind you
You two talk as much foolishness as ever you did said old Mrs Irving halfindulgently halfreprovingly
Oh no we dont said Anne shaking her head gravely
We are getting very very wise and it is such a pity
We are never half so interesting when we have learned that language is given us to enable us to conceal our thoughts
But it isnt  it is given us to exchange our thoughts said Mrs Irving seriously
She had never heard of Tallyrand and did not understand epigrams
Anne spent a fortnight of halcyon days at Echo Lodge in the golden prime of August
While there she incidentally contrived to hurry Ludovic Speed in his leisurely courting of Theodora Dix as related duly in another chronicle of her history
1 Arnold Sherman an elderly friend of the Irvings was there at the same time and added not a little to the general pleasantness of life
1 Chronicles of Avonlea
What a nice playtime this has been said Anne
I feel like a giant refreshed
And its only a fortnight more till I go back to Kingsport and Redmond and Pattys Place
Pattys Place is the dearest spot Miss Lavendar
I feel as if I had two homes  one at Green Gables and one at Pattys Place
But where has the summer gone
It doesnt seem a day since I came home that spring evening with the Mayflowers
When I was little I couldnt see from one end of the summer to the other
It stretched before me like an unending season
Now tis a handbreadth tis a tale
Anne are you and Gilbert Blythe as good friends as you used to be
asked Miss Lavendar quietly
I am just as much Gilberts friend as ever I was Miss Lavendar
Miss Lavendar shook her head
I see somethings gone wrong Anne
Im going to be impertinent and ask what
Have you quarrelled
No its only that Gilbert wants more than friendship and I cant give him more
Are you sure of that Anne
Perfectly sure
Im very very sorry
I wonder why everybody seems to think I ought to marry Gilbert Blythe said Anne petulantly
Because you were made and meant for each other Anne  that is why
You neednt toss that young head of yours
Its a fact
Chapter XXIV Enter Jonas PROSPECT POINT August 20th
Dear Anne  spelled  with  an  E wrote Phil I must prop my eyelids open long enough to write you
Ive neglected you shamefully this summer honey but all my other correspondents have been neglected too
I have a huge pile of letters to answer so I must gird up the loins of my mind and hoe in
Excuse my mixed metaphors
Im fearfully sleepy
Last night Cousin Emily and I were calling at a neighbors
There were several other callers there and as soon as those unfortunate creatures left our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces
I knew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us
When we came home Mrs Lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbors hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever
You can always trust Mrs Lilly to tell you cheerful things like that
I have a horror of scarlet fever
I couldnt sleep when I went to bed for thinking of it
I tossed and tumbled about dreaming fearful dreams when I did snooze for a minute and at three I wakened up with a high fever a sore throat and a raging headache
I knew I had scarlet fever I got up in a panic and hunted up Cousin Emilys doctor book to read up the symptoms
Anne I had them all
So I went back to bed and knowing the worst slept like a top the rest of the night
Though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could understand
But this morning I was quite well so it couldnt have been the fever
I suppose if I did catch it last night it couldnt have developed so soon
I can remember that in daytime but at three oclock at night I never can be logical
I suppose you wonder what Im doing at Prospect Point
Well I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore and father insists that I come to his secondcousin Emilys select boardinghouse at Prospect Point
So a fortnight ago I came as usual
And as usual old Uncle Mark Miller brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his generous purpose horse
He is a nice old man and gave me a handful of pink peppermints
Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy  I suppose because when I was a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church
Once I asked referring to the smell of peppermints Is that the odor of sanctity
I didnt like to eat Uncle Marks peppermints because he just fished them loose out of his pocket and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me
But I wouldnt hurt his dear old feelings for anything so I carefully sowed them along the road at intervals
When the last one was gone Uncle Mark said a little rebukingly Ye shouldnt aet all them candies to onct Miss Phil
Youll likely have the stummickache
Cousin Emily has only five boarders besides myself  four old ladies and one young man
My righthand neighbor is Mrs Lilly
She is one of those people who seem to take a gruesome pleasure in detailing all their many aches and pains and sicknesses
You cannot mention any ailment but she says shaking her head Ah I know too well what that is  and then you get all the details
Jonas declares he once spoke of locomotor ataxia in hearing and she said she knew too well what that was
She suffered from it for ten years and was finally cured by a traveling doctor
Who is Jonas
Just wait Anne Shirley
Youll hear all about Jonas in the proper time and place
He is not to be mixed up with estimable old ladies
My lefthand neighbor at the table is Mrs Phinney
She always speaks with a wailing dolorous voice  you are nervously expecting her to burst into tears every moment
She gives you the impression that life to her is indeed a vale of tears and that a smile never to speak of a laugh is a frivolity truly reprehensible
She has a worse opinion of me than Aunt Jamesina and she doesnt love me hard to atone for it as Aunty J does either
Miss Maria Grimsby sits caticorner from me
The first day I came I remarked to Miss Maria that it looked a little like rain  and Miss Maria laughed
I said the road from the station was very pretty  and Miss Maria laughed
I said there seemed to be a few mosquitoes left yet  and Miss Maria laughed
I said that Prospect Point was as beautiful as ever  and Miss Maria laughed
If I were to say to Miss Maria My father has hanged himself my mother has taken poison my brother is in the penitentiary and I am in the last stages of consumption Miss Maria would laugh
She cant help it  she was born so but is very sad and awful
The fifth old lady is Mrs Grant
She is a sweet old thing but she never says anything but good of anybody and so she is a very uninteresting conversationalist
And now for Jonas Anne
That first day I came I saw a young man sitting opposite me at the table smiling at me as if he had known me from my cradle
I knew for Uncle Mark had told me that his name was Jonas Blake that he was a Theological Student from St Columbia and that he had taken charge of the Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer
He is a very ugly young man  really the ugliest young man Ive ever seen
He has a big loosejointed figure with absurdly long legs
His hair is towcolor and lank his eyes are green and his mouth is big and his ears  but I never think about his ears if I can help it
He has a lovely voice  if you shut your eyes he is adorable  and he certainly has a beautiful soul and disposition
We were good chums right way
Of course he is a graduate of Redmond and that is a link between us
We fished and boated together and we walked on the sands by moonlight
He didnt look so homely by moonlight and oh he was nice
Niceness fairly exhaled from him
The old ladies  except Mrs Grant  dont approve of Jonas because he laughs and jokes  and because he evidently likes the society of frivolous me better than theirs
Somehow Anne I dont want him to think me frivolous
This is ridiculous
Why should I care what a towhaired person called Jonas whom I never saw before thinks of me
Last Sunday Jonas preached in the village church
I went of course but I couldnt realize that Jonas was going to preach
The fact that he was a minister  or going to be one  persisted in seeming a huge joke to me
Well Jonas preached
And by the time he had preached ten minutes I felt so small and insignificant that I thought I must be invisible to the naked eye
Jonas never said a word about women and he never looked at me
But I realized then and there what a pitiful frivilous smallsouled little butterfly I was and how horribly different I must be from Jonas ideal woman
SHE would be grand and strong and noble
He was so earnest and tender and true
He was everything a minister ought to be
I wondered how I could ever have thought him ugly  but he really is
 with those inspired eyes and that intellectual brow which the roughlyfalling hair hid on week days
It was a splendid sermon and I could have listened to it forever and it made me feel utterly wretched
Oh I wish I was like YOU Anne
He caught up with me on the road home and grinned as cheerfully as usual
But his grin could never deceive me again
I had seen the REAL Jonas
I wondered if he could ever see the REAL PHIL  whom NOBODY not even you Anne has ever seen yet
Jonas I said  I forgot to call him Mr Blake
Wasnt it dreadful
But there are times when things like that dont matter  Jonas you were born to be a minister
You COULDNT be anything else
No I couldnt he said soberly
I tried to be something else for a long time  I didnt want to be a minister
But I came to see at last that it was the work given me to do  and God helping me I shall try to do it
His voice was low and reverent
I thought that he would do his work and do it well and nobly and happy the woman fitted by nature and training to help him do it
SHE would be no feather blown about by every fickle wind of fancy
SHE would always know what hat to put on
Probably she would have only one
Ministers never have much money
But she wouldnt mind having one hat or none at all because she would have Jonas
Anne Shirley dont you dare to say or hint or think that Ive fallen in love with Mr Blake
Could I care for a lank poor ugly theologue  named Jonas
As Uncle Mark says Its impossible and whats more its improbable
Good night PHIL
PS
It is impossible  but I am horribly afraid its true
Im happy and wretched and scared
HE can NEVER care for me I know
Do you think I could ever develop into a passable ministers wife Anne
And WOULD they expect me to lead in prayer
P G Chapter XXV Enter Prince Charming Im contrasting the claims of indoors and out said Anne looking from the window of Pattys Place to the distant pines of the park
Ive an afternoon to spend in sweet doing nothing Aunt Jimsie
Shall I spend it here where there is a cosy fire a plateful of delicious russets three purring and harmonious cats and two impeccable china dogs with green noses
Or shall I go to the park where there is the lure of gray woods and of gray water lapping on the harbor rocks
If I was as young as you Id decide in favor of the park said Aunt Jamesina tickling Josephs yellow ear with a knitting needle
I thought that you claimed to be as young as any of us Aunty teased Anne
Yes in my soul
But Ill admit my legs arent as young as yours
You go and get some fresh air Anne
You look pale lately
I think Ill go to the park said Anne restlessly
I dont feel like tame domestic joys today
I want to feel alone and free and wild
The park will be empty for every one will be at the football match
Why didnt you go to it
Nobody axed me sir she said  at least nobody but that horrid little Dan Ranger
I wouldnt go anywhere with him but rather than hurt his poor little tender feelings I said I wasnt going to the game at all
I dont mind
Im not in the mood for football today somehow
You go and get some fresh air repeated Aunt Jamesina but take your umbrella for I believe its going to rain
Ive rheumatism in my leg
Only old people should have rheumatism Aunty
Anybody is liable to rheumatism in her legs Anne
Its only old people who should have rheumatism in their souls though
Thank goodness I never have
When you get rheumatism in your soul you might as well go and pick out your coffin
It was November  the month of crimson sunsets parting birds deep sad hymns of the sea passionate windsongs in the pines
Anne roamed through the pineland alleys in the park and as she said let that great sweeping wind blow the fogs out of her soul
Anne was not wont to be troubled with soul fog
But somehow since her return to Redmond for this third year life had not mirrored her spirit back to her with its old perfect sparkling clearness
Outwardly existence at Pattys Place was the same pleasant round of work and study and recreation that it had always been
On Friday evenings the big firelighted livingroom was crowded by callers and echoed to endless jest and laughter while Aunt Jamesina smiled beamingly on them all
The Jonas of Phils letter came often running up from St Columbia on the early train and departing on the late
He was a general favorite at Pattys Place though Aunt Jamesina shook her head and opined that divinity students were not what they used to be
Hes VERY nice my dear she told Phil but ministers ought to be graver and more dignified
Cant a man laugh and laugh and be a Christian still
demanded Phil
Oh MEN  yes
But I was speaking of MINISTERS my dear said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly
And you shouldnt flirt so with Mr Blake  you really shouldnt
Im not flirting with him protested Phil
Nobody believed her except Anne
The others thought she was amusing herself as usual and told her roundly that she was behaving very badly
Mr Blake isnt of the AlecandAlonzo type Phil said Stella severely
He takes things seriously
You may break his heart
Do you really think I could
asked Phil
Id love to think so
Philippa Gordon
I never thought you were utterly unfeeling
The idea of you saying youd love to break a mans heart
I didnt say so honey
Quote me correctly
I said Id like to think I COULD break it
I would like to know I had the POWER to do it
I dont understand you Phil
You are leading that man on deliberately  and you know you dont mean anything by it
I mean to make him ask me to marry him if I can said Phil calmly
I give you up said Stella hopelessly
Gilbert came occasionally on Friday evenings
He seemed always in good spirits and held his own in the jests and repartee that flew about
He neither sought nor avoided Anne
When circumstances brought them in contact he talked to her pleasantly and courteously as to any newlymade acquaintance
The old camaraderie was gone entirely
Anne felt it keenly but she told herself she was very glad and thankful that Gilbert had got so completely over his disappointment in regard to her
She had really been afraid that April evening in the orchard that she had hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in healing
Now she saw that she need not have worried
Men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love
Gilbert evidently was in no danger of immediate dissolution
He was enjoying life and he was full of ambition and zest
For him there was to be no wasting in despair because a woman was fair and cold
Anne as she listened to the ceaseless badinage that went on between him and Phil wondered if she had only imagined that look in his eyes when she had told him she could never care for him
There were not lacking those who would gladly have stepped into Gilberts vacant place
But Anne snubbed them without fear and without reproach
If the real Prince Charming was never to come she would have none of a substitute
So she sternly told herself that gray day in the windy park
Suddenly the rain of Aunt Jamesinas prophecy came with a swish and rush
Anne put up her umbrella and hurried down the slope
As she turned out on the harbor road a savage gust of wind tore along it
Instantly her umbrella turned wrong side out
Anne clutched at it in despair
And then  there came a voice close to her
Pardon me  may I offer you the shelter of my umbrella
Anne looked up
Tall and handsome and distinguishedlooking  dark melancholy inscrutable eyes  melting musical sympathetic voice  yes the very hero of her dreams stood before her in the flesh
He could not have more closely resembled her ideal if he had been made to order
Thank you she said confusedly
Wed better hurry over to that little pavillion on the point suggested the unknown
We can wait there until this shower is over
It is not likely to rain so heavily very long
The words were very commonplace but oh the tone
And the smile which accompanied them
Anne felt her heart beating strangely
Together they scurried to the pavilion and sat breathlessly down under its friendly roof
Anne laughingly held up her false umbrella
It is when my umbrella turns inside out that I am convinced of the total depravity of inanimate things she said gaily
The raindrops sparkled on her shining hair its loosened rings curled around her neck and forehead
Her cheeks were flushed her eyes big and starry
Her companion looked down at her admiringly
She felt herself blushing under his gaze
Who could he be
Why there was a bit of the Redmond white and scarlet pinned to his coat lapel
Yet she had thought she knew by sight at least all the Redmond students except the Freshmen
And this courtly youth surely was no Freshman
We are schoolmates I see he said smiling at Annes colors
That ought to be sufficient introduction
My name is Royal Gardner
And you are the Miss Shirley who read the Tennyson paper at the Philomathic the other evening arent you
Yes but I cannot place you at all said Anne frankly
Please where DO you belong
I feel as if I didnt belong anywhere yet
I put in my Freshman and Sophomore years at Redmond two years ago
Ive been in Europe ever since
Now Ive come back to finish my Arts course
This is my Junior year too said Anne
So we are classmates as well as collegemates
I am reconciled to the loss of the years that the locust has eaten said her companion with a world of meaning in those wonderful eyes of his
The rain came steadily down for the best part of an hour
But the time seemed really very short
When the clouds parted and a burst of pale November sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pines Anne and her companion walked home together
By the time they had reached the gate of Pattys Place he had asked permission to call and had received it
Anne went in with cheeks of flame and her heart beating to her fingertips
Rusty who climbed into her lap and tried to kiss her found a very absent welcome
Anne with her soul full of romantic thrills had no attention to spare just then for a cropeared pussy cat
That evening a parcel was left at Pattys Place for Miss Shirley
It was a box containing a dozen magnificent roses
Phil pounced impertinently on the card that fell from it read the name and the poetical quotation written on the back
Royal Gardner
she exclaimed
Why Anne I didnt know you were acquainted with Roy Gardner
I met him in the park this afternoon in the rain explained Anne hurriedly
My umbrella turned inside out and he came to my rescue with his
Oh
Phil peered curiously at Anne
And is that exceedingly commonplace incident any reason why he should send us longstemmed roses by the dozen with a very sentimental rhyme
Or why we should blush divinest rosyred when we look at his card
Anne thy face betrayeth thee
Dont talk nonsense Phil
Do you know Mr
Gardner
Ive met his two sisters and I know of him
So does everybody worthwhile in Kingsport
The Gardners are among the richest bluest of Bluenoses
Roy is adorably handsome and clever
Two years ago his mothers health failed and he had to leave college and go abroad with her  his father is dead
He must have been greatly disappointed to have to give up his class but they say he was perfectly sweet about it
Fee  fi  fo  fum Anne
I smell romance
Almost do I envy you but not quite
After all Roy Gardner isnt Jonas
You goose
said Anne loftily
But she lay long awake that night nor did she wish for sleep
Her waking fancies were more alluring than any vision of dreamland
Had the real Prince come at last
Recalling those glorious dark eyes which had gazed so deeply into her own Anne was very strongly inclined to think he had
Chapter XXVI Enter Christine The girls at Pattys Place were dressing for the reception which the Juniors were giving for the Seniors in February
Anne surveyed herself in the mirror of the blue room with girlish satisfaction
She had a particularly pretty gown on
Originally it had been only a simple little slip of cream silk with a chiffon overdress
But Phil had insisted on taking it home with her in the Christmas holidays and embroidering tiny rosebuds all over the chiffon
Phils fingers were deft and the result was a dress which was the envy of every Redmond girl
Even Allie Boone whose frocks came from Paris was wont to look with longing eyes on that rosebud concoction as Anne trailed up the main staircase at Redmond in it
Anne was trying the effect of a white orchid in her hair
Roy Gardner had sent her white orchids for the reception and she knew no other Redmond girl would have them that night  when Phil came in with admiring gaze
Anne this is certainly your night for looking handsome
Nine nights out of ten I can easily outshine you
The tenth you blossom out suddenly into something that eclipses me altogether
How do you manage it
Its the dress dear
Fine feathers
Tisnt
The last evening you flamed out into beauty you wore your old blue flannel shirtwaist that Mrs Lynde made you
If Roy hadnt already lost head and heart about you he certainly would tonight
But I dont like orchids on you Anne
No it isnt jealousy
Orchids dont seem to BELONG to you
Theyre too exotic  too tropical  too insolent
Dont put them in your hair anyway
Well I wont
I admit Im not fond of orchids myself
I dont think theyre related to me
Roy doesnt often send them  he knows I like flowers I can live with
Orchids are only things you can visit with
Jonas sent me some dear pink rosebuds for the evening  but  he isnt coming himself
He said he had to lead a prayermeeting in the slums
I dont believe he wanted to come
Anne Im horribly afraid Jonas doesnt really care anything about me
And Im trying to decide whether Ill pine away and die or go on and get my BA
and be sensible and useful
You couldnt possibly be sensible and useful Phil so youd better pine away and die said Anne cruelly
Heartless Anne
Silly Phil
You know quite well that Jonas loves you
But  he wont TELL me so
And I cant MAKE him
He LOOKS it Ill admit
But speaktomeonlywiththineeyes isnt a really reliable reason for embroidering doilies and hemstitching tablecloths
I dont want to begin such work until Im really engaged
It would be tempting Fate
Mr Blake is afraid to ask you to marry him Phil
He is poor and cant offer you a home such as youve always had
You know that is the only reason he hasnt spoken long ago
I suppose so agreed Phil dolefully
Well  brightening up  if he WONT ask me to marry him Ill ask him thats all
So its bound to come right
I wont worry
By the way Gilbert Blythe is going about constantly with Christine Stuart
Did you know
Anne was trying to fasten a little gold chain about her throat
She suddenly found the clasp difficult to manage
WHAT was the matter with it  or with her fingers
No she said carelessly
Who is Christine Stuart
Ronald Stuarts sister
Shes in Kingsport this winter studying music
I havent seen her but they say shes very pretty and that Gilbert is quite crazy over her
How angry I was when you refused Gilbert Anne
But Roy Gardner was foreordained for you
I can see that now
You were right after all
Anne did not blush as she usually did when the girls assumed that her eventual marriage to Roy Gardner was a settled thing
All at once she felt rather dull
Phils chatter seemed trivial and the reception a bore
She boxed poor Rustys ears
Get off that cushion instantly you cat you
Why dont you stay down where you belong
Anne picked up her orchids and went downstairs where Aunt Jamesina was presiding over a row of coats hung before the fire to warm
Roy Gardner was waiting for Anne and teasing the Sarahcat while he waited
The Sarahcat did not approve of him
She always turned her back on him
But everybody else at Pattys Place liked him very much
Aunt Jamesina carried away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy and the pleading tones of his delightful voice declared he was the nicest young man she ever knew and that Anne was a very fortunate girl
Such remarks made Anne restive
Roys wooing had certainly been as romantic as girlish heart could desire but  she wished Aunt Jamesina and the girls would not take things so for granted
When Roy murmured a poetical compliment as he helped her on with her coat she did not blush and thrill as usual and he found her rather silent in their brief walk to Redmond
He thought she looked a little pale when she came out of the coeds dressing room but as they entered the reception room her color and sparkle suddenly returned to her
She turned to Roy with her gayest expression
He smiled back at her with what Phil called his deep black velvety smile
Yet she really did not see Roy at all
She was acutely conscious that Gilbert was standing under the palms just across the room talking to a girl who must be Christine Stuart
She was very handsome in the stately style destined to become rather massive in middle life
A tall girl with large darkblue eyes ivory outlines and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair
She looks just as Ive always wanted to look thought Anne miserably
Roseleaf complexion  starry violet eyes  raven hair  yes she has them all
Its a wonder her name isnt Cordelia Fitzgerald into the bargain
But I dont believe her figure is as good as mine and her nose certainly isnt
Anne felt a little comforted by this conclusion
Chapter XXVII Mutual Confidences March came in that winter like the meekest and mildest of lambs bringing days that were crisp and golden and tingling each followed by a frosty pink twilight which gradually lost itself in an elfland of moonshine
Over the girls at Pattys Place was falling the shadow of April examinations
They were studying hard even Phil had settled down to text and notebooks with a doggedness not to be expected of her
Im going to take the Johnson Scholarship in Mathematics she announced calmly
I could take the one in Greek easily but Id rather take the mathematical one because I want to prove to Jonas that Im really enormously clever
Jonas likes you better for your big brown eyes and your crooked smile than for all the brains you carry under your curls said Anne
When I was a girl it wasnt considered ladylike to know anything about Mathematics said Aunt Jamesina
But times have changed
I dont know that its all for the better
Can you cook Phil
No I never cooked anything in my life except a gingerbread and it was a failure  flat in the middle and hilly round the edges
You know the kind
But Aunty when I begin in good earnest to learn to cook dont you think the brains that enable me to win a mathematical scholarship will also enable me to learn cooking just as well
Maybe said Aunt Jamesina cautiously
I am not decrying the higher education of women
My daughter is an MA
She can cook too
But I taught her to cook BEFORE I let a college professor teach her Mathematics
In midMarch came a letter from Miss Patty Spofford saying that she and Miss Maria had decided to remain abroad for another year
So you may have Pattys Place next winter too she wrote
Maria and I are going to run over Egypt
I want to see the Sphinx once before I die
Fancy those two dames running over Egypt
I wonder if theyll look up at the Sphinx and knit laughed Priscilla
Im so glad we can keep Pattys Place for another year said Stella
I was afraid theyd come back
And then our jolly little nest here would be broken up  and we poor callow nestlings thrown out on the cruel world of boardinghouses again
Im off for a tramp in the park announced Phil tossing her book aside
I think when I am eighty Ill be glad I went for a walk in the park tonight
What do you mean
asked Anne
Come with me and Ill tell you honey
They captured in their ramble all the mysteries and magics of a March evening
Very still and mild it was wrapped in a great white brooding silence  a silence which was yet threaded through with many little silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened as much with your soul as your ears
The girls wandered down a long pineland aisle that seemed to lead right out into the heart of a deepred overflowing winter sunset
Id go home and write a poem this blessed minute if I only knew how declared Phil pausing in an open space where a rosy light was staining the green tips of the pines
Its all so wonderful here  this great white stillness and those dark trees that always seem to be thinking
The woods were Gods first temples quoted Anne softly
One cant help feeling reverent and adoring in such a place
I always feel so near Him when I walk among the pines
Anne Im the happiest girl in the world confessed Phil suddenly
So Mr Blake has asked you to marry him at last
said Anne calmly
Yes
And I sneezed three times while he was asking me
Wasnt that horrid
But I said yes almost before he finished  I was so afraid he might change his mind and stop
Im besottedly happy
I couldnt really believe before that Jonas would ever care for frivolous me
Phil youre not really frivolous said Anne gravely
Way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours youve got a dear loyal womanly little soul
Why do you hide it so
I cant help it Queen Anne
You are right  Im not frivolous at heart
But theres a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and I cant take it off
As Mrs Poyser says Id have to be hatched over again and hatched different before I could change it
But Jonas knows the real me and loves me frivolity and all
And I love him
I never was so surprised in my life as I was when I found out I loved him
Id never thought it possible to fall in love with an ugly man
Fancy me coming down to one solitary beau
And one named Jonas
But I mean to call him Jo
Thats such a nice crisp little name
I couldnt nickname Alonzo
What about Alec and Alonzo
Oh I told them at Christmas that I never could marry either of them
It seems so funny now to remember that I ever thought it possible that I might
They felt so badly I just cried over both of them  howled
But I knew there was only one man in the world I could ever marry
I had made up my own mind for once and it was real easy too
Its very delightful to feel so sure and know its your own sureness and not somebody elses
Do you suppose youll be able to keep it up
Making up my mind you mean
I dont know but Jo has given me a splendid rule
He says when Im perplexed just to do what I would wish I had done when I shall be eighty
Anyhow Jo can make up his mind quickly enough and it would be uncomfortable to have too much mind in the same house
What will your father and mother say
Father wont say much
He thinks everything I do right
But mother WILL talk
Oh her tongue will be as Byrney as her nose
But in the end it will be all right
Youll have to give up a good many things youve always had when you marry Mr Blake Phil
But Ill have HIM
I wont miss the other things
Were to be married a year from next June
Jo graduates from St Columbia this spring you know
Then hes going to take a little mission church down on Patterson Street in the slums
Fancy me in the slums
But Id go there or to Greenlands icy mountains with him
And this is the girl who would NEVER marry a man who wasnt rich commented Anne to a young pine tree
Oh dont cast up the follies of my youth to me
I shall be poor as gaily as Ive been rich
Youll see
Im going to learn how to cook and make over dresses
Ive learned how to market since Ive lived at Pattys Place and once I taught a Sunday School class for a whole summer
Aunt Jamesina says Ill ruin Jos career if I marry him
But I wont
I know I havent much sense or sobriety but Ive got what is ever so much better  the knack of making people like me
There is a man in Bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayermeeting
He says If you cant thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick
Ill be Jos little candlestick
Phil youre incorrigible
Well I love you so much that I cant make nice light congratulatory little speeches
But Im heartglad of your happiness
I know
Those big gray eyes of yours are brimming over with real friendship Anne
Some day Ill look the same way at you
Youre going to marry Roy arent you Anne
My dear Philippa did you ever hear of the famous Betty Baxter who refused a man before hed axed her
I am not going to emulate that celebrated lady by either refusing or accepting any one before he axes me
All Redmond knows that Roy is crazy about you said Phil candidly
And you DO love him dont you Anne
I  I suppose so said Anne reluctantly
She felt that she ought to be blushing while making such a confession but she was not on the other hand she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about Gilbert Blythe or Christine Stuart in her hearing
Gilbert Blythe and Christine Stuart were nothing to her  absolutely nothing
But Anne had given up trying to analyze the reason of her blushes
As for Roy of course she was in love with him  madly so
How could she help it
Was he not her ideal
Who could resist those glorious dark eyes and that pleading voice
Were not half the Redmond girls wildly envious
And what a charming sonnet he had sent her with a box of violets on her birthday
Anne knew every word of it by heart
It was very good stuff of its kind too
Not exactly up to the level of Keats or Shakespeare  even Anne was not so deeply in love as to think that
But it was very tolerable magazine verse
And it was addressed to HER  not to Laura or Beatrice or the Maid of Athens but to her Anne Shirley
To be told in rhythmical cadences that her eyes were stars of the morning  that her cheek had the flush it stole from the sunrise  that her lips were redder than the roses of Paradise was thrillingly romantic
Gilbert would never have dreamed of writing a sonnet to her eyebrows
But then Gilbert could see a joke
She had once told Roy a funny story  and he had not seen the point of it
She recalled the chummy laugh she and Gilbert had had together over it and wondered uneasily if life with a man who had no sense of humor might not be somewhat uninteresting in the long run
But who could expect a melancholy inscrutable hero to see the humorous side of things
It would be flatly unreasonable
Chapter XXVIII A June Evening I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always June said Anne as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door steps where Marilla and Mrs Rachel were sitting talking over Mrs Samson Coates funeral which they had attended that day
Dora sat between them diligently studying her lessons but Davy was sitting tailorfashion on the grass looking as gloomy and depressed as his single dimple would let him
Youd get tired of it said Marilla with a sigh
I daresay but just now I feel that it would take me a long time to get tired of it if it were all as charming as today
Everything loves June
Davyboy why this melancholy November face in blossomtime
Im just sick and tired of living said the youthful pessimist
At ten years
Dear me how sad
Im not making fun said Davy with dignity
Im dis  dis  discouraged  bringing out the big word with a valiant effort
Why and wherefore
asked Anne sitting down beside him
Cause the new teacher that come when Mr Holmes got sick give me ten sums to do for Monday
Itll take me all day tomorrow to do them
It isnt fair to have to work Saturdays
Milty Boulter said he wouldnt do them but Marilla says Ive got to
I dont like Miss Carson a bit
Dont talk like that about your teacher Davy Keith said Mrs Rachel severely
Miss Carson is a very fine girl
There is no nonsense about her
That doesnt sound very attractive laughed Anne
I like people to have a little nonsense about them
But Im inclined to have a better opinion of Miss Carson than you have
I saw her in prayermeeting last night and she has a pair of eyes that cant always look sensible
Now Davyboy take heart of grace
Tomorrow will bring another day and Ill help you with the sums as far as in me lies
Dont waste this lovely hour twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic
Well I wont said Davy brightening up
If you help me with the sums Ill have em done in time to go fishing with Milty
I wish old Aunt Atossas funeral was tomorrow instead of today
I wanted to go to it cause Milty said his mother said Aunt Atossa would be sure to rise up in her coffin and say sarcastic things to the folks that come to see her buried
But Marilla said she didnt
Poor Atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough said Mrs Lynde solemnly
I never saw her look so pleasant before thats what
Well there werent many tears shed over her poor old soul
The Elisha Wrights are thankful to be rid of her and I cant say I blame them a mite
It seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not leave one person behind you who is sorry you are gone said Anne shuddering
Nobody except her parents ever loved poor Atossa thats certain not even her husband averred Mrs Lynde
She was his fourth wife
Hed sort of got into the habit of marrying
He only lived a few years after he married her
The doctor said he died of dyspepsia but I shall always maintain that he died of Atossas tongue thats what
Poor soul she always knew everything about her neighbors but she never was very well acquainted with herself
Well shes gone anyhow and I suppose the next excitement will be Dianas wedding
It seems funny and horrible to think of Dianas being married sighed Anne hugging her knees and looking through the gap in the Haunted Wood to the light that was shining in Dianas room
I dont see whats horrible about it when shes doing so well said Mrs Lynde emphatically
Fred Wright has a fine farm and he is a model young man
He certainly isnt the wild dashing wicked young man Diana once wanted to marry smiled Anne
Fred is extremely good
Thats just what he ought to be
Would you want Diana to marry a wicked man
Or marry one yourself
Oh no
I wouldnt want to marry anybody who was wicked but I think Id like it if he COULD be wicked and WOULDNT
Now Fred is HOPELESSLY good
Youll have more sense some day I hope said Marilla
Marilla spoke rather bitterly
She was grievously disappointed
She knew Anne had refused Gilbert Blythe
Avonlea gossip buzzed over the fact which had leaked out nobody knew how
Perhaps Charlie Sloane had guessed and told his guesses for truth
Perhaps Diana had betrayed it to Fred and Fred had been indiscreet
At all events it was known Mrs Blythe no longer asked Anne in public or private if she had heard lately from Gilbert but passed her by with a frosty bow
Anne who had always liked Gilberts merry younghearted mother was grieved in secret over this
Marilla said nothing but Mrs Lynde gave Anne many exasperated digs about it until fresh gossip reached that worthy lady through the medium of Moody Spurgeon MacPhersons mother that Anne had another beau at college who was rich and handsome and good all in one
After that Mrs Rachel held her tongue though she still wished in her inmost heart that Anne had accepted Gilbert
Riches were all very well but even Mrs Rachel practical soul though she was did not consider them the one essential
If Anne liked the Handsome Unknown better than Gilbert there was nothing more to be said but Mrs Rachel was dreadfully afraid that Anne was going to make the mistake of marrying for money
Marilla knew Anne too well to fear this but she felt that something in the universal scheme of things had gone sadly awry
What is to be will be said Mrs Rachel gloomily and what isnt to be happens sometimes
I cant help believing its going to happen in Annes case if Providence doesnt interfere thats what
Mrs Rachel sighed
She was afraid Providence wouldnt interfere and she didnt dare to
Anne had wandered down to the Dryads Bubble and was curled up among the ferns at the root of the big white birch where she and Gilbert had so often sat in summers gone by
He had gone into the newspaper office again when college closed and Avonlea seemed very dull without him
He never wrote to her and Anne missed the letters that never came
To be sure Roy wrote twice a week his letters were exquisite compositions which would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography
Anne felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them but her heart never gave the queer quick painful bound at sight of his letters which it had given one day when Mrs Hiram Sloane had handed her out an envelope addressed in Gilberts black upright handwriting
Anne had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerly  to find a typewritten copy of some college society report  only that and nothing more
Anne flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to write an especially nice epistle to Roy
Diana was to be married in five more days
The gray house at Orchard Slope was in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing for there was to be a big oldtimey wedding
Anne of course was to be bridesmaid as had been arranged when they were twelve years old and Gilbert was coming from Kingsport to be best man
Anne was enjoying the excitement of the various preparations but under it all she carried a little heartache
She was in a sense losing her dear old chum Dianas new home would be two miles from Green Gables and the old constant companionship could never be theirs again
Anne looked up at Dianas light and thought how it had beaconed to her for many years but soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more
Two big painful tears welled up in her gray eyes
Oh she thought how horrible it is that people have to grow up  and marry  and CHANGE
Chapter XXIX Dianas Wedding After all the only real roses are the pink ones said Anne as she tied white ribbon around Dianas bouquet in the westwardlooking gable at Orchard Slope
They are the flowers of love and faith
Diana was standing nervously in the middle of the room arrayed in her bridal white her black curls frosted over with the film of her wedding veil
Anne had draped that veil in accordance with the sentimental compact of years before
Its all pretty much as I used to imagine it long ago when I wept over your inevitable marriage and our consequent parting she laughed
You are the bride of my dreams Diana with the lovely misty veil and I am YOUR bridesmaid
But alas
I havent the puffed sleeves  though these short lace ones are even prettier
Neither is my heart wholly breaking nor do I exactly hate Fred
We are not really parting Anne protested Diana
Im not going far away
Well love each other just as much as ever
Weve always kept that oath of friendship we swore long ago havent we
Yes
Weve kept it faithfully
Weve had a beautiful friendship Diana
Weve never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word and I hope it will always be so
But things cant be quite the same after this
Youll have other interests
Ill just be on the outside
But such is life as Mrs Rachel says
Mrs Rachel has given you one of her beloved knitted quilts of the tobacco stripe pattern and she says when I am married shell give me one too
The mean thing about your getting married is that I wont be able to be your bridesmaid lamented Diana
Im to be Phils bridesmaid next June when she marries Mr Blake and then I must stop for you know the proverb three times a bridesmaid never a bride  said Anne peeping through the window over the pink and snow of the blossoming orchard beneath
Here comes the minister Diana
Oh Anne gasped Diana suddenly turning very pale and beginning to tremble
Oh Anne  Im so nervous  I cant go through with it  Anne I know Im going to faint
If you do Ill drag you down to the rainwater hogshed and drop you in said Anne unsympathetically
Cheer up dearest
Getting married cant be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony
See how cool and composed I am and take courage
Wait till your turn comes Miss Anne
Oh Anne I hear father coming upstairs
Give me my bouquet
Is my veil right
Am I very pale
You look just lovely
Di darling kiss me goodbye for the last time
Diana Barry will never kiss me again
Diana Wright will though
There mothers calling
Come
Following the simple oldfashioned way in vogue then Anne went down to the parlor on Gilberts arm
They met at the top of the stairs for the first time since they had left Kingsport for Gilbert had arrived only that day
Gilbert shook hands courteously
He was looking very well though as Anne instantly noted rather thin
He was not pale there was a flush on his cheek that had burned into it as Anne came along the hall towards him in her soft white dress with liliesofthevalley in the shining masses of her hair
As they entered the crowded parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around the room
What a finelooking pair they are whispered the impressible Mrs Rachel to Marilla
Fred ambled in alone with a very red face and then Diana swept in on her fathers arm
She did not faint and nothing untoward occurred to interrupt the ceremony
Feasting and merrymaking followed then as the evening waned Fred and Diana drove away through the moonlight to their new home and Gilbert walked with Anne to Green Gables
Something of their old comradeship had returned during the informal mirth of the evening
Oh it was nice to be walking over that wellknown road with Gilbert again
The night was so very still that one should have been able to hear the whisper of roses in blossom  the laughter of daisies  the piping of grasses  many sweet sounds all tangled up together
The beauty of moonlight on familiar fields irradiated the world
Cant we take a ramble up Lovers Lane before you go in
asked Gilbert as they crossed the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters in which the moon lay like a great drowned blossom of gold
Anne assented readily
Lovers Lane was a veritable path in a fairyland that night  a shimmering mysterious place full of wizardry in the whitewoven enchantment of moonlight
There had been a time when such a walk with Gilbert through Lovers Lane would have been far too dangerous
But Roy and Christine had made it very safe now
Anne found herself thinking a good deal about Christine as she chatted lightly to Gilbert
She had met her several times before leaving Kingsport and had been charmingly sweet to her
Christine had also been charmingly sweet
Indeed they were a most cordial pair
But for all that their acquaintance had not ripened into friendship
Evidently Christine was not a kindred spirit
Are you going to be in Avonlea all summer
asked Gilbert
No
Im going down east to Valley Road next week
Esther Haythorne wants me to teach for her through July and August
They have a summer term in that school and Esther isnt feeling well
So Im going to substitute for her
In one way I dont mind
Do you know Im beginning to feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now
It makes me sorry  but its true
Its quite appalling to see the number of children who have shot up into big boys and girls  really young men and women  these past two years
Half of my pupils are grown up
It makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used to fill
Anne laughed and sighed
She felt very old and mature and wise  which showed how young she was
She told herself that she longed greatly to go back to those dear merry days when life was seen through a rosy mist of hope and illusion and possessed an indefinable something that had passed away forever
Where was it now  the glory and the dream
So wags the world away  quoted Gilbert practically and a trifle absently
Anne wondered if he were thinking of Christine
Oh Avonlea was going to be so lonely now  with Diana gone
Chapter XXX Mrs Skinners Romance Anne stepped off the train at Valley Road station and looked about to see if any one had come to meet her
She was to board with a certain Miss Janet Sweet but she saw no one who answered in the least to her preconception of that lady as formed from Esthers letter
The only person in sight was an elderly woman sitting in a wagon with mail bags piled around her
Two hundred would have been a charitable guess at her weight her face was as round and red as a harvestmoon and almost as featureless
She wore a tight black cashmere dress made in the fashion of ten years ago a little dusty black straw hat trimmed with bows of yellow ribbon and faded black lace mits
Here you she called waving her whip at Anne
Are you the new Valley Road schoolmaam
Yes
Well I thought so
Valley Road is noted for its goodlooking schoolmaams just as Millersville is noted for its humly ones
Janet Sweet asked me this morning if I could bring you out
I said Sartin I kin if she dont mind being scrunched up some
This rig of mines kinder small for the mail bags and Im some heftier than Thomas
Just wait miss till I shift these bags a bit and Ill tuck you in somehow
Its only two miles to Janets
Her nextdoor neighbors hired boy is coming for your trunk tonight
My name is Skinner  Amelia Skinner
Anne was eventually tucked in exchanging amused smiles with herself during the process
Jog along black mare commanded Mrs Skinner gathering up the reins in her pudgy hands
This is my first trip on the mail rowte
Thomas wanted to hoe his turnips today so he asked me to come
So I jest sot down and took a standingup snack and started
I sorter like it
O course its rather tejus
Part of the time I sits and thinks and the rest I jest sits
Jog along black mare
I want to git home airly
Thomas is terrible lonesome when Im away
You see we havent been married very long
Oh
said Anne politely
Just a month
Thomas courted me for quite a spell though
It was real romantic
Anne tried to picture Mrs Skinner on speaking terms with romance and failed
Oh
she said again
Yes
Ysee there was another man after me
Jog along black mare
Id been a widder so long folks had given up expecting me to marry again
But when my darter  shes a schoolmaam like you  went out West to teach I felt real lonesome and wasnt nowise sot against the idea
Bimeby Thomas began to come up and so did the other feller  William Obadiah Seaman his name was
For a long time I couldnt make up my mind which of them to take and they kep coming and coming and I kep worrying
Ysee WO
was rich  he had a fine place and carried considerable style
He was by far the best match
Jog along black mare
Why didnt you marry him
asked Anne
Well ysee he didnt love me answered Mrs Skinner solemnly
Anne opened her eyes widely and looked at Mrs Skinner
But there was not a glint of humor on that ladys face
Evidently Mrs Skinner saw nothing amusing in her own case
Hed been a widderman for three yers and his sister kept house for him
Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house
It was worth looking after too mind you that
Its a handsome house
Jog along black mare
As for Thomas he was poor and if his house didnt leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it though it looks kind of pictureaskew
But ysee I loved Thomas and I didnt care one red cent for WO
So I argued it out with myself
Sarah Crowe say I  my first was a Crowe  you can marry your rich man if you like but you wont be happy
Folks cant get along together in this world without a little bit of love
Youd just better tie up to Thomas for he loves you and you love him and nothing else aint going to do you
Jog along black mare
So I told Thomas Id take him
All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past WO
s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again
But now I never think of it at all and Im just that comfortable and happy with Thomas
Jog along black mare
How did William Obadiah take it
queried Anne
Oh he rumpussed a bit
But hes going to see a skinny old maid in Millersville now and I guess shell take him fast enough
Shell make him a better wife than his first did
WO
never wanted to marry her
He just asked her to marry him cause his father wanted him to never dreaming but that shed say no
But mind you she said yes
There was a predicament for you
Jog along black mare
She was a great housekeeper but most awful mean
She wore the same bonnet for eighteen years
Then she got a new one and WO
met her on the road and didnt know her
Jog along black mare
I feel that Id a narrer escape
I might have married him and been most awful miserable like my poor cousin Jane Ann
Jane Ann married a rich man she didnt care anything about and she hasnt the life of a dog
She come to see me last week and says says she Sarah Skinner I envy you
Id rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man I was fond of than in my big house with the one Ive got
Jane Anns man aint such a bad sort nuther though hes so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the thermometers at ninety
The only way to git him to do anything is to coax him to do the opposite
But there aint any love to smooth things down and its a poor way of living
Jog along black mare
Theres Janets place in the hollow  Wayside she calls it
Quite pictureaskew aint it
I guess youll be glad to git out of this with all them mail bags jamming round you
Yes but I have enjoyed my drive with you very much said Anne sincerely
Git away now
said Mrs Skinner highly flattered
Wait till I tell Thomas that
He always feels dretful tickled when I git a compliment
Jog along black mare
Well here we are
I hope youll git on well in the school miss
Theres a short cut to it through the mash back of Janets
If you take that way be awful keerful
If you once got stuck in that black mud youd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment like Adam Palmers cow
Jog along black mare
Chapter XXXI Anne to Philippa Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon greeting
Wellbeloved its high time I was writing you
Here am I installed once more as a country schoolmaam at Valley Road boarding at Wayside the home of Miss Janet Sweet
Janet is a dear soul and very nicelooking tall but not overtall stoutish yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois
She has a knot of soft crimpy brown hair with a thread of gray in it a sunny face with rosy cheeks and big kind eyes as blue as forgetmenots
Moreover she is one of those delightful oldfashioned cooks who dont care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things
I like her and she likes me  principally it seems because she had a sister named Anne who died young
Im real glad to see you she said briskly when I landed in her yard
My you dont look a mite like I expected
I was sure youd be dark  my sister Anne was dark
And here youre redheaded
For a few minutes I thought I wasnt going to like Janet as much as I had expected at first sight
Then I reminded myself that I really must be more sensible than to be prejudiced against any one simply because she called my hair red
Probably the word auburn was not in Janets vocabulary at all
Wayside is a dear sort of little spot
The house is small and white set down in a delightful little hollow that drops away from the road
Between road and house is an orchard and flowergarden all mixed up together
The front door walk is bordered with quahog clamshells  cowhawks Janet calls them there is Virginia Creeper over the porch and moss on the roof
My room is a neat little spot off the parlor  just big enough for the bed and me
Over the head of my bed there is a picture of Robby Burns standing at Highland Marys grave shadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree
Robbys face is so lugubrious that it is no wonder I have bad dreams
Why the first night I was here I dreamed I COULDNT LAUGH
The parlor is tiny and neat
Its one window is so shaded by a huge willow that the room has a grottolike effect of emerald gloom
There are wonderful tidies on the chairs and gay mats on the floor and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table and vases of dried grass on the mantelpiece
Between the vases is a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin plates  five in all pertaining respectively to Janets father and mother a brother her sister Anne and a hired man who died here once
If I go suddenly insane some of these days know all men by these presents that those coffinplates have caused it
But its all delightful and I said so
Janet loved me for it just as she detested poor Esther because Esther had said so much shade was unhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed
Now I glory in featherbeds and the more unhygienic and feathery they are the more I glory
Janet says it is such a comfort to see me eat she had been so afraid I would be like Miss Haythorne who wouldnt eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and tried to make Janet give up frying things
Esther is really a dear girl but she is rather given to fads
The trouble is that she hasnt enough imagination and HAS a tendency to indigestion
Janet told me I could have the use of the parlor when any young men called
I dont think there are many to call
I havent seen a young man in Valley Road yet except the nextdoor hired boy  Sam Toliver a very tall lank towhaired youth
He came over one evening recently and sat for an hour on the garden fence near the front porch where Janet and I were doing fancywork
The only remarks he volunteered in all that time were Hev a peppermint miss
Dew nowfine thing for carARRH peppermints and Powerful lot o jumpgrasses round here ternight
Yep
But there is a love affair going on here
It seems to be my fortune to be mixed up more or less actively with elderly love affairs
Mr and Mrs Irving always say that I brought about their marriage
Mrs Stephen Clark of Carmody persists in being most grateful to me for a suggestion which somebody else would probably have made if I hadnt
I do really think though that Ludovic Speed would never have got any further along than placid courtship if I had not helped him and Theodora Dix out
In the present affair I am only a passive spectator
Ive tried once to help things along and made an awful mess of it
So I shall not meddle again
Ill tell you all about it when we meet
Chapter XXXII Tea with Mrs Douglas On the first Thursday night of Annes sojourn in Valley Road Janet asked her to go to prayermeeting
Janet blossomed out like a rose to attend that prayermeeting
She wore a paleblue pansysprinkled muslin dress with more ruffles than one would ever have supposed economical Janet could be guilty of and a white leghorn hat with pink roses and three ostrich feathers on it
Anne felt quite amazed
Later on she found out Janets motive in so arraying herself  a motive as old as Eden
Valley Road prayermeetings seemed to be essentially feminine
There were thirtytwo women present two halfgrown boys and one solitary man beside the minister
Anne found herself studying this man
He was not handsome or young or graceful he had remarkably long legs  so long that he had to keep them coiled up under his chair to dispose of them  and he was stoopshouldered
His hands were big his hair wanted barbering and his moustache was unkempt
But Anne thought she liked his face it was kind and honest and tender there was something else in it too  just what Anne found it hard to define
She finally concluded that this man had suffered and been strong and it had been made manifest in his face
There was a sort of patient humorous endurance in his expression which indicated that he would go to the stake if need be but would keep on looking pleasant until he really had to begin squirming
When prayermeeting was over this man came up to Janet and said May I see you home Janet
Janet took his arm  as primly and shyly as if she were no more than sixteen having her first escort home Anne told the girls at Pattys Place later on
Miss Shirley permit me to introduce Mr Douglas she said stiffly
Mr Douglas nodded and said I was looking at you in prayermeeting miss and thinking what a nice little girl you were
Such a speech from ninetynine people out of a hundred would have annoyed Anne bitterly but the way in which Mr Douglas said it made her feel that she had received a very real and pleasing compliment
She smiled appreciatively at him and dropped obligingly behind on the moonlit road
So Janet had a beau
Anne was delighted
Janet would make a paragon of a wife  cheery economical tolerant and a very queen of cooks
It would be a flagrant waste on Natures part to keep her a permanent old maid
John Douglas asked me to take you up to see his mother said Janet the next day
Shes bedrid a lot of the time and never goes out of the house
But shes powerful fond of company and always wants to see my boarders
Can you go up this evening
Anne assented but later in the day Mr Douglas called on his mothers behalf to invite them up to tea on Saturday evening
Oh why didnt you put on your pretty pansy dress
asked Anne when they left home
It was a hot day and poor Janet between her excitement and her heavy black cashmere dress looked as if she were being broiled alive
Old Mrs Douglas would think it terrible frivolous and unsuitable Im afraid
John likes that dress though she added wistfully
The old Douglas homestead was half a mile from Wayside cresting a windy hill
The house itself was large and comfortable old enough to be dignified and girdled with maple groves and orchards
There were big trim barns behind it and everything bespoke prosperity
Whatever the patient endurance in Mr Douglas face had meant it hadnt so Anne reflected meant debts and duns
John Douglas met them at the door and took them into the sittingroom where his mother was enthroned in an armchair
Anne had expected old Mrs Douglas to be tall and thin because Mr Douglas was
Instead she was a tiny scrap of a woman with soft pink cheeks mild blue eyes and a mouth like a babys
Dressed in a beautiful fashionablymade black silk dress with a fluffy white shawl over her shoulders and her snowy hair surmounted by a dainty lace cap she might have posed as a grandmother doll
How do you do Janet dear
she said sweetly
I am so glad to see you again dear
She put up her pretty old face to be kissed
And this is our new teacher
Im delighted to meet you
My son has been singing your praises until Im half jealous and Im sure Janet ought to be wholly so
Poor Janet blushed Anne said something polite and conventional and then everybody sat down and made talk
It was hard work even for Anne for nobody seemed at ease except old Mrs Douglas who certainly did not find any difficulty in talking
She made Janet sit by her and stroked her hand occasionally
Janet sat and smiled looking horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress and John Douglas sat without smiling
At the tea table Mrs Douglas gracefully asked Janet to pour the tea
Janet turned redder than ever but did it
Anne wrote a description of that meal to Stella
We had cold tongue and chicken and strawberry preserves lemon pie and tarts and chocolate cake and raisin cookies and pound cake and fruit cake  and a few other things including more pie  caramel pie I think it was
After I had eaten twice as much as was good for me Mrs Douglas sighed and said she feared she had nothing to tempt my appetite
Im afraid dear Janets cooking has spoiled you for any other she said sweetly
Of course nobody in Valley Road aspires to rival HER
WONT you have another piece of pie Miss Shirley
You havent eaten ANYTHING
Stella I had eaten a helping of tongue and one of chicken three biscuits a generous allowance of preserves a piece of pie a tart and a square of chocolate cake
After tea Mrs Douglas smiled benevolently and told John to take dear Janet out into the garden and get her some roses
Miss Shirley will keep me company while you are out  wont you
she said plaintively
She settled down in her armchair with a sigh
I am a very frail old woman Miss Shirley
For over twenty years Ive been a great sufferer
For twenty long weary years Ive been dying by inches
How painful
said Anne trying to be sympathetic and succeeding only in feeling idiotic
There have been scores of nights when theyve thought I could never live to see the dawn went on Mrs Douglas solemnly
Nobody knows what Ive gone through  nobody can know but myself
Well it cant last very much longer now
My weary pilgrimage will soon be over Miss Shirley
It is a great comfort to me that John will have such a good wife to look after him when his mother is gone  a great comfort Miss Shirley
Janet is a lovely woman said Anne warmly
Lovely
A beautiful character assented Mrs Douglas
And a perfect housekeeper  something I never was
My health would not permit it Miss Shirley
I am indeed thankful that John has made such a wise choice
I hope and believe that he will be happy
He is my only son Miss Shirley and his happiness lies very near my heart
Of course said Anne stupidly
For the first time in her life she was stupid
Yet she could not imagine why
She seemed to have absolutely nothing to say to this sweet smiling angelic old lady who was patting her hand so kindly
Come and see me soon again dear Janet said Mrs Douglas lovingly when they left
You dont come half often enough
But then I suppose John will be bringing you here to stay all the time one of these days
Anne happening to glance at John Douglas as his mother spoke gave a positive start of dismay
He looked as a tortured man might look when his tormentors gave the rack the last turn of possible endurance
She felt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blushing Janet away
Isnt old Mrs Douglas a sweet woman
asked Janet as they went down the road
M  m answered Anne absently
She was wondering why John Douglas had looked so
Shes been a terrible sufferer said Janet feelingly
She takes terrible spells
It keeps John all worried up
Hes scared to leave home for fear his mother will take a spell and nobody there but the hired girl
Chapter XXXIII He Just Kept Coming and Coming Three days later Anne came home from school and found Janet crying
Tears and Janet seemed so incongruous that Anne was honestly alarmed
Oh what is the matter
she cried anxiously
Im  Im forty today sobbed Janet
Well you were nearly that yesterday and it didnt hurt comforted Anne trying not to smile
But  but went on Janet with a big gulp John Douglas wont ask me to marry him
Oh but he will said Anne lamely
You must give him time Janet Time
said Janet with indescribable scorn
He has had twenty years
How much time does he want
Do you mean that John Douglas has been coming to see you for twenty years
He has
And he has never so much as mentioned marriage to me
And I dont believe he ever will now
Ive never said a word to a mortal about it but it seems to me Ive just got to talk it out with some one at last or go crazy
John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago before mother died
Well he kept coming and coming and after a spell I begun making quilts and things but he never said anything about getting married only just kept coming and coming
There wasnt anything I could do
Mother died when wed been going together for eight years
I thought he maybe would speak out then seeing as I was left alone in the world
He was real kind and feeling and did everything he could for me but he never said marry
And thats the way it has been going on ever since
People blame ME for it
They say I wont marry him because his mother is so sickly and I dont want the bother of waiting on her
Why Id LOVE to wait on Johns mother
But I let them think so
Id rather theyd blame me than pity me
Its so dreadful humiliating that John wont ask me
And WHY wont he
Seems to me if I only knew his reason I wouldnt mind it so much
Perhaps his mother doesnt want him to marry anybody suggested Anne
Oh she does
Shes told me time and again that shed love to see John settled before her time comes
Shes always giving him hints  you heard her yourself the other day
I thought Id ha gone through the floor
Its beyond me said Anne helplessly
She thought of Ludovic Speed
But the cases were not parallel
John Douglas was not a man of Ludovics type
You should show more spirit Janet she went on resolutely
Why didnt you send him about his business long ago
I couldnt said poor Janet pathetically
You see Anne Ive always been awful fond of John
He might just as well keep coming as not for there was never anybody else Id want so it didnt matter
But it might have made him speak out like a man urged Anne
Janet shook her head
No I guess not
I was afraid to try anyway for fear hed think I meant it and just go
I suppose Im a poorspirited creature but that is how I feel
And I cant help it
Oh you COULD help it Janet
It isnt too late yet
Take a firm stand
Let that man know you are not going to endure his shillyshallying any longer
ILL back you up
I dunno said Janet hopelessly
I dunno if I could ever get up enough spunk
Things have drifted so long
But Ill think it over
Anne felt that she was disappointed in John Douglas
She had liked him so well and she had not thought him the sort of man who would play fast and loose with a womans feelings for twenty years
He certainly should be taught a lesson and Anne felt vindictively that she would enjoy seeing the process
Therefore she was delighted when Janet told her as they were going to prayermeeting the next night that she meant to show some sperrit
Ill let John Douglas see Im not going to be trodden on any longer
You are perfectly right said Anne emphatically
When prayermeeting was over John Douglas came up with his usual request
Janet looked frightened but resolute
No thank you she said icily
I know the road home pretty well alone
I ought to seeing Ive been traveling it for forty years
So you neednt trouble yourself MR
Douglas
Anne was looking at John Douglas and in that brilliant moonlight she saw the last twist of the rack again
Without a word he turned and strode down the road
Stop
Stop
Anne called wildly after him not caring in the least for the other dumbfounded onlookers
Mr Douglas stop
Come back
John Douglas stopped but he did not come back
Anne flew down the road caught his arm and fairly dragged him back to Janet
You must come back she said imploringly
Its all a mistake Mr Douglas  all my fault
I made Janet do it
She didnt want to  but its all right now isnt it Janet
Without a word Janet took his arm and walked away
Anne followed them meekly home and slipped in by the back door
Well you are a nice person to back me up said Janet sarcastically
I couldnt help it Janet said Anne repentantly
I just felt as if I had stood by and seen murder done
I HAD to run after him
Oh Im just as glad you did
When I saw John Douglas making off down that road I just felt as if every little bit of joy and happiness that was left in my life was going with him
It was an awful feeling
Did he ask you why you did it
asked Anne
No he never said a word about it replied Janet dully
Chapter XXXIV John Douglas Speaks at Last Anne was not without a feeble hope that something might come of it after all
But nothing did
John Douglas came and took Janet driving and walked home from prayermeeting with her as he had been doing for twenty years and as he seemed likely to do for twenty years more
The summer waned
Anne taught her school and wrote letters and studied a little
Her walks to and from school were pleasant
She always went by way of the swamp it was a lovely place  a boggy soil green with the greenest of mossy hillocks a silvery brook meandered through it and spruces stood erectly their boughs atrail with graygreen mosses their roots overgrown with all sorts of woodland lovelinesses
Nevertheless Anne found life in Valley Road a little monotonous
To be sure there was one diverting incident
She had not seen the lank towheaded Samuel of the peppermints since the evening of his call save for chance meetings on the road
But one warm August night he appeared and solemnly seated himself on the rustic bench by the porch
He wore his usual working habiliments consisting of varipatched trousers a blue jean shirt out at the elbows and a ragged straw hat
He was chewing a straw and he kept on chewing it while he looked solemnly at Anne
Anne laid her book aside with a sigh and took up her doily
Conversation with Sam was really out of the question
After a long silence Sam suddenly spoke
Im leaving over there he said abruptly waving his straw in the direction of the neighboring house
Oh are you
said Anne politely
Yep
And where are you going now
Wall Ive been thinking some of gitting a place of my own
Theres one thatd suit me over at Millersville
But ef I rents it Ill want a woman
I suppose so said Anne vaguely
Yep
There was another long silence
Finally Sam removed his straw again and said Will yeh hev me
Wh  a  t
gasped Anne
Will yeh hev me
Do you mean  MARRY you
queried poor Anne feebly
Yep
Why Im hardly acquainted with you cried Anne indignantly
But yehd git acquainted with me after we was married said Sam
Anne gathered up her poor dignity
Certainly I wont marry you she said haughtily
Wall yeh might do worse expostulated Sam
Im a good worker and Ive got some money in the bank
Dont speak of this to me again
Whatever put such an idea into your head
said Anne her sense of humor getting the better of her wrath
It was such an absurd situation
Yehre a likelylooking girl and hev a rightsmart way o stepping said Sam
I dont want no lazy woman
Think it over
I wont change my mind yit awhile
Wall I must be gitting
Gotter milk the cows
Annes illusions concerning proposals had suffered so much of late years that there were few of them left
So she could laugh wholeheartedly over this one not feeling any secret sting
She mimicked poor Sam to Janet that night and both of them laughed immoderately over his plunge into sentiment
One afternoon when Annes sojourn in Valley Road was drawing to a close Alec Ward came driving down to Wayside in hot haste for Janet
They want you at the Douglas place quick he said
I really believe old Mrs Douglas is going to die at last after pretending to do it for twenty years
Janet ran to get her hat
Anne asked if Mrs Douglas was worse than usual
Shes not half as bad said Alec solemnly and thats what makes me think its serious
Other times shed be screaming and throwing herself all over the place
This time shes lying still and mum
When Mrs Douglas is mum she is pretty sick you bet
You dont like old Mrs
Douglas
said Anne curiously
I like cats as IS cats
I dont like cats as is women was Alecs cryptic reply
Janet came home in the twilight
Mrs Douglas is dead she said wearily
She died soon after I got there
She just spoke to me once  I suppose youll marry John now
she said
It cut me to the heart Anne
To think Johns own mother thought I wouldnt marry him because of her
I couldnt say a word either  there were other women there
I was thankful John had gone out
Janet began to cry drearily
But Anne brewed her a hot drink of ginger tea to her comforting
To be sure Anne discovered later on that she had used white pepper instead of ginger but Janet never knew the difference
The evening after the funeral Janet and Anne were sitting on the front porch steps at sunset
The wind had fallen asleep in the pinelands and lurid sheets of heatlightning flickered across the northern skies
Janet wore her ugly black dress and looked her very worst her eyes and nose red from crying
They talked little for Janet seemed faintly to resent Annes efforts to cheer her up
She plainly preferred to be miserable
Suddenly the gatelatch clicked and John Douglas strode into the garden
He walked towards them straight over the geranium bed
Janet stood up
So did Anne
Anne was a tall girl and wore a white dress but John Douglas did not see her
Janet he said will you marry me
The words burst out as if they had been wanting to be said for twenty years and MUST be uttered now before anything else
Janets face was so red from crying that it couldnt turn any redder so it turned a most unbecoming purple
Why didnt you ask me before
she said slowly
I couldnt
She made me promise not to  mother made me promise not to
Nineteen years ago she took a terrible spell
We thought she couldnt live through it
She implored me to promise not to ask you to marry me while she was alive
I didnt want to promise such a thing even though we all thought she couldnt live very long  the doctor only gave her six months
But she begged it on her knees sick and suffering
I had to promise
What had your mother against me
cried Janet
Nothing  nothing
She just didnt want another woman  ANY woman  there while she was living
She said if I didnt promise shed die right there and Id have killed her
So I promised
And shes held me to that promise ever since though Ive gone on my knees to her in my turn to beg her to let me ff
Why didnt you tell me this
asked Janet chokingly
If Id only KNOWN
Why didnt you just tell me
She made me promise I wouldnt tell a soul said John hoarsely
She swore me to it on the Bible Janet Id never have done it if Id dreamed it was to be for so long
Janet youll never know what Ive suffered these nineteen years
I know Ive made you suffer too but youll marry me for all wont you Janet
Oh Janet wont you
Ive come as soon as I could to ask you
At this moment the stupefied Anne came to her senses and realized that she had no business to be there
She slipped away and did not see Janet until the next morning when the latter told her the rest of the story
That cruel relentless deceitful old woman
cried Anne
Hush  shes dead said Janet solemnly
If she wasnt  but she IS
So we mustnt speak evil of her
But Im happy at last Anne
And I wouldnt have minded waiting so long a bit if Id only known why
When are you to be married
Next month
Of course it will be very quiet
I suppose people will talk terrible
Theyll say I made enough haste to snap John up as soon as his poor mother was out of the way
John wanted to let them know the truth but I said No John after all she was your mother and well keep the secret between us and not cast any shadow on her memory
I dont mind what people say now that I know the truth myself
It dont matter a mite
Let it all be buried with the dead says I to him
So I coaxed him round to agree with me
Youre much more forgiving than I could ever be Anne said rather crossly
Youll feel differently about a good many things when you get to be my age said Janet tolerantly
Thats one of the things we learn as we grow older  how to forgive
It comes easier at forty than it did at twenty
Chapter XXXV The Last Redmond Year Opens Here we are all back again nicely sunburned and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race said Phil sitting down on a suitcase with a sigh of pleasure
Isnt it jolly to see this dear old Pattys Place again  and Aunty  and the cats
Rusty has lost another piece of ear hasnt he
Rusty would be the nicest cat in the world if he had no ears at all declared Anne loyally from her trunk while Rusty writhed about her lap in a frenzy of welcome
Arent you glad to see us back Aunty
demanded Phil
Yes
But I wish youd tidy things up said Aunt Jamesina plaintively looking at the wilderness of trunks and suitcases by which the four laughing chattering girls were surrounded
You can talk just as well later on
Work first and then play used to be my motto when I was a girl
Oh weve just reversed that in this generation Aunty
OUR motto is play your play and then dig in
You can do your work so much better if youve had a good bout of play first
If you are going to marry a minister said Aunt Jamesina picking up Joseph and her knitting and resigning herself to the inevitable with the charming grace that made her the queen of housemothers you will have to give up such expressions as dig in
Why
moaned Phil
Oh why must a ministers wife be supposed to utter only prunes and prisms
I shant
Everybody on Patterson Street uses slang  that is to say metaphorical language  and if I didnt they would think me insufferably proud and stuck up
Have you broken the news to your family
asked Priscilla feeding the Sarahcat bits from her lunchbasket
Phil nodded
How did they take it
Oh mother rampaged
But I stood rockfirm  even I Philippa Gordon who never before could hold fast to anything
Father was calmer
Fathers own daddy was a minister so you see he has a soft spot in his heart for the cloth
I had Jo up to Mount Holly after mother grew calm and they both loved him
But mother gave him some frightful hints in every conversation regarding what she had hoped for me
Oh my vacation pathway hasnt been exactly strewn with roses girls dear
But  Ive won out and Ive got Jo
Nothing else matters
To you said Aunt Jamesina darkly
Nor to Jo either retorted Phil
You keep on pitying him
Why pray
I think hes to be envied
Hes getting brains beauty and a heart of gold in ME
Its well we know how to take your speeches said Aunt Jamesina patiently
I hope you dont talk like that before strangers
What would they think
Oh I dont want to know what they think
I dont want to see myself as others see me
Im sure it would be horribly uncomfortable most of the time
I dont believe Burns was really sincere in that prayer either
Oh I daresay we all pray for some things that we really dont want if we were only honest enough to look into our hearts owned Aunt Jamesina candidly
Ive a notion that such prayers dont rise very far
I used to pray that I might be enabled to forgive a certain person but I know now I really didnt want to forgive her
When I finally got that I DID want to I forgave her without having to pray about it
I cant picture you as being unforgiving for long said Stella
Oh I used to be
But holding spite doesnt seem worth while when you get along in years
That reminds me said Anne and told the tale of John and Janet
And now tell us about that romantic scene you hinted so darkly at in one of your letters demanded Phil
Anne acted out Samuels proposal with great spirit
The girls shrieked with laughter and Aunt Jamesina smiled
It isnt in good taste to make fun of your beaux she said severely but she added calmly I always did it myself
Tell us about your beaux Aunty en treated Phil
You must have had any number of them
Theyre not in the past tense retorted Aunt Jamesina
Ive got them yet
There are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheeps eyes at me for some time
You children neednt think you own all the romance in the world
Widowers and sheeps eyes dont sound very romantic Aunty
Well no but young folks arent always romantic either
Some of my beaux certainly werent
I used to laugh at them scandalous poor boys
There was Jim Elwood  he was always in a sort of daydream  never seemed to sense what was going on
He didnt wake up to the fact that Id said no till a year after Id said it
When he did get married his wife fell out of the sleigh one night when they were driving home from church and he never missed her
Then there was Dan Winston
He knew too much
He knew everything in this world and most of what is in the next
He could give you an answer to any question even if you asked him when the Judgment Day was to be
Milton Edwards was real nice and I liked him but I didnt marry him
For one thing he took a week to get a joke through his head and for another he never asked me
Horatio Reeve was the most interesting beau I ever had
But when he told a story he dressed it up so that you couldnt see it for frills
I never could decide whether he was lying or just letting his imagination run loose
And what about the others Aunty
Go away and unpack said Aunt Jamesina waving Joseph at them by mistake for a needle
The others were too nice to make fun of
I shall respect their memory
Theres a box of flowers in your room Anne
They came about an hour ago
After the first week the girls of Pattys Place settled down to a steady grind of study for this was their last year at Redmond and graduation honors must be fought for persistently
Anne devoted herself to English Priscilla pored over classics and Philippa pounded away at Mathematics
Sometimes they grew tired sometimes they felt discouraged sometimes nothing seemed worth the struggle for it
In one such mood Stella wandered up to the blue room one rainy November evening
Anne sat on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the lamp beside her amid a surrounding snow of crumpled manuscript
What in the world are you doing
Just looking over some old Story Club yarns
I wanted something to cheer AND inebriate
Id studied until the world seemed azure
So I came up here and dug these out of my trunk
They are so drenched in tears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny
Im blue and discouraged myself said Stella throwing herself on the couch
Nothing seems worthwhile
My very thoughts are old
Ive thought them all before
What is the use of living after all Anne
Honey its just brain fag that makes us feel that way and the weather
A pouring rainy night like this coming after a hard days grind would squelch any one but a Mark Tapley
You know it IS worthwhile to live
Oh I suppose so
But I cant prove it to myself just now
Just think of all the great and noble souls who have lived and worked in the world said Anne dreamily
Isnt it worthwhile to come after them and inherit what they won and taught
Isnt it worthwhile to think we can share their inspiration
And then all the great souls that will come in the future
Isnt it worthwhile to work a little and prepare the way for them  make just one step in their path easier
Oh my mind agrees with you Anne
But my soul remains doleful and uninspired
Im always grubby and dingy on rainy nights
Some nights I like the rain  I like to lie in bed and hear it pattering on the roof and drifting through the pines
I like it when it stays on the roof said Stella
It doesnt always
I spent a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer
The roof leaked and the rain came pattering down on my bed
There was no poetry in THAT
I had to get up in the mirk midnight and chivy round to pull the bedstead out of the drip  and it was one of those solid oldfashioned beds that weigh a ton  more or less
And then that dripdrop dripdrop kept up all night until my nerves just went to pieces
Youve no idea what an eerie noise a great drop of rain falling with a mushy thud on a bare floor makes in the night
It sounds like ghostly footsteps and all that sort of thing
What are you laughing over Anne
These stories
As Phil would say they are killing  in more senses than one for everybody died in them
What dazzlingly lovely heroines we had  and how we dressed them
Silks  satins  velvets  jewels  laces  they never wore anything else
Here is one of Jane Andrews stories depicting her heroine as sleeping in a beautiful white satin nightdress trimmed with seed pearls
Go on said Stella
I begin to feel that life is worth living as long as theres a laugh in it
Heres one I wrote
My heroine is disporting herself at a ball glittering from head to foot with large diamonds of the first water
But what booted beauty or rich attire
The paths of glory lead but to the grave
They must either be murdered or die of a broken heart
There was no escape for them
Let me read some of your stories
Well heres my masterpiece
Note its cheerful title  My Graves
I shed quarts of tears while writing it and the other girls shed gallons while I read it
Jane Andrews mother scolded her frightfully because she had so many handkerchiefs in the wash that week
Its a harrowing tale of the wanderings of a Methodist ministers wife
I made her a Methodist because it was necessary that she should wander
She buried a child every place she lived in
There were nine of them and their graves were severed far apart ranging from Newfoundland to Vancouver
I described the children pictured their several death beds and detailed their tombstones and epitaphs
I had intended to bury the whole nine but when I had disposed of eight my invention of horrors gave out and I permitted the ninth to live as a hopeless cripple
While Stella read My Graves punctuating its tragic paragraphs with chuckles and Rusty slept the sleep of a just cat who has been out all night curled up on a Jane Andrews tale of a beautiful maiden of fifteen who went to nurse in a leper colony  of course dying of the loathsome disease finally  Anne glanced over the other manuscripts and recalled the old days at Avonlea school when the members of the Story Club sitting under the spruce trees or down among the ferns by the brook had written them
What fun they had had
How the sunshine and mirth of those olden summers returned as she read
Not all the glory that was Greece or the grandeur that was Rome could weave such wizardry as those funny tearful tales of the Story Club
Among the manuscripts Anne found one written on sheets of wrapping paper
A wave of laughter filled her gray eyes as she recalled the time and place of its genesis
It was the sketch she had written the day she fell through the roof of the Cobb duckhouse on the Tory Road
Anne glanced over it then fell to reading it intently
It was a little dialogue between asters and sweetpeas wild canaries in the lilac bush and the guardian spirit of the garden
After she had read it she sat staring into space and when Stella had gone she smoothed out the crumpled manuscript
I believe I will she said resolutely
Chapter XXXVI The GardnersCall Here is a letter with an Indian stamp for you Aunt Jimsie said Phil
Here are three for Stella and two for Pris and a glorious fat one for me from Jo
Theres nothing for you Anne except a circular
Nobody noticed Annes flush as she took the thin letter Phil tossed her carelessly
But a few minutes later Phil looked up to see a transfigured Anne
Honey what good thing has happened
The Youths Friend has accepted a little sketch I sent them a fortnight ago said Anne trying hard to speak as if she were accustomed to having sketches accepted every mail but not quite succeeding
Anne Shirley
How glorious
What was it
When is it to be published
Did they pay you for it
Yes theyve sent a check for ten dollars and the editor writes that he would like to see more of my work
Dear man he shall
It was an old sketch I found in my box
I rewrote it and sent it in  but I never really thought it could be accepted because it had no plot said Anne recalling the bitter experience of Averils Atonement
What are you going to do with that ten dollars Anne
Lets all go up town and get drunk suggested Phil
I AM going to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort declared Anne gaily
At all events it isnt tainted money  like the check I got for that horrible Reliable Baking Powder story
I spent IT usefully for clothes and hated them every time I put them on
Think of having a real live author at Pattys Place said Priscilla
Its a great responsibility said Aunt Jamesina solemnly
Indeed it is agreed Pris with equal solemnity
Authors are kittle cattle
You never know when or how they will break out
Anne may make copy of us
I meant that the ability to write for the Press was a great responsibility said Aunt Jamesina severely
and I hope Anne realizes it
My daughter used to write stories before she went to the foreign field but now she has turned her attention to higher things
She used to say her motto was Never write a line you would be ashamed to read at your own funeral
Youd better take that for yours Anne if you are going to embark in literature
Though to be sure added Aunt Jamesina perplexedly Elizabeth always used to laugh when she said it
She always laughed so much that I dont know how she ever came to decide on being a missionary
Im thankful she did  I prayed that she might  but  I wish she hadnt
Then Aunt Jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed
Annes eyes shone all that day literary ambitions sprouted and budded in her brain their exhilaration accompanied her to Jennie Coopers walking party and not even the sight of Gilbert and Christine walking just ahead of her and Roy could quite subdue the sparkle of her starry hopes
Nevertheless she was not so rapt from things of earth as to be unable to notice that Christines walk was decidedly ungraceful
But I suppose Gilbert looks only at her face
So like a man thought Anne scornfully
Shall you be home Saturday afternoon
asked Roy
Yes
My mother and sisters are coming to call on you said Roy quietly
Something went over Anne which might be described as a thrill but it was hardly a pleasant one
She had never met any of Roys family she realized the significance of his statement and it had somehow an irrevocableness about it that chilled her
I shall be glad to see them she said flatly and then wondered if she really would be glad
She ought to be of course
But would it not be something of an ordeal
Gossip had filtered to Anne regarding the light in which the Gardners viewed the infatuation of son and brother
Roy must have brought pressure to bear in the matter of this call
Anne knew she would be weighed in the balance
From the fact that they had consented to call she understood that willingly or unwillingly they regarded her as a possible member of their clan
I shall just be myself
I shall not TRY to make a good impression thought Anne loftily
But she was wondering what dress she would better wear Saturday afternoon and if the new style of high hairdressing would suit her better than the old and the walking party was rather spoiled for her
By night she had decided that she would wear her brown chiffon on Saturday but would do her hair low
Friday afternoon none of the girls had classes at Redmond
Stella took the opportunity to write a paper for the Philomathic Society and was sitting at the table in the corner of the livingroom with an untidy litter of notes and manuscript on the floor around her
Stella always vowed she never could write anything unless she threw each sheet down as she completed it
Anne in her flannel blouse and serge skirt with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home was sitting squarely in the middle of the floor teasing the Sarahcat with a wishbone
Joseph and Rusty were both curled up in her lap
A warm plummy odor filled the whole house for Priscilla was cooking in the kitchen
Presently she came in enshrouded in a huge workapron with a smudge of flour on her nose to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced
At this auspicious moment the knocker sounded
Nobody paid any attention to it save Phil who sprang up and opened it expecting a boy with the hat she had bought that morning
On the doorstep stood Mrs Gardner and her daughters
Anne scrambled to her feet somehow emptying two indignant cats out of her lap as she did so and mechanically shifting her wishbone from her right hand to her left
Priscilla who would have had to cross the room to reach the kitchen door lost her head wildly plunged the chocolate cake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa and dashed upstairs
Stella began feverishly gathering up her manuscript
Only Aunt Jamesina and Phil remained normal
Thanks to them everybody was soon sitting at ease even Anne
Priscilla came down apronless and smudgeless Stella reduced her corner to decency and Phil saved the situation by a stream of ready small talk
Mrs Gardner was tall and thin and handsome exquisitely gowned cordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced
Aline Gardner was a younger edition of her mother lacking the cordiality
She endeavored to be nice but succeeded only in being haughty and patronizing
Dorothy Gardner was slim and jolly and rather tomboyish
Anne knew she was Roys favorite sister and warmed to her
She would have looked very much like Roy if she had had dreamy dark eyes instead of roguish hazel ones
Thanks to her and Phil the call really went off very well except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere and two rather untoward incidents
Rusty and Joseph left to themselves began a game of chase and sprang madly into Mrs Gardners silken lap and out of it in their wild career
Mrs Gardner lifted her lorgnette and gazed after their flying forms as if she had never seen cats before and Anne choking back slightly nervous laughter apologized as best she could
You are fond of cats
said Mrs Gardner with a slight intonation of tolerant wonder
Anne despite her affection for Rusty was not especially fond of cats but Mrs Gardners tone annoyed her
Inconsequently she remembered that Mrs John Blythe was so fond of cats that she kept as many as her husband would allow
They ARE adorable animals arent they
she said wickedly
I have never liked cats said Mrs Gardner remotely
I love them said Dorothy
They are so nice and selfish
Dogs are TOO good and unselfish
They make me feel uncomfortable
But cats are gloriously human
You have two delightful old china dogs there
May I look at them closely
said Aline crossing the room towards the fireplace and thereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident
Picking up Magog she sat down on the cushion under which was secreted Priscillas chocolate cake
Priscilla and Anne exchanged agonized glances but could do nothing
The stately Aline continued to sit on the cushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure
Dorothy lingered behind a moment to squeeze Annes hand and whisper impulsively
I KNOW you and I are going to be chums
Oh Roy has told me all about you
Im the only one of the family he tells things to poor boy  nobody COULD confide in mamma and Aline you know
What glorious times you girls must have here
Wont you let me come often and have a share in them
Come as often as you like Anne responded heartily thankful that one of Roys sisters was likable
She would never like Aline so much was certain and Aline would never like her though Mrs Gardner might be won
Altogether Anne sighed with relief when the ordeal was over
Of all sad words of tongue or pen The saddest are it might have been quoted Priscilla tragically lifting the cushion
This cake is now what you might call a flat failure
And the cushion is likewise ruined
Never tell me that Friday isnt unlucky
People who send word they are coming on Saturday shouldnt come on Friday said Aunt Jamesina
I fancy it was Roys mistake said Phil
That boy isnt really responsible for what he says when he talks to Anne
Where IS Anne
Anne had gone upstairs
She felt oddly like crying
But she made herself laugh instead
Rusty and Joseph had been TOO awful
And Dorothy WAS a dear
Chapter XXXVII Fullfledged BA
s I wish I were dead or that it were tomorrow night groaned Phil
If you live long enough both wishes will come true said Anne calmly
Its easy for you to be serene
Youre at home in Philosophy
Im not  and when I think of that horrible paper tomorrow I quail
If I should fail in it what would Jo say
You wont fail
How did you get on in Greek today
I dont know
Perhaps it was a good paper and perhaps it was bad enough to make Homer turn over in his grave
Ive studied and mulled over notebooks until Im incapable of forming an opinion of anything
How thankful little Phil will be when all this examinating is over
Examinating
I never heard such a word
Well havent I as good a right to make a word as any one else
demanded Phil
Words arent made  they grow said Anne
Never mind  I begin faintly to discern clear water ahead where no examination breakers loom
Girls do you  can you realize that our Redmond Life is almost over
I cant said Anne sorrowfully
It seems just yesterday that Pris and I were alone in that crowd of Freshmen at Redmond
And now we are Seniors in our final examinations
Potent wise and reverend Seniors quoted Phil
Do you suppose we really are any wiser than when we came to Redmond
You dont act as if you were by times said Aunt Jamesina severely
Oh Aunt Jimsie havent we been pretty good girls take us by and large these three winters youve mothered us
pleaded Phil
Youve been four of the dearest sweetest goodest girls that ever went together through college averred Aunt Jamesina who never spoiled a compliment by misplaced economy
But I mistrust you havent any too much sense yet
Its not to be expected of course
Experience teaches sense
You cant learn it in a college course
Youve been to college four years and I never was but I know heaps more than you do young ladies
There are lots of things that never go by rule Theres a powerful pile o knowledge That you never get at college There are heaps of things you never learn at school quoted Stella
Have you learned anything at Redmond except dead languages and geometry and such trash
queried Aunt Jamesina
Oh yes
I think we have Aunty protested Anne
Weve learned the truth of what Professor Woodleigh told us last Philomathic said Phil
He said Humor is the spiciest condiment in the feast of existence
Laugh at your mistakes but learn from them joke over your troubles but gather strength from them make a jest of your difficulties but overcome them
Isnt that worth learning Aunt Jimsie
Yes it is dearie
When youve learned to laugh at the things that should be laughed at and not to laugh at those that shouldnt youve got wisdom and understanding
What have you got out of your Redmond course Anne
murmured Priscilla aside
I think said Anne slowly that I really have learned to look upon each little hindrance as a jest and each great one as the foreshadowing of victory
Summing up I think that is what Redmond has given me
I shall have to fall back on another Professor Woodleigh quotation to express what it has done for me said Priscilla
You remember that he said in his address There is so much in the world for us all if we only have the eyes to see it and the heart to love it and the hand to gather it to ourselves  so much in men and women so much in art and literature so much everywhere in which to delight and for which to be thankful
I think Redmond has taught me that in some measure Anne
Judging from what you all say remarked Aunt Jamesina the sum and substance is that you can learn  if youve got natural gumption enough  in four years at college what it would take about twenty years of living to teach you
Well that justifies higher education in my opinion
Its a matter I was always dubious about before
But what about people who havent natural gumption Aunt Jimsie
People who havent natural gumption never learn retorted Aunt Jamesina neither in college nor life
If they live to be a hundred they really dont know anything more than when they were born
Its their misfortune not their fault poor souls
But those of us who have some gumption should duly thank the Lord for it
Will you please define what gumption is Aunt Jimsie
asked Phil
No I wont young woman
Any one who has gumption knows what it is and any one who hasnt can never know what it is
So there is no need of defining it
The busy days flew by and examinations were over
Anne took High Honors in English
Priscilla took Honors in Classics and Phil in Mathematics
Stella obtained a good allround showing
Then came Convocation
This is what I would once have called an epoch in my life said Anne as she took Roys violets out of their box and gazed at them thoughtfully
She meant to carry them of course but her eyes wandered to another box on her table
It was filled with liliesofthevalley as fresh and fragrant as those which bloomed in the Green Gables yard when June came to Avonlea
Gilbert Blythes card lay beside it
Anne wondered why Gilbert should have sent her flowers for Convocation
She had seen very little of him during the past winter
He had come to Pattys Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holidays and they rarely met elsewhere
She knew he was studying very hard aiming at High Honors and the Cooper Prize and he took little part in the social doings of Redmond
Annes own winter had been quite gay socially
She had seen a good deal of the Gardners she and Dorothy were very intimate college circles expected the announcement of her engagement to Roy any day
Anne expected it herself
Yet just before she left Pattys Place for Convocation she flung Roys violets aside and put Gilberts liliesofthevalley in their place
She could not have told why she did it
Somehow old Avonlea days and dreams and friendships seemed very close to her in this attainment of her longcherished ambitions
She and Gilbert had once picturedout merrily the day on which they should be capped and gowned graduates in Arts
The wonderful day had come and Roys violets had no place in it
Only her old friends flowers seemed to belong to this fruition of oldblossoming hopes which he had once shared
For years this day had beckoned and allured to her but when it came the one single keen abiding memory it left with her was not that of the breathless moment when the stately president of Redmond gave her cap and diploma and hailed her BA
 it was not of the flash in Gilberts eyes when he saw her lilies nor the puzzled pained glance Roy gave her as he passed her on the platform
It was not of Aline Gardners condescending congratulations or Dorothys ardent impulsive good wishes
It was of one strange unaccountable pang that spoiled this longexpected day for her and left in it a certain faint but enduring flavor of bitterness
The Arts graduates gave a graduation dance that night
When Anne dressed for it she tossed aside the pearl beads she usually wore and took from her trunk the small box that had come to Green Gables on Christmas day
In it was a threadlike gold chain with a tiny pink enamel heart as a pendant
On the accompanying card was written With all good wishes from your old chum Gilbert
Anne laughing over the memory the enamel heart conjured up the fatal day when Gilbert had called her Carrots and vainly tried to make his peace with a pink candy heart had written him a nice little note of thanks
But she had never worn the trinket
Tonight she fastened it about her white throat with a dreamy smile
She and Phil walked to Redmond together
Anne walked in silence Phil chattered of many things
Suddenly she said I heard today that Gilbert Blythes engagement to Christine Stuart was to be announced as soon as Convocation was over
Did you hear anything of it
No said Anne
I think its true said Phil lightly
Anne did not speak
In the darkness she felt her face burning
She slipped her hand inside her collar and caught at the gold chain
One energetic twist and it gave way
Anne thrust the broken trinket into her pocket
Her hands were trembling and her eyes were smarting
But she was the gayest of all the gay revellers that night and told Gilbert unregretfully that her card was full when he came to ask her for a dance
Afterwards when she sat with the girls before the dying embers at Pattys Place removing the spring chilliness from their satin skins none chatted more blithely than she of the days events
Moody Spurgeon MacPherson called here tonight after you left said Aunt Jamesina who had sat up to keep the fire on
He didnt know about the graduation dance
That boy ought to sleep with a rubber band around his head to train his ears not to stick out
I had a beau once who did that and it improved him immensely
It was I who suggested it to him and he took my advice but he never forgave me for it
Moody Spurgeon is a very serious young man yawned Priscilla
He is concerned with graver matters than his ears
He is going to be a minister you know
Well I suppose the Lord doesnt regard the ears of a man said Aunt Jamesina gravely dropping all further criticism of Moody Spurgeon
Aunt Jamesina had a proper respect for the cloth even in the case of an unfledged parson
Chapter XXXVIII False Dawn Just imagine  this night week Ill be in Avonlea  delightful thought
said Anne bending over the box in which she was packing Mrs Rachel Lyndes quilts
But just imagine  this night week Ill be gone forever from Pattys Place  horrible thought
I wonder if the ghost of all our laughter will echo through the maiden dreams of Miss Patty and Miss Maria speculated Phil
Miss Patty and Miss Maria were coming home after having trotted over most of the habitable globe
Well be back the second week in May wrote Miss Patty
I expect Pattys Place will seem rather small after the Hall of the Kings at Karnak but I never did like big places to live in
And Ill be glad enough to be home again
When you start traveling late in life youre apt to do too much of it because you know you havent much time left and its a thing that grows on you
Im afraid Maria will never be contented again
I shall leave here my fancies and dreams to bless the next comer said Anne looking around the blue room wistfully  her pretty blue room where she had spent three such happy years
She had knelt at its window to pray and had bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pines
She had heard the autumn raindrops beating against it and had welcomed the spring robins at its sill
She wondered if old dreams could haunt rooms  if when one left forever the room where she had joyed and suffered and laughed and wept something of her intangible and invisible yet nonetheless real did not remain behind like a voiceful memory
I think said Phil that a room where one dreams and grieves and rejoices and lives becomes inseparably connected with those processes and acquires a personality of its own
I am sure if I came into this room fifty years from now it would say Anne Anne to me
What nice times weve had here honey
What chats and jokes and good chummy jamborees
Oh dear me
Im to marry Jo in June and I know I will be rapturously happy
But just now I feel as if I wanted this lovely Redmond life to go on forever
Im unreasonable enough just now to wish that too admitted Anne
No matter what deeper joys may come to us later on well never again have just the same delightful irresponsible existence weve had here
Its over forever Phil
What are you going to do with Rusty
asked Phil as that privileged pussy padded into the room
I am going to take him home with me and Joseph and the Sarahcat announced Aunt Jamesina following Rusty
It would be a shame to separate those cats now that they have learned to live together
Its a hard lesson for cats and humans to learn
Im sorry to part with Rusty said Anne regretfully but it would be no use to take him to Green Gables
Marilla detests cats and Davy would tease his life out
Besides I dont suppose Ill be home very long
Ive been offered the principalship of the Summerside High School
Are you going to accept it
asked Phil
I  I havent decided yet answered Anne with a confused flush
Phil nodded understandingly
Naturally Annes plans could not be settled until Roy had spoken
He would soon  there was no doubt of that
And there was no doubt that Anne would say yes when he said Will you please
Anne herself regarded the state of affairs with a seldomruffled complacency
She was deeply in love with Roy
True it was not just what she had imagined love to be
But was anything in life Anne asked herself wearily like ones imagination of it
It was the old diamond disillusion of childhood repeated  the same disappointment she had felt when she had first seen the chill sparkle instead of the purple splendor she had anticipated
Thats not my idea of a diamond she had said
But Roy was a dear fellow and they would be very happy together even if some indefinable zest was missing out of life
When Roy came down that evening and asked Anne to walk in the park every one at Pattys Place knew what he had come to say and every one knew or thought they knew what Annes answer would be
Anne is a very fortunate girl said Aunt Jamesina
I suppose so said Stella shrugging her shoulders
Roy is a nice fellow and all that
But theres really nothing in him
That sounds very like a jealous remark Stella Maynard said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly
It does  but I am not jealous said Stella calmly
I love Anne and I like Roy
Everybody says she is making a brilliant match and even Mrs Gardner thinks her charming now
It all sounds as if it were made in heaven but I have my doubts
Make the most of that Aunt Jamesina
Roy asked Anne to marry him in the little pavilion on the harbor shore where they had talked on the rainy day of their first meeting
Anne thought it very romantic that he should have chosen that spot
And his proposal was as beautifully worded as if he had copied it as one of Ruby Gillis lovers had done out of a Deportment of Courtship and Marriage
The whole effect was quite flawless
And it was also sincere
There was no doubt that Roy meant what he said
There was no false note to jar the symphony
Anne felt that she ought to be thrilling from head to foot
But she wasnt she was horribly cool
When Roy paused for his answer she opened her lips to say her fateful yes
And then  she found herself trembling as if she were reeling back from a precipice
To her came one of those moments when we realize as by a blinding flash of illumination more than all our previous years have taught us
She pulled her hand from Roys
Oh I cant marry you  I cant  I cant she cried wildly
Roy turned pale  and also looked rather foolish
He had  small blame to him  felt very sure
What do you mean
he stammered
I mean that I cant marry you repeated Anne desperately
I thought I could  but I cant
Why cant you
Roy asked more calmly
Because  I dont care enough for you
A crimson streak came into Roys face
So youve just been amusing yourself these two years
he said slowly
No no I havent gasped poor Anne
Oh how could she explain
She COULDNT explain
There are some things that cannot be explained
I did think I cared  truly I did  but I know now I dont
You have ruined my life said Roy bitterly
Forgive me pleaded Anne miserably with hot cheeks and stinging eyes
Roy turned away and stood for a few minutes looking out seaward
When he came back to Anne he was very pale again
You can give me no hope
he said
Anne shook her head mutely
Then  goodbye said Roy
I cant understand it  I cant believe you are not the woman Ive believed you to be
But reproaches are idle between us
You are the only woman I can ever love
I thank you for your friendship at least
Goodbye Anne
Goodbye faltered Anne
When Roy had gone she sat for a long time in the pavilion watching a white mist creeping subtly and remorselessly landward up the harbor
It was her hour of humiliation and selfcontempt and shame
Their waves went over her
And yet underneath it all was a queer sense of recovered freedom
She slipped into Pattys Place in the dusk and escaped to her room
But Phil was there on the window seat
Wait said Anne flushing to anticipate the scene
Wait til you hear what I have to say
Phil Roy asked me to marry himand I refused
You  you REFUSED him
said Phil blankly
Yes
Anne Shirley are you in your senses
I think so said Anne wearily
Oh Phil dont scold me
You dont understand
I certainly dont understand
Youve encouraged Roy Gardner in every way for two years  and now you tell me youve refused him
Then youve just been flirting scandalously with him
Anne I couldnt have believed it of YOU
I WASNT flirting with him  I honestly thought I cared up to the last minute  and then  well I just knew I NEVER could marry him
I suppose said Phil cruelly that you intended to marry him for his money and then your better self rose up and prevented you
I DIDNT
I never thought about his money
Oh I cant explain it to you any more than I could to him
Well I certainly think you have treated Roy shamefully said Phil in exasperation
Hes handsome and clever and rich and good
What more do you want
I want some one who BELONGS in my life
He doesnt
I was swept off my feet at first by his good looks and knack of paying romantic compliments and later on I thought I MUST be in love because he was my darkeyed ideal
I am bad enough for not knowing my own mind but you are worse said Phil
I DO know my own mind protested Anne
The trouble is my mind changes and then I have to get acquainted with it all over again
Well I suppose there is no use in saying anything to you
There is no need Phil
Im in the dust
This has spoiled everything backwards
I can never think of Redmond days without recalling the humiliation of this evening
Roy despises me  and you despise me  and I despise myself
You poor darling said Phil melting
Just come here and let me comfort you
Ive no right to scold you
Id have married Alec or Alonzo if I hadnt met Jo
Oh Anne things are so mixedup in real life
They arent clearcut and trimmed off as they are in novels
I hope that NO one will ever again ask me to marry him as long as I live sobbed poor Anne devoutly believing that she meant it
Chapter XXXIX Deals with Weddings Anne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the first few weeks after her return to Green Gables
She missed the merry comradeship of Pattys Place
She had dreamed some brilliant dreams during the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her
In her present mood of selfdisgust she could not immediately begin dreaming again
And she discovered that while solitude with dreams is glorious solitude without them has few charms
She had not seen Roy again after their painful parting in the park pavilion but Dorothy came to see her before she left Kingsport
Im awfully sorry you wont marry Roy she said
I did want you for a sister
But you are quite right
He would bore you to death
I love him and he is a dear sweet boy but really he isnt a bit interesting
He looks as if he ought to be but he isnt
This wont spoil OUR friendship will it Dorothy
Anne had asked wistfully
No indeed
Youre too good to lose
If I cant have you for a sister I mean to keep you as a chum anyway
And dont fret over Roy
He is feeling terribly just now  I have to listen to his outpourings every day  but hell get over it
He always does
Oh  ALWAYS
said Anne with a slight change of voice
So he has got over it before
Dear me yes said Dorothy frankly
Twice before
And he raved to me just the same both times
Not that the others actually refused him  they simply announced their engagements to some one else
Of course when he met you he vowed to me that he had never really loved before  that the previous affairs had been merely boyish fancies
But I dont think you need worry
Anne decided not to worry
Her feelings were a mixture of relief and resentment
Roy had certainly told her she was the only one he had ever loved
No doubt he believed it
But it was a comfort to feel that she had not in all likelihood ruined his life
There were other goddesses and Roy according to Dorothy must needs be worshipping at some shrine
Nevertheless life was stripped of several more illusions and Anne began to think drearily that it seemed rather bare
She came down from the porch gable on the evening of her return with a sorrowful face
What has happened to the old Snow Queen Marilla
Oh I knew youd feel bad over that said Marilla
I felt bad myself
That tree was there ever since I was a young girl
It blew down in the big gale we had in March
It was rotten at the core
Ill miss it so grieved Anne
The porch gable doesnt seem the same room without it
Ill never look from its window again without a sense of loss
And oh I never came home to Green Gables before that Diana wasnt here to welcome me
Diana has something else to think of just now said Mrs Lynde significantly
Well tell me all the Avonlea news said Anne sitting down on the porch steps where the evening sunshine fell over her hair in a fine golden rain
There isnt much news except what weve wrote you said Mrs Lynde
I suppose you havent heard that Simon Fletcher broke his leg last week
Its a great thing for his family
Theyre getting a hundred things done that theyve always wanted to do but couldnt as long as he was about the old crank
He came of an aggravating family remarked Marilla
Aggravating
Well rather
His mother used to get up in prayermeeting and tell all her childrens shortcomings and ask prayers for them
Course it made them mad and worse than ever
You havent told Anne the news about Jane suggested Marilla
Oh Jane sniffed Mrs Lynde
Well she conceded grudgingly Jane Andrews is home from the West  came last week  and shes going to be married to a Winnipeg millionaire
You may be sure Mrs Harmon lost no time in telling it far and wide
Dear old Jane  Im so glad said Anne heartily
She deserves the good things of life
Oh I aint saying anything against Jane
Shes a nice enough girl
But she isnt in the millionaire class and youll find theres not much to recommend that man but his money thats what
Mrs Harmon says hes an Englishman who has made money in mines but I believe hell turn out to be a Yankee
He certainly must have money for he has just showered Jane with jewelry
Her engagement ring is a diamond cluster so big that it looks like a plaster on Janes fat paw
Mrs Lynde could not keep some bitterness out of her tone
Here was Jane Andrews that plain little plodder engaged to a millionaire while Anne it seemed was not yet bespoken by any one rich or poor
And Mrs Harmon Andrews did brag insufferably
What has Gilbert Blythe been doing to at college
asked Marilla
I saw him when he came home last week and he is so pale and thin I hardly knew him
He studied very hard last winter said Anne
You know he took High Honors in Classics and the Cooper Prize
It hasnt been taken for five years
So I think hes rather run down
Were all a little tired
Anyhow youre a BA
and Jane Andrews isnt and never will be said Mrs Lynde with gloomy satisfaction
A few evenings later Anne went down to see Jane but the latter was away in Charlottetown  getting sewing done Mrs Harmon informed Anne proudly
Of course an Avonlea dressmaker wouldnt do for Jane under the circumstances
Ive heard something very nice about Jane said Anne
Yes Jane has done pretty well even if she isnt a BA said Mrs Harmon with a slight toss of her head
Mr Inglis is worth millions and theyre going to Europe on their wedding tour
When they come back theyll live in a perfect mansion of marble in Winnipeg
Jane has only one trouble  she can cook so well and her husband wont let her cook
He is so rich he hires his cooking done
Theyre going to keep a cook and two other maids and a coachman and a manofallwork
But what about YOU Anne
I dont hear anything of your being married after all your collegegoing
Oh laughed Anne I am going to be an old maid
I really cant find any one to suit me
It was rather wicked of her
She deliberately meant to remind Mrs Andrews that if she became an old maid it was not because she had not had at least one chance of marriage
But Mrs Harmon took swift revenge
Well the overparticular girls generally get left I notice
And whats this I hear about Gilbert Blythe being engaged to a Miss Stuart
Charlie Sloane tells me she is perfectly beautiful
Is it true
I dont know if it is true that he is engaged to Miss Stuart replied Anne with Spartan composure but it is certainly true that she is very lovely
I once thought you and Gilbert would have made a match of it said Mrs Harmon
If you dont take care Anne all of your beaux will slip through your fingers
Anne decided not to continue her duel with Mrs Harmon
You could not fence with an antagonist who met rapier thrust with blow of battle axe
Since Jane is away she said rising haughtily I dont think I can stay longer this morning
Ill come down when she comes home
Do said Mrs Harmon effusively
Jane isnt a bit proud
She just means to associate with her old friends the same as ever
Shell be real glad to see you
Janes millionaire arrived the last of May and carried her off in a blaze of splendor
Mrs Lynde was spitefully gratified to find that Mr Inglis was every day of forty and short and thin and grayish
Mrs Lynde did not spare him in her enumeration of his shortcomings you may be sure
It will take all his gold to gild a pill like him thats what said Mrs Rachel solemnly
He looks kind and goodhearted said Anne loyally and Im sure he thinks the world of Jane
Humph
said Mrs Rachel
Phil Gordon was married the next week and Anne went over to Bolingbroke to be her bridesmaid
Phil made a dainty fairy of a bride and the Rev
Jo was so radiant in his happiness that nobody thought him plain
Were going for a lovers saunter through the land of Evangeline said Phil and then well settle down on Patterson Street
Mother thinks it is terrible  she thinks Jo might at least take a church in a decent place
But the wilderness of the Patterson slums will blossom like the rose for me if Jo is there
Oh Anne Im so happy my heart aches with it
Anne was always glad in the happiness of her friends but it is sometimes a little lonely to be surrounded everywhere by a happiness that is not your own
And it was just the same when she went back to Avonlea
This time it was Diana who was bathed in the wonderful glory that comes to a woman when her firstborn is laid beside her
Anne looked at the white young mother with a certain awe that had never entered into her feelings for Diana before
Could this pale woman with the rapture in her eyes be the little blackcurled rosycheeked Diana she had played with in vanished schooldays
It gave her a queer desolate feeling that she herself somehow belonged only in those past years and had no business in the present at all
Isnt he perfectly beautiful
said Diana proudly
The little fat fellow was absurdly like Fred  just as round just as red
Anne really could not say conscientiously that she thought him beautiful but she vowed sincerely that he was sweet and kissable and altogether delightful
Before he came I wanted a girl so that I could call her ANNE said Diana
But now that little Fred is here I wouldnt exchange him for a million girls
He just COULDNT have been anything but his own precious self
Every little baby is the sweetest and the best  quoted Mrs Allan gaily
If little Anne HAD come youd have felt just the same about her
Mrs Allan was visiting in Avonlea for the first time since leaving it
She was as gay and sweet and sympathetic as ever
Her old girl friends had welcomed her back rapturously
The reigning ministers wife was an estimable lady but she was not exactly a kindred spirit
I can hardly wait till he gets old enough to talk sighed Diana
I just long to hear him say mother
And oh Im determined that his first memory of me shall be a nice one
The first memory I have of my mother is of her slapping me for something I had done
I am sure I deserved it and mother was always a good mother and I love her dearly
But I do wish my first memory of her was nicer
I have just one memory of my mother and it is the sweetest of all my memories said Mrs Allan
I was five years old and I had been allowed to go to school one day with my two older sisters
When school came out my sisters went home in different groups each supposing I was with the other
Instead I had run off with a little girl I had played with at recess
We went to her home which was near the school and began making mud pies
We were having a glorious time when my older sister arrived breathless and angry
You naughty girl she cried snatching my reluctant hand and dragging me along with her
Come home this minute
Oh youre going to catch it
Mother is awful cross
She is going to give you a good whipping
I had never been whipped
Dread and terror filled my poor little heart
I have never been so miserable in my life as I was on that walk home
I had not meant to be naughty
Phemy Cameron had asked me to go home with her and I had not known it was wrong to go
And now I was to be whipped for it
When we got home my sister dragged me into the kitchen where mother was sitting by the fire in the twilight
My poor wee legs were trembling so that I could hardly stand
And mother  mother just took me up in her arms without one word of rebuke or harshness kissed me and held me close to her heart
I was so frightened you were lost darling she said tenderly
I could see the love shining in her eyes as she looked down on me
She never scolded or reproached me for what I had done  only told me I must never go away again without asking permission
She died very soon afterwards
That is the only memory I have of her
Isnt it a beautiful one
Anne felt lonelier than ever as she walked home going by way of the Birch Path and Willowmere
She had not walked that way for many moons
It was a darklypurple bloomy night
The air was heavy with blossom fragrance  almost too heavy
The cloyed senses recoiled from it as from an overfull cup
The birches of the path had grown from the fairy saplings of old to big trees
Everything had changed
Anne felt that she would be glad when the summer was over and she was away at work again
Perhaps life would not seem so empty then
Ive tried the world  it wears no more The coloring of romance it wore sighed Anne  and was straightway much comforted by the romance in the idea of the world being denuded of romance
Chapter XL A Book of Revelation The Irvings came back to Echo Lodge for the summer and Anne spent a happy three weeks there in July
Miss Lavendar had not changed Charlotta the Fourth was a very grownup young lady now but still adored Anne sincerely
When alls said and done Miss Shirley maam I havent seen any one in Boston thats equal to you she said frankly
Paul was almost grown up too
He was sixteen his chestnut curls had given place to closecropped brown locks and he was more interested in football than fairies
But the bond between him and his old teacher still held
Kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years
It was a wet bleak cruel evening in July when Anne came back to Green Gables
One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea
As Anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes
Was that Paul who brought you home
asked Marilla
Why didnt you make him stay all night
Its going to be a wild evening
Hell reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy I think
Anyway he wanted to go back tonight
Well Ive had a splendid visit but Im glad to see you dear folks again
East west hames best
Davy have you been growing again lately
Ive growed a whole inch since you left said Davy proudly
Im as tall as Milty Boulter now
Aint I glad
Hell have to stop crowing about being bigger
Say Anne did you know that Gilbert Blythe is dying
Anne stood quite silent and motionless looking at Davy
Her face had gone so white that Marilla thought she was going to faint
Davy hold your tongue said Mrs Rachel angrily
Anne dont look like that  DONT LOOK LIKE THAT
We didnt mean to tell you so suddenly
Is  it  true
asked Anne in a voice that was not hers
Gilbert is very ill said Mrs Lynde gravely
He took down with typhoid fever just after you left for Echo Lodge
Did you never hear of it
No said that unknown voice
It was a very bad case from the start
The doctor said hed been terribly run down
Theyve a trained nurse and everythings been done
DONT look like that Anne
While theres life theres hope
Mr Harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of him reiterated Davy
Marilla looking old and worn and tired got up and marched Davy grimly out of the kitchen
Oh DONT look so dear said Mrs Rachel putting her kind old arms about the pallid girl
I havent given up hope indeed I havent
Hes got the Blythe constitution in his favor thats what
Anne gently put Mrs Lyndes arms away from her walked blindly across the kitchen through the hall up the stairs to her old room
At its window she knelt down staring out unseeingly
It was very dark
The rain was beating down over the shivering fields
The Haunted Woods was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest and the air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore
And Gilbert was dying
There is a book of Revelation in every ones life as there is in the Bible
Anne read hers that bitter night as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness
She loved Gilbert  had always loved him
She knew that now
She knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her
And the knowledge had come too late  too late even for the bitter solace of being with him at the last
If she had not been so blind  so foolish  she would have had the right to go to him now
But he would never know that she loved him  he would go away from this life thinking that she did not care
Oh the black years of emptiness stretching before her
She could not live through them  she could not
She cowered down by her window and wished for the first time in her gay young life that she could die too
If Gilbert went away from her without one word or sign or message she could not live
Nothing was of any value without him
She belonged to him and he to her
In her hour of supreme agony she had no doubt of that
He did not love Christine Stuart  never had loved Christine Stuart
Oh what a fool she had been not to realize what the bond was that had held her to Gilbert  to think that the flattered fancy she had felt for Roy Gardner had been love
And now she must pay for her folly as for a crime
Mrs Lynde and Marilla crept to her door before they went to bed shook their heads doubtfully at each other over the silence and went away
The storm raged all night but when the dawn came it was spent
Anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of darkness
Soon the eastern hilltops had a fireshot ruby rim
The clouds rolled themselves away into great soft white masses on the horizon the sky gleamed blue and silvery
A hush fell over the world
Anne rose from her knees and crept downstairs
The freshness of the rainwind blew against her white face as she went out into the yard and cooled her dry burning eyes
A merry rollicking whistle was lilting up the lane
A moment later Pacifique Buote came in sight
Annes physical strength suddenly failed her
If she had not clutched at a low willow bough she would have fallen
Pacifique was George Fletchers hired man and George Fletcher lived next door to the Blythes
Mrs Fletcher was Gilberts aunt
Pacifique would know if  if  Pacifique would know what there was to be known
Pacifique strode sturdily on along the red lane whistling
He did not see Anne
She made three futile attempts to call him
He was almost past before she succeeded in making her quivering lips call Pacifique
Pacifique turned with a grin and a cheerful good morning
Pacifique said Anne faintly did you come from George Fletchers this morning
Sure said Pacifique amiably
I got de word las night dat my fader he was seeck
It was so stormy dat I couldnt go den so I start vair early dis mornin
Im goin troo de woods for short cut
Did you hear how Gilbert Blythe was this morning
Annes desperation drove her to the question
Even the worst would be more endurable than this hideous suspense
Hes better said Pacifique
He got de turn las night
De doctor say hell be all right now dis soon while
Had close shave dough
Dat boy he jus keel himself at college
Well I mus hurry
De old man hell be in hurry to see me
Pacifique resumed his walk and his whistle
Anne gazed after him with eyes where joy was driving out the strained anguish of the night
He was a very lank very ragged very homely youth
But in her sight he was as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains
Never as long as she lived would Anne see Pacifiques brown round blackeyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had given to her the oil of joy for mourning
Long after Pacifiques gay whistle had faded into the phantom of music and then into silence far up under the maples of Lovers Lane Anne stood under the willows tasting the poignant sweetness of life when some great dread has been removed from it
The morning was a cup filled with mist and glamor
In the corner near her was a rich surprise of newblown crystaldewed roses
The trills and trickles of song from the birds in the big tree above her seemed in perfect accord with her mood
A sentence from a very old very true very wonderful Book came to her lips Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
XLI Love Takes Up the Glass of Time Ive come up to ask you to go for one of our oldtime rambles through September woods and over hills where spices grow this afternoon said Gilbert coming suddenly around the porch corner
Suppose we visit Hester Grays garden
Anne sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale filmy green stuff looked up rather blankly
Oh I wish I could she said slowly but I really cant Gilbert
Im going to Alice Penhallows wedding this evening you know
Ive got to do something to this dress and by the time its finished Ill have to get ready
Im so sorry
Id love to go
Well can you go tomorrow afternoon then
asked Gilbert apparently not much disappointed
Yes I think so
In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I should otherwise have to do tomorrow
So Alice Penhallow is to be married tonight
Three weddings for you in one summer Anne  Phils Alices and Janes
Ill never forgive Jane for not inviting me to her wedding
You really cant blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews connection who had to be invited
The house could hardly hold them all
I was only bidden by grace of being Janes old chum  at least on Janes part
I think Mrs Harmons motive for inviting me was to let me see Janes surpassing gorgeousness
Is it true that she wore so many diamonds that you couldnt tell where the diamonds left off and Jane began
Anne laughed
She certainly wore a good many
What with all the diamonds and white satin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms prim little Jane was almost lost to sight
But she was VERY happy and so was Mr Inglis  and so was Mrs
Harmon
Is that the dress youre going to wear tonight
asked Gilbert looking down at the fluffs and frills
Yes
Isnt it pretty
And I shall wear starflowers in my hair
The Haunted Wood is full of them this summer
Gilbert had a sudden vision of Anne arrayed in a frilly green gown with the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair
The vision made him catch his breath
But he turned lightly away
Well Ill be up tomorrow
Hope youll have a nice time tonight
Anne looked after him as he strode away and sighed
Gilbert was friendly  very friendly  far too friendly
He had come quite often to Green Gables after his recovery and something of their old comradeship had returned
But Anne no longer found it satisfying
The rose of love made the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast
And Anne had again begun to doubt if Gilbert now felt anything for her but friendship
In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded
She was haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified
It was quite likely that it was Christine whom Gilbert loved after all
Perhaps he was even engaged to her
Anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love
She could do good if not noble work as a teacher and the success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams
But  but  Anne picked up her green dress and sighed again
When Gilbert came the next afternoon he found Anne waiting for him fresh as the dawn and fair as a star after all the gaiety of the preceding night
She wore a green dress  not the one she had worn to the wedding but an old one which Gilbert had told her at a Redmond reception he liked especially
It was just the shade of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair and the starry gray of her eyes and the irislike delicacy of her skin
Gilbert glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath thought she had never looked so lovely
Anne glancing sideways at Gilbert now and then thought how much older he looked since his illness
It was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever
The day was beautiful and the way was beautiful
Anne was almost sorry when they reached Hester Grays garden and sat down on the old bench
But it was beautiful there too  as beautiful as it had been on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and she had found it
Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely
The call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned
I think said Anne softly that the land where dreams come true is in the blue haze yonder over that little valley
Have you any unfulfilled dreams Anne
asked Gilbert
Something in his tone  something she had not heard since that miserable evening in the orchard at Pattys Place  made Annes heart beat wildly
But she made answer lightly
Of course
Everybody has
It wouldnt do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled
We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about
What a delicious aroma that lowdescending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns
I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them
Im sure they would be very beautiful
Gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked
I have a dream he said slowly
I persist in dreaming it although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true
I dream of a home with a hearthfire in it a cat and dog the footsteps of friends  and YOU
Anne wanted to speak but she could find no words
Happiness was breaking over her like a wave
It almost frightened her
I asked you a question over two years ago Anne
If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer
Still Anne could not speak
But she lifted her eyes shining with all the loverapture of countless generations and looked into his for a moment
He wanted no other answer
They lingered in the old garden until twilight sweet as dusk in Eden must have been crept over it
There was so much to talk over and recall  things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood
I thought you loved Christine Stuart Anne told him as reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved Roy Gardner
Gilbert laughed boyishly
Christine was engaged to somebody in her home town
I knew it and she knew I knew it
When her brother graduated he told me his sister was coming to Kingsport the next winter to take music and asked me if I would look after her a bit as she knew no one and would be very lonely
So I did
And then I liked Christine for her own sake
She is one of the nicest girls Ive ever known
I knew college gossip credited us with being in love with each other
I didnt care
Nothing mattered much to me for a time there after you told me you could never love me Anne
There was nobody else  there never could be anybody else for me but you
Ive loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over my head in school
I dont see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a little fool said Anne
Well I tried to stop said Gilbert frankly not because I thought you what you call yourself but because I felt sure there was no chance for me after Gardner came on the scene
But I couldnt  and I cant tell you either what its meant to me these two years to believe you were going to marry him and be told every week by some busybody that your engagement was on the point of being announced
I believed it until one blessed day when I was sitting up after the fever
I got a letter from Phil Gordon  Phil Blake rather  in which she told me there was really nothing between you and Roy and advised me to try again
Well the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that
Anne laughed  then shivered
I can never forget the night I thought you were dying Gilbert
Oh I knew  I KNEW then  and I thought it was too late
But it wasnt sweetheart
Oh Anne this makes up for everything doesnt it
Lets resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us
Its the birthday of our happiness said Anne softly
Ive always loved this old garden of Hester Grays and now it will be dearer than ever
But Ill have to ask you to wait a long time Anne said Gilbert sadly
It will be three years before Ill finish my medical course
And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls
Anne laughed
I dont want sunbursts and marble halls
I just want YOU
You see Im quite as shameless as Phil about it
Sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well but there is more scope for imagination without them
And as for the waiting that doesnt matter
Well just be happy waiting and working for each other  and dreaming
Oh dreams will be very sweet now
Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her
Then they walked home together in the dusk crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of love along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew
