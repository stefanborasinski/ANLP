Tom Grogan by F Hopkinson Smith I BABCOCKS DISCOVERY Something worried Babcock
One could see that from the impatient gesture with which he turned away from the ferry window on learning he had half an hour to wait
He paced the slip with hands deep in his pockets his head on his chest
Every now and then he stopped snapped open his watch and shut it again quickly as if to hurry the lagging minutes
For the first time in years Tom Grogan who had always unloaded his boats had failed him
A scow loaded with stone for the seawall that Babcock was building for the Lighthouse Department had lain three days at the government dock without a bucket having been swung across her decks
His foreman had just reported that there was not enough material to last the concretemixers two hours
If Grogan did not begin work at once the divers must come up
Heretofore to turn over to Grogan the unloading of material for any submarine work had been like feeding grist to a millso many tons of concrete stone loaded on the scows by the stone crushing company had meant that exact amount delivered by Grogan on Babcocks mixingplatforms twentyfour hours after arrival ready for the divers below
This was the way Grogan had worked and he had required no watching
Babcocks impatience did not cease even when he took his seat on the upper deck of the ferryboat and caught the welcome sound of the paddles sweeping back to the landing at St George
He thought of his men standing idle and of the heavy penalties which would be inflicted by the Government if the winter caught him before the section of wall was complete
It was no way to serve a man he kept repeating to himself leaving his gangs idle now when the good weather might soon be over and a full days work could never be counted upon
Earlier in the season Grogans delay would not have been so serious
But one northeaster as yet had struck the work
This had carried away some of the upper plankingthe false work of the cofferdam but this had been repaired in a few hours without delay or serious damage
After that the Indian summer had set insoft dreamy days when the winds dozed by the hour the waves nibbled along the shores and the swelling breast of the ocean rose and fell as if in gentle slumber
But would this good weather last
Babcock rose hurriedly as this anxiety again took possession of him and leaned over the deckrail scanning the sky
He did not like the drift of the low clouds off to the west southeasters began that way
It looked as though the wind might change
Some men would not have worried over these possibilities
Babcock did
He was that kind of man
When the boat touched the shore he sprang over the chains and hurried through the ferryslip
Keep an eye out sir the bridgetender called after himhe had been directing him to Grogans houseperhaps Tom may be on the road
Then it suddenly occurred to Babcock that so far as he could remember he had never seen Mr Thomas Grogan his stevedore
He knew Grogans name of course and would have recognized his signature affixed to the little cramped notes with which his orders were always acknowledged but the man himself might have passed unnoticed within three feet of him
This is not unusual where the work of a contractor lies in scattered places and he must often depend on strangers in the several localities
As he hurried over the road he recalled the face of Grogans foreman a big blond Swede and that of Grogans daughter a slender fairhaired girl who once came to the office for her fathers pay but all efforts at reviving the lineaments of Grogan failed
With this fact clear in his mind he felt a tinge of disappointment
It would have relieved his temper to unload a portion of it upon the offending stevedore
Nothing cools a mans wrath so quickly as not knowing the size of the head he intends to hit
As he approached near enough to the seawall to distinguish the swinging booms and the puffs of white steam from the hoistingengines he saw that the main derrick was at work lowering the buckets of mixed concrete to the divers
Instantly his spirits rose
The delay on his contract might not be so serious
Perhaps after all Grogan had started work
When he reached the temporary wooden fence built by the Government shutting off the view of the depot yard with its coaldocks and machineshops and neared the small door cut through its planking a voice rang out clear and strong above the din of the mixers Hold on ye walleyed macaroni
Do ye want that fall cut
Turn that snatchblock Cully and tighten up the watchtackle
Here capn lend a hand
Lively now lively before I straighten out the hull gang of ye
The voice had a ring of unquestioned authority
It was not quarrelsome or abusive or bullyingonly earnest and forceful
Ease away on that guy
Ease away I tell ye
it continued rising in intensity
Soall gone
Now haul out Cully and let that other team back up
Babcock pushed open the door in the fence and stepped in
A loaded scow lay close beside the stringpiece of the government wharf
Alongside its forward hatch was rigged a derrick with a swinging gaff
The fall led through a snatchblock in the planking of the dock and operated an iron bucket that was hoisted by a big gray horse driven by a boy
A gang of men were filling these buckets and a number of teams being loaded with their dumped contents
The captain of the scow was on the dock holding the guy
At the foot of the derrick within ten feet of Babcock stood a woman perhaps thirtyfive years of age with large clear gray eyes made all the more luminous by the deep rich color of her sunburnt skin
Her teeth were snowwhite and her light brown hair was neatly parted over a wide forehead
She wore a long ulster half concealing her wellrounded muscular figure and a black silk hood rolled back from her face the strings falling over her broad shoulders revealing a red silk scarf loosely wound about her throat the two ends tucked in her bosom
Her feet were shod in thicksoled shoes laced around her wellturned ankles and her hands were covered by buckskin gauntlets creased with wear
From the outside breastpocket of her ulster protruded a timebook from which dangled a pencil fastened to a hempen string
Every movement indicated great physical strength perfect health and a thorough control of herself and her surroundings
Coupled with this was a dignity and repose unmistakable to those who have watched the handling of large bodies of workingmen by some one leading spirit master in every tone of the voice and every gesture of the body
The woman gave Babcock a quick glance of interrogation as he entered and receiving no answer forgot him instantly
Come now ye blatherin Dagosthis time to two Italian shovelers filling the buckets shall I throw one of ye overboard to wake ye up or will I take a hand meself
Another shovel therethat buckets not half fulldrawing one hand from her side pocket and pointing with an authoritative gesture breaking as suddenly into a goodhumored laugh over the awkwardness of their movements
Babcock with all his curiosity aroused watched her for a moment forgetting for the time his own anxieties
He liked a skilled hand and he liked push and grit
This woman seemed to possess all three
He was amazed at the way in which she handled her men
He wished somebody as clearheaded and as capable were unloading his boat
He began to wonder who she might be
There was no mistaking her nationality
Slight as was her accent her direct descent from the land of the shamrock and the shillalah was not to be doubted
The very tones of her voice seemed saturated with its national spirita flower for you when you agree with me and a broken head when you dont
But underneath all these outward indications of dominant power and great physical strength he detected in the lines of the mouth and eyes a certain refinement of nature
There was too a fresh rosy wholesomeness a sweet cleanliness about the woman
These added to the noble lines of her figure would have appealed to one as beauty and only that had it not been that the firm mouth wellset chin and deep penetrating glance of the eye overpowered all other impressions
Babcock moved down beside her
Can you tell me madam where I can find Thomas Grogan
Right in front of ye she answered turning quickly with a toss of her head like that of a great hound baffled in hunt
Im Tom Grogan
What can I do for ye
Not Grogan the stevedore
Babcock asked in astonishment
Yes Grogan the stevedore
Come
Make it shortwhat can I do for ye
Then this must be my boat
I came down Yere not the boss
looking him over slowly from his feet up a goodnatured smile irradiating her face her eyes beaming every tooth glistening
Theres me hand Im glad to see ye
Ive worked for ye off and on for four years and niver laid eyes on ye till this minute
Dont say a word
I know it
Ive kept the concrete gangs back half a day but I couldnt help it
Ive had four horses down with the zooty and two men laid up with dipthery
The Big Gray Cullys drivin over therethe one thats ahoistinaint fit to be out of the stables
If ye werent behind in the work hed have two blankets on him this minute
But Im here meself now and Ill have her out tonight if I work till daylight
Here capn pull yerself together
This is the boss
Then catching sight of the boy turning a handspring behind the horse she called out again Now look here Cully none of your skylarkin
Theres the dinner whistle
Unhitch the Big Gray hes as dry as a bone
The boy loosened the traces and led the horse to water and Babcock after a word with the Captain and an encouraging smile to Tom turned away
He meant to go to the engineers office before his return to town now that his affairs with Grogan were settled
As he swung back the door in the board fence he stumbled over a mere scrap of humanity carrying a dinnerpail
The mite was peering through the crack and calling to Cully at the horsetrough
He proved to be a boy of perhaps seven or eight years of age but with the face of an old manpinched weary and scarred all over with suffering and pain
He wore a white tenniscap pulled over his eyes and a short gray jacket that reached to his waist
Under one arm was a wooden crutch
His left leg was bent at the knee and swung clear when he jerked his little body along the ground
The other though unhurt was thin and bony the yarn stocking wrinkling over the shrunken calf
Beside him stood a big billygoat harnessed to a twowheeled cart made of a soapbox
As Babcock stepped aside to let the boy pass he heard Cully shouting in answer to the little cripples cries
Cheese it Patsy
Heres Pete Lathers comin down de yard
Look out fer Stumpy
Hell have his dog on him
Patsy laid down the pail and crept through the door again drawing the crutch after him
The yardmaster passed with a bulldog at his heels and touching his hat to the contractor turned the corner of the coalshed
What is your name
said Babcock gently
A cripple always appealed to him especially a child
My names Patsy sir looking straight up into Babcocks eyes the goat nibbling at his thin hand
And who are you looking for
I come down with mothers dinner sir
Shes here working on the dock
There she is now
I thought ye were niver comin wid that dinner darlint came a womans voice
What kept ye
Stumpy was tired was he
Well niver mind
The woman lifted the little fellow in her arms pushed back his cap and smoothed his hair with her fingers her whole face beaming with tenderness
Gimme the crutch darlint and hold on to me tight and well get under the shed out of the sun till I see what Jennies sent me
At this instant she caught Babcocks eye
Oh its the boss
Sure I thought yed gone back
Pull the hat off ye me boy its the boss were workin for the man thats buildin the wall
Ye see sir when Im driv like I am today I cant go home to dinner and me Jennie sends mebigmanPatsydownrounding out each word in a pompous tone as she slipped her hand under the boys chin and kissed him on the cheek
After she had propped him between two big spars she lifted the cover of the tin pail
Pigs feet as Im alive and hot cabbage and the coffee abilin too
she said turning to the boy and pulling out a tin flask with a screw top the whole embedded in the smoking cabbage
There well be after puttin it where Stumpy cant be rubbin his nose in itsetting the pail as she spoke on a rough anchorstone
Here the goat moved up rubbing his head in the boys face and then reaching around for the pail
Look at him Patsy
Git out ye imp or Ill hurt ye
Leave that kiver alone
She laughed as she struck at the goat with her empty gauntlet and shrank back out of the way of his horns
There was no embarrassment over her informal dinner eaten as she sat squat in a fencecorner an anchorstone for a table and a pile of spars for a chair
She talked to Babcock in an unabashed selfpossessed way pouring out the smoking coffee in the flask cup chewing away on the pigs feet and throwing the bones to the goat who sniffed them contemptuously
Yes hes the youngest of our children sir
He and Jenniethats home and most as tall as meselfare all thats left
The other two went to heaven when they was little ones
Cant the little fellows leg be straightened
asked Babcock in a tone which plainly showed his sympathy for the boys suffering
No not now so Dr Mason says
There was a time when it might have been but I couldnt take him
I had him over to Quarantine again two years ago but it was too late itd growed fast they said
When he was four years old he would be under the horses heels all the time and aclimbin over them in the stable and one day the Big Gray fetched him a crack and broke his hip
He didnt mean it for hes as dacint a horse as Ive got but the boys had been aworritin him and he let drive thinkin most likely it was them
Hes been ahoistin all the mornin
Then catching sight of Cully leading the horse back to work she rose to her feet all the fire and energy renewed in her face
Shake the men up Cully
I cant give em but half an hour today
Were behind time now
And tell the capn to pull them macaronis out of the hold and start two of em to trimmin some of that stone to starboard
She was alistin when we knocked off for dinner
Come lively
II A BOARD FENCE LOSES A PLANK The work on the seawall progressed
The cofferdam which had been built by driving into the mud of the bottom a double row of heavy tongued and grooved planking in two parallel rows and bulkheading each end with heavy boards had been filled with concrete to lowwater mark consuming not only the contents of the delayed scow but two subsequent cargoes both of which had been unloaded by Tom Grogan
To keep out the leakage steampumps were kept going night and day
By dint of hard work the upper masonry of the wall had been laid to the top course ready for the coping and there was now every prospect that the last stone would be lowered into place before the winter storms set in
The shantya temporary structure good only for the life of the workrested on a set of stringers laid on extra piles driven outside of the workingplatform
When the submarine work lies miles from shore a shanty is the only shelter for the men its interior being arranged with sleepingbunks with one end partitioned off for a kitchen and a storageroom
This last is filled with perishable property extra blocks Manila rope portable forges tools shovels and barrows
For this present seawallan amphibious sort of structure with one foot on land and the other in the waterthe shanty was of light pine boards roofed over and made watertight by tarred paper
The bunks had been omitted for most of the men boarded in the village
In this way increased space for the storage of tools was gained besides room for a desk containing the government working drawings and specifications pay rolls etc
In addition to its door fastened at night with a padlock and its one glass window secured by a tenpenny nail the shanty had a flapwindow hinged at the bottom
When this was propped up with a barrel stave it made a counter from which to pay the men the paymaster standing inside
Babcock was sitting on a keg of dock spikes inside this working shanty some days after he had discovered Toms identity watching his bookkeeper preparing the payroll when a face was thrust through the square of the window
It was not a prepossessing face rather pudgy and sleek with uncertain drooping mouth and eyes that always looked over ones head when he talked
It was the property of Mr Peter Lathers the yardmaster of the depot
When youre done payin off maybe youll step outside sir he said in a confiding tone
I got a friend of mine who wants to know you
Hes a stevedore and does the work to the fort
Hes never done nothin for you but I told him next time you come down Id fetch him over
Say Dan
beckoning with his head over his shoulder then turning to BabcockI make you acquainted sir with Mr Daniel McGaw
Two faces now filled the windowLatherss and that of a redheaded man in a straw hat
All right
Ill attend to you in a moment
Glad to see you Mr McGaw said Babcock rising from the keg and looking over his bookkeepers shoulder
Latherss friend proved to be a short bigboned squareshouldered Irishman about forty years of age dressed in a once black broadcloth suit with frayed buttonholes the lapels and vest covered with greasespots
Around his collar which had done service for several days was twisted a red tie decorated with a glass pin
His face was spattered with blue powdermarks as if from some quarry explosion
A lump of a mustache dyed dark brown concealed his upper lip making all the more conspicuous the bushy sandycolored eyebrows that shaded a pair of treacherous eyes
His mouth was coarse and filled with teeth half worn off like those of an old horse
When he smiled these opened slowly like a vise
Whatever of humor played about this opening lost its life instantly when these jaws clicked together again
The hands were big and strong wrinkled and seamed their rough backs spotted like a toads the wrists covered with long spidery hairs
Babcock noticed particularly his low flat forehead when he removed his hat and the dry red hair growing close to the eyebrows
I wuz aspakin to me frind Mister Lathers about doin yer wurruk began McGaw resting one foot on a pile of barrowplanks his elbow on his knee
I does all the haulin to the foort
Surgint Duffy knows me
I wuz along here las week an see ye wuz put back fer stone
If Id had the job Id had her unloaded two days befoore
Youre dead right Dan said Lathers with an expression of disgust
This woman business aint no good nohow
She ought to be over her tubs
She does her work though Babcock said beginning to see the drift of things
Oh I dont be sayin she dont
Shes a dacint woman anough but thim bys as is arunnin her carts is raisin hll all the toime
And then look at the teams chimed in Lathers with a jerk of his thumb toward the docka lot of staggering horsecar wrecks you couldnt sell to a gluefactory
That big gray she had ahoistin is blind of an eye and sprung so forrard he cant hardly stand
At this moment the refrain of a song from somewhere near the board fence came wafting through the air And he wiped up the floor wid McGeechy
McGaw turned his head in search of the singer and not finding him resumed his position
What are your rates per ton
asked Babcock
Were achargin forty cints said McGaw deferring to Lathers as if for confirmation
Whos we
The Stevedores Union
But Mrs Grogan is doing it for thirty said Babcock looking straight into McGaws eyes and speaking slowly and deliberately
Yis I heared she wuz acuttin rates but she cant live at it
If I does it itll be done roight an no throuble
Ill think it over said Babcock quietly turning on his heel
The meanness of the whole affair offended himtwo big strong men vilifying a woman with no protector but her two hands
McGaw should never lift a shovel for him
Again the song floated out this time it seemed nearer 


wid McGeechy McGeechy of the Fourth
Dan McGaws givn it to you straight said Lathers stopping for a last word his face thrust through the window again
Hes rigged for this business and Grogan aint in it with him
If she wants her work done right she ought to send down something with a mustache
Here the song subsided in a prolonged chuckle
McGaw turned and caught sight of a boys head with its mop of black hair thrust through a crownless hat leaning over a water cask
Lathers turned too and instantly lowered his voice
The head ducked out of sight
In the flash glance Babcock caught of the face he recognized the boy Cully Patsys friend and the driver of the Big Gray
It was evident to Babcock that Cully at that moment was bubbling over with fun
Indeed this waif of the streets sometimes called James Finnegan was seldom known to be otherwise
Thets the wurrst rat in the stables said McGaw his face reddening with anger
What kin ye do whin yere abuckin agin a lot uv divils loike him
speaking through the window to Babcock
Come out uv thet he called to Cully or Ill bust yer jaw ye sneakin rat
Cully came out but not in obedience to McGaw or Lathers
Indeed he paid no more attention to either of those distinguished diplomats than if they had been two cementbarrels standing on end
His face too had lost its irradiating smile not a wrinkle or a pucker ruffled its calm surface
His claysoiled hat was in his handa very dirty hand by the way with the torn cuff of his shirt hanging loosely over it
His trousers bagged everywhereat knees seat and waist
On his stockingless feet were a pair of sunbaked brickcolored shoes
His ankles were as dark as mahogany
His throat and chest were bare the skin tanned to leather wherever the sun could work its way through the holes in his garments
From out of this combination of dust and rags shone a pair of piercing black eyes snapping with fun
I come up fer de monts pay he said coolly to Babcock the corner of his eye glued to Lathers
De ole woman said yed hev it ready
Mrs
Grogans
asked the bookkeeper shuffling over his envelopes
Yep
Tom Grogan
Can you sign the payroll
You betwith an eye still out for Lathers
Where did you learn to writeat school
asked Babcock noting the boys independence with undisguised pleasure
Naw
Patsy an me studies nights
Pop Mullins teaches ushes de ole womans farder what she brung out from Ireland
Hes alivin up ter de shebang deyre all alivin dereJinnie an de ole woman an Patsyall cept me an Carl
I bunks in wid de Big Gray
Say mister yed oughter git onter Patsyhes de little kid wid de crutch
Hes a corker he is reads potry an everythin
Wherell I sign
Oh I see in disere square hole right alongside de ole womans namespreading his elbows pen in hand and affixing James Finnegan to the collection of autographs
The next moment he was running along the dock the money envelope tight in his hand sticking out his tongue at McGaw and calling to Lathers as he disappeared through the door in the fence Sompn wid a mustache sompn wid a mustache like a newsboy calling an extra
Then a stone grazed Latherss ear
Lathers sprang through the gate but the boy was half way through the yard
It was this flealike alertness that always saved Mr Finnegans scalp
Once out of Latherss reach Cully bounded up the road like a careering letter X with arms and legs in air
If there was any one thing that delighted the boys soul it was to quote from his own picturesque vocabulary to set up a job on de ole woman
Here was his chance
Before he reached the stable he had planned the whole scene even to the exact intonation of Latherss voice when he referred to the dearth of mustaches in the Grogan household
Within a few minutes of his arrival the details of the whole occurrence word for word with such picturesque additions as his own fertile imagination could invent were common talk about the yard
Lathers meanwhile had been called upon to direct a gang of laborers who were moving an enormous iron buoyfloat down the cindercovered path to the dock
Two of the men walked beside the buoy steadying it with their hands
Lathers was leaning against the board fence of the shop whittling a stick while the others worked
Suddenly there was an angry cry for Lathers and every man stood still
So did the buoy and the moving truck
With head up eyes blazing her silk hood pushed back from her face as if to give her air her gray ulster open to her waist her right hand bare of a glove came Tom Grogan brushing the men out of her way
I knew Id find you Pete Lathers she said facing him squarely why do ye want to be takin the bread out of me childrens mouths
The stick dropped from Latherss hand Well who said I did
What have I got to do with your Youve got enough to do with em you and your friend McGaw to want em to starve
Have I ever hurt ye that ye should try an sneak me business away from me
Ye know very well the fight Ive made standin out on this dock many a day an night in the cold an wet with nothin between Toms children an the street but these two handsan yet yed slink in like a dog to get me Here now I aint agoin to have no row said Lathers twitching his shoulders
Its against orders an Ill call the yardwatch and throw you out if you make any fuss
The yardwatch
said Tom with a look of supreme contempt
I can handle any two of em an ye too an ye know it
Her cheeks were aflame
She crowded Lathers so closely his slinking figure hugged the fence
By this time the gang had abandoned the buoy and were standing aghast watching the fury of the Amazon
Now see here dont make a muss the commandantll be down here in a minute
Let him come hes the one I want to see
If he knew he had a man in his pay that would do as dirty a trick to a woman as yeve done to me his name would be Dinnis
Ill see him meself this very day and Here Lathers interrupted with an angry gesture
Dont ye lift yer arm at me she blazes out or Ill break it at the wrist
Latherss hand dropped
All the color was out of his face his lip quivering
Whoever said I said a word against you Mrs Grogan is aliar
It was the last resort of a cowardly nature
Stop lyin to me Pete Lathers
If theres anythin in this world I hate its a liar
Ye said it and ye know ye said it
Ye want that drunken loafer Dan McGaw to get me work
Yeve been at it all summer an ye think I havent watched ye but I have
And ye say I dont pay full wages and have got a lot of boys to do mens work an oughter be over me tubs
Now let me tell yeLathers shrank back cowering before herif ever I hear ye openin yer head about me or me teams or me work Ill make ye swallow every tooth in yer head
Send down somethin with a mustache will I
Theres not a man in the yard thats a match for me an ye know it
Let one of em try that
Her uplifted fist tightclenched shot past Latherss ear
A quick blow a plank knocked clear of its fastenings and a flood of daylight broke in behind Latherss head
Now the next time I come Pete Lathers she said firmly Ill miss the plank and take yer face
Then she turned and stalked out of the yard
III SERGEANT DUFFYS LITTLE GAME The bad weather so long expected finally arrived
An afternoon of soft warm autumn skies aglow with the radiance of the setting sun and brilliant in violet and gold had been followed by a cold gray morning
Of a sudden a cloud the size of a hand had mounted clear of the horizon and called together its fellows
An unseen herald in the east blew a blast and winds and sea awoke
By nine oclock a gale was blowing
By ten Babcocks men were bracing the outer sheathing of the cofferdam strengthening the derrickguys tightening the anchorlines and clearing the workingplatforms of sand cement and other damageable property
The coursemasonry fortunately was above the waterline but the coping was still unset and the rubble backing of much of the wall unfinished
Two weeks of constant work were necessary before that part of the structure contained in the first section of the contract would be entirely safe for the coming winter
Babcock doubled his gangs and utilized every hour of low water to the utmost even when the men stood waistdeep
It was his only hope for completing the first section that season
After that would come the cold freezing the mortar and ending everything
Tom Grogan performed wonders
Not only did she work her teams far into the night but during all this bad weather she stood throughout the day on the unprotected dock a mans souwester covering her head a rubber waterproof reaching to her feet
She directed every boatload herself and rushed the materials to the shovelers who stood soaking wet in the driving rain
Lathers avoided her so did McGaw
Everybody else watched her in admiration
Even the commandant a bluff graybearded naval officera hero of Hampton Roads and Memphispassed her on his morning inspection with a kindly look in his face and an aside to Babcock Hire some more like her
She is worth a dozen men
Not until the final cargo required for the completion of the wall had been dumped on the platforms did she relax her vigilance
Then she shook the water from her oilskins and started for home
During all these hours of constant strain there was no outbreak of bravado no spell of ill humor
She made no boasts or promises
With a certain buoyant pluck she stood by the derricks day after day firing volleys of criticism or encouragement as best suited the exigencies of the moment now she sprang forward to catch a sagging bucket now tended a guy to relieve a man or handled the teams herself when the line of carts was blocked or stalled
Every hour she worked increased Babcocks confidence and admiration
He began to feel a certain pride in her and to a certain extent to rely upon her
Such capacity endurance and loyalty were new in his experience
If she owed him anything for her delay on that first cargo the debt had been amply paid
Yet he saw that no such sense of obligation had influenced her
To her this extra work had been a duty he was behindhand with the wall and anxious she would help him out
As to the weather she reveled in it
The dash of the spray and the driving rain only added to her enjoyment
The clatter of rattling buckets and the rhythmic movement of the shovelers keeping time to her orders made a music as dear to her as that of the steady tramp of men and the sound of arms to a division commander
Owing to the continued bad weather and the difficulty of shipping small quantities of fuel the pumpingengines ran out of coal and a complaint from Babcocks office brought the agent of the coal company to the seawall
In times like these Babcock rarely left his work
Once let the Old Man of the Sea as he knew get his finger in between the cracks of a cofferdam and he would smash the whole into wreckage
I was on my way to see Tom Grogan said the agent
I heard you were here so I stopped to tell you about the coal
There will be a load down in the morning
I am Mr Crane of Crane  Co coaldealers
You know Mrs Grogan then
asked Babcock after the delay in the delivery of the coal had been explained
He had been waiting for some such opportunity to discover more about his stevedore
He never discussed personalities with his men
Well I should say soknown her for years
Best woman on top of Staten Island
Does she work for you
Yes and has for some years but I must confess I never knew Grogan was a woman until I found her on the dock a few weeks ago handling a cargo
She works like a machine
How long has she been a widow
Well come to think of it I dont know that she is a widow
Theres some mystery about the old man but I never knew what
But that dont count shes good enough as she is and a hustler too
Crane was something of a hustler himselfone of those busy Americans who opens his daily life with an officekey and closes it with a letter for the late mail
He was a restless wiry blackeyed little man never still for a moment and perpetually in chase of another eluding dollarwhich half the time he caught
Then laying his hand on Babcocks arm And shes square as a brick too
Sometimes when a chunker captain waiting to unload shoves a few tons aboard a sneakboat at night Tom will spot him every time
They try to fool her into indorsing their bills of lading in full but it dont work for a cent
You call her Tom Grogan
Babcock asked with a certain tone in his voice
He resented somehow Cranes familiarity
Certainly
Everybody calls her Tom Grogan
Its her husbands name
Call her anything else and she dont answer
She seems to glory in it and after you know her a while you dont want to call her anything else yourself
It comes kind of naturallike your calling a man colonel or judge
Babcock could not but admit that Crane might be right
All the names which could apply to a woman who had been sweetheart wife and mother seemed out of place when he thought of this undaunted spirit who had defied Lathers and with one blow of her fist sent the splinters of a fence flying about his head
Weve got the years contract for coal at the fort continued Crane
The quartermastersergeant who inspects itSergeant Duffyhas a friend named McGaw who wants to do the unloading into the government bins
Theres a low price on the coal and theres no margin for anybody and if Duffy should kick about the quality of the coaland you cant please these fellows if they want to be uglyCrane  Co will be in a hole and lose money on the contract
I hate to go back on Tom Grogan but theres no help for it
The ten cents a ton Id save if she hauls the coal instead of McGaw would be eaten up in Duffys short weights and rejections
I sent Sergeant Duffys letter to her so she can tell how the land lies and Im going up now to her house to see her on my way to the fort
I dont know what Duffy will get out of it perhaps he gets a few dollars out of the hauling
The coal is shipped by the way and ought to be here any minute
Wait Ill go with you said Babcock handing him an order for more coal
She hasnt sent down the tallysheet for my last scow
There was not the slightest necessity of course for Babcock to go to Grogans house for this document
As they walked on Crane talked of everything except what was uppermost in Babcocks mind
Babcock tried to lead the conversation back to Tom but Cranes thoughts were on something else
When they reached the top of the hill the noble harbor lay spread out beneath them from the purple line of the great cities to the silver sheen of the sea inside the narrows
The clearing wind had hauled to the northwest
The sky was heaped with soft clouds floating in the blue
At the base of the hill nestled the buildings and wharves of the Lighthouse Depot with the unfinished seawall running out from the shore fringed with platforms and bristling with swinging boomsthe rings of white steam twirling from the exhaustpipes
On either side of the vast basin lay two grim silent forts crouched on grassy slopes like great beasts with claws concealed
Near by big lazy steamers sullen and dull rested motionless at Quarantine awaiting inspection while beyond whitewinged graceful yachts curved tufts of foam from their bows
In the open elevators rose high as church steeples long lines of canalboats stretched themselves out like huge watersnakes with hissing tugs for heads enormous floats groaned under whole trains of cars big burly lighters drifted slowly with widespread oilstained sails monster derricks towered aloft derricks that pick up a hundredton gun as easily as an ant does a grain of sandeach floating craft made necessary by some special industry peculiar to the port of New York and each unlike any other craft in the harbor of any other city of the world
Grogans house and stables lay just over the brow of this hill in a little hollow
The house was a plain square frame dwelling with front and rear verandas protected by the arching branches of a big sycamore tree and surrounded by a small garden filled with flaming dahlias and chrysanthemums
Everything about the place was scrupulously neat and clean
The stablesthere were twostood on the lower end of the lot
They looked new or were newly painted in a dark red and appeared to have accommodations for a number of horses
The stableyard lay below the house
In its open square were a pump and a horsetrough at which two horses were drinking
One the Big Gray had his collar off showing where the sweat had discolored the skin the traces crossed loosely over his back
He was drinking eagerly and had evidently just come in from work
About under the sheds were dirtcarts tilted forward on their shafts and dustbegrimed harnesses hanging on wooden pegs
A strapping young fellow in a red shirt came out of the stable door leading two other horses to the trough
Babcock looked about him in surprise at the extent of the establishment
He had supposed that his stevedore had a small outfit and needed all the work she could get
If as McGaw had said only boys did Grogans work they at least did it well
Crane mounted the porch first and knocked
Babcock followed
No Mr Crane said a young girl opening the door shes not at home
Im expecting her every minute
Mother went to work early this morning
Shell be sorry to miss you sir
She ought to be home now for shes been up most all night at the fort
Shes just sent Carl up for two more horses
Wont you come in and wait
No Ill keep on to the fort answered Crane
I may meet her on the road
May I come in
Babcock asked explaining his business in a few words
Oh yes sir
Mother wont be long now
Youve not forgotten me Mr Babcock
Im her daughter Jennie
I was to your office once
Granpop this is the gentleman mother works for
An old man rose with some difficulty from an armchair and bowed in a kindly deferential way
He had been reading near the window
He was in his shirtsleeves his collar open at the throat
He seemed rather feeble
His legs shook as if he were weak from some recent illness
About the eyes was a certain kindliness that did not escape Babcocks quick glance they were clear and honest and looked straight into histhe kind he liked
The old mans most striking features were his silverwhite hair parted over his forehead and falling to his shoulders and his thin straight transparent nose indicating both ill health and a certain refinement and sensitiveness of nature
Had it not been for his dress he might have passed for an English curate on half pay
Me names Richard sorRichard Mullins said the old man
Im Marys father
She wont be long gone now
She promised me shed be home for dinner
He placed a chair for Babcock and remained standing
I will wait until she returns said Babcock
He had come to discover something more definite about this woman who worked like a steamengine crooned over a cripple and broke a plank with her fist and he did not intend to leave until he knew
Your daughter must have had great experience
I have never seen any one man handle work better he continued extending his hand
Then noticing that Mullins was still standing Dont let me take your seat
Mullins hesitated glanced at Jennie and moving another chair from the window drew it nearer and settled slowly beside Babcock
The room was as clean as bare arms and scrubbingbrushes could make it
Near the fireplace was a castiron stove and opposite this stood a parlor organ its top littered with photographs
A few chromos hung on the walls
There were also a big plush sofa and two haircloth rockingchairs of walnut covered with cotton tidies
The carpet on the floor was new and in the window where the old man had been sitting some pots of nasturtiums were blooming their tendrils reaching up both sides of the sash
Opening from this room was the kitchen resplendent in bright pans and a shining copper washboiler
The girl passed constantly in and out the open door spreading the cloth and bringing dishes for the table
Her girlish figure was clothed in a blue calico frock and white apron the sleeves rolled up to the elbows showing some faint traces of flour clinging to her wrists as if she had been suddenly summoned from the breadbowl
She was fresh and sweet strong and healthy with a certain grace of manner about her that pleased Babcock instantly
He saw now that she had her mothers eyes and color but not her air of fearlessness and selfreliancethat kind of selfreliance which comes only of many nights of anxiety and many days of success
He noticed too that when she spoke to the old man her voice was tempered with a peculiar tenderness as if his infirmities were more to be pitied than complained of
This pleased him most of all
You live with your daughter Mrs
Grogan
Babcock asked in a friendly way turning to the old man
Yis sor
Whin Tom got sick she sint fer me to come over an hilp her
I feeds the horses whin Oim able an looks after the garden but Oim not much good
Is Mr Thomas Grogan living
asked Babcock cautiously and with a certain tone of respect hoping to get closer to the facts and yet not to seem intrusive
Oh yis sor an moight be dead fer all the good he does
Hes in New Yorruk someers on a farmlowering his voice to a whisper and looking anxiously toward Jenniebelongin to the State I think sor
Hes hurted pretty bad an phaps hes a leetle offI dunno
Mary has niver tould me
Before Babcock could pursue the inquiry further there was a firm tread on the porch steps and the old man rose from the chair his face brightening
Here she is Granpop said Jennie laying down her dish and springing to the door
Hold tight darlint came a voice from the outside and the next instant Tom Grogan strode in her face aglow with laughter her hood awry her eyes beaming
Patsy was perched on her shoulder his little crutch fast in one hand the other tightly wound about her neck
Let go darlint yere achokin the wind out of me
Oh its ye awaitin Mr Babcockme man Carl thought yed gone
Mr Crane I met outside told me youd been here
Jenniell get the tally sheet of the last load for ye
Ive been to the fort since daylight and pretty much all night to tell ye Gods truth
Oh Granpop but I smashed em
she exclaimed as she gently removed Patsys arm and laid him in the old mans lap
She had picked the little cripple up at the garden gate where he always waited for her
Thats the last job that sneakin Duffy and Dan McGawll ever put up on me
Oh but ye shoulda minded the face on him Granpop
untying her hood and breaking into a laugh so contagious in its mirth that even Babcock joined in without knowing what it was all about
As she spoke Tom stood facing her father hood and ulster off the light of the windows silhouetting the splendid lines of her wellrounded figure with its deep chest firm bust broad back and full throat her arms swinging loose and free
Ye see she said turning to Babcock that man Duffy tried to do mehes the sergeant at the fortand Dan McGawye know himhes the divil that wanted to work for ye
Ye know I always had the hauling of the coal at the fort an I want to hold on to it for it comes every year
Ive been awatchin for this coal for a month
Every October theres a new contractor and this time it was me friend Mr Crane Ive worked for before
So I sees Duffy about it the other day an he says Well I think ye better talk to the quartermaster whos away but wholl be home next week
An that night when I got home there lay a letter from Mr Crane wid another letter inside it Sergeant Duffy had sent to Mr Crane sayin hed recommend Dan McGaw to do the stevedorinthe sneakin villainan sayin that heDuffywas agoin to inspect the coal himself an if his friend Dan McGaw hauled it the quality would be all right
Think of that
I tell ye Mr Babcock theyre divils
Then Mr Crane put down at the bottom of his letter to me that he was sorry not to give me the job but that he must give it to Duffys friend McGaw or Duffy might reject the coal
Wait till I wash me hands and Ill tell ye how I fixed him she added suddenly as with a glance at her fingers she disappeared into the kitchen reappearing a moment later with her bare arms as fresh and as rosy as her cheeks from their friction with a clean crash towel
Well
she continued I jumps into me bonnet yisterday and over I goes to the fort an I up an says to Duffy I cant wait for the quartermaster
Whens that coal acomin
An he says In a couple of weeks
An I turned onto him and says Yere a pretty loafer to take the bread out of Tom Grogans childrens mouths
An ye want Dan McGaw to do the haulin do ye
An the quality of the coalll be all right if he gits it
An theres sure to be twentyfive dollars for ye wont there
If I hear a word more out of ye Ill see Colonel Howard sure an hand him this letter
An Duffy turned white as a load of lime and says Dont do it for Gods sake
Itll cost me m place
While I was atalkin I see a chunkerboat with the very coal on it round into the dock with a tug an I ran to the stringpiece and catched the line and has her fast to a spile before the tug lost headway
Then I started for home on the run to get me derricks and stuff
I got home hooked up by twelve oclock last night an before daylight I had me rig up an the fall set and the buckets over her hatches
At six oclock this mornin I took the teams and was arunnin the coal out of the chunker when down comes MrDanielMcGaw with a gang and his big derrick on a cart
She repeated this in a mocking tone swinging her big shoulders exactly as her rival would have done
Thats me rig I says to him pintin up to the gaff an me coal an Ill throw the fust man overboard who lays hands on it
An then the sergeant come out and took McGaw one side an said somethin to him with his back to me an when McGaw turned he was white too an without sayin a word he turned the team and druv off
An just now I met Mr Crane walkin down lookin like he had lost a horse
Tom Grogan he saysI hate to disappoint ye an wouldnt for yeve always done me work well but Im stuck on the coal contract an the sergeant can put me in a hole if ye do the haulin
An I says Brace up Mr Crane theres a hole but ye aint in it an the sergeant is
Ill unload every pound of that coal if I do it for nothin and if that sneak in striped trousers bothers me or you Ill pull him apart an stamp on him
Through all her talk there was a triumphant good humor a joyousness a glow and breeziness which completely fascinated Babcock
Although she had been up half the night she was as sweet and fresh and rosy as a child
Her vitality her strength her indomitable energy impressed him as no womans had ever done before
When she had finished her story she suddenly caught Patsy out of her fathers arms and dropped with him into a chair all the motherhunger in her still unsatisfied
She smothered him with kisses and hugged him to her breast holding his pinched face against her ruddy cheek
Then she smoothed his forehead with her wellshaped hand and rocked him back and forth
By and by she told him of the stone that the Big Gray had got in his hoof down at the fort that morning and how lame he had been and how Cully had taken it out withagreatbigspikedwelling on the last words as if they belonged to some wonderful fairytale
The little fellow sat up in her lap and laughed as he patted her breast joyously with his thin hand
Cully could do it he shouted in high glee Cully can do anything
Babcock apparently made no more difference to her than if he had been an extra chair
As she moved about her rooms afterward calling to her men from the open door consulting with Jennie her arms about her neck or stopping at intervals to croon over her child she seemed to him to lose all identity with the woman on the dock
The spirit that enveloped her belonged rather to that of some royal dame of heroic times than to that of a working woman of today
The room somehow became her castle the rough stablemen her knights
On his return to his work she walked back with him part of the way
Babcock still bewildered and still consumed with curiosity to learn something of her past led the talk to her life along the docks expressing his great surprise at discovering her so capable and willing to do a mans work asking who had taught her and whether her husband in his time had been equally efficient and strong
Instantly she grew reticent
She did not even answer his question
He waited a moment and realizing his mistake turned the conversation in another direction
And how about those rough fellows around the wharvesthose who dont know youare they never coarse and brutal to you
Not when I look em in the face she answered slowly and deliberately
No man ever opens his head nor darsnt
When they see me acomin they stops talkin if its what they wouldnt want their daughters to hear an there aint no dirty back talk neither
An I make me own men civil too with a dacint tongue in their heads
I had a young strip of a lad once who would be aswearin round the stables
I told him to mend his manners or Id wash his mouth out an that I wouldnt have nobody hit me horses on the head
He kep along an I see it was a bad example for the other drivers this was only a year ago an I had three of em so when he hit the Big Gray agin I hauled off and give him a crack that laid him out
I was scared solid for two hours though they never knew it
Then with an almost piteous look in her face and with a sudden burst of confidence born doubtless of a dawning faith in the mans evident sincerity and esteem she said in a faltering tone God help me
what can I do
Ive no man to stand by me an somebodys got to be boss
IV A WALKING DELEGATE LEARNS A NEW STEP McGaws failure to undermine Toms business with Babcock and his complete discomfiture over Cranes coal contract at the fort only intensified his hatred of the woman
Finding that he could make no headway against her alone he called upon the Union to assist him claiming that she was employing nonunion labor and had thus been able to cut down the discharging rates to starvation prices
A meeting was accordingly called by the executive committee of the Knights and a resolution passed condemning certain persons in the village of Rockville as traitors to the cause of the workingman
Only one copy of this edict was issued and mailed
This found its way into Tom Grogans letterbox
Five minutes after she had broken the seal her men discovered the document pasted upside down on her stable door
McGaw heard of her action that night and started another line of attack
It was managed so skillfully that that which until then had been only a general dissatisfaction on the part of the members of the Union and their sympathizers over Toms business methods now developed into an avowed determination to crush her
They discussed several plans by which she could be compelled either to restore rates for unloading or be forced out of the business altogether
As one result of these deliberations a committee called upon the priest Father McCluskey and informed him of the delicate position in which the Union had been placed by her having hidden her husband away thus forcing them to fight the woman herself
She was making trouble they urged with her low wages and her unloading rates
Perhaps his Riverence cud straighten her out
Father McCluskeys interview with Tom took place in the priests room one morning after early mass
It had gone abroad somehow that his Reverence intended to discipline the highflyer and a considerable number of the tenementhouse gang as Tom called them had loitered behind to watch the effect of the good fathers remonstrances
What Tom told the priest no one ever knew such conferences are part of the regime of the church and go no farther
It was noticed however as she came down the aisle that her eyes were red as if from weeping and that she never raised them from the floor as she passed between her enemies on her way to the church door
Once outside she put her arm around Jennie who was waiting and the two strolled slowly across the lots to her house
When the priest came out his own eyes were tinged with moisture
He called Dennis Quigg McGaws righthand man and in a voice loud enough to be heard by those nearest him expressed his indignation that any dissension should have arisen among his people over a womans work and said that he would hear no more of this unchristian and unmanly interference with one whose only support came from the labor of her hands
McGaw and his friends were not discouraged
They were only determined upon some more definite stroke
It was therefore ordered that a committee be appointed to waylay her men going to work and inform them of their duty to their fellowlaborers
Accordingly this same Quiggsmoothshaven smirking and holloweyed with a diamond pin half a yard of watchchain and a fancy shirtexvillage clerk with his accounts short exdeputy sheriff with his accounts of cruelty and blackmail long and at present walking delegate of the Unionwas appointed a committee of one for that duty
Quigg began by begging a ride in one of Toms return carts and taking this opportunity to lay before the driver the enormity of working for Grogan for thirty dollars a month and board when there were a number of his brethren out of work and starving who would not work for less than two dollars a day if it were offered them
It was plainly the drivers duty Quigg urged to give up his job until Tom Grogan could be compelled to hire him back at advanced wages
During this enforced idleness the Union would pay the driver fifty cents a day
Here Quigg pounded his chest clenched his fists and said solemnly If capital once downs the labrin man well all be slaves
The driver was Carl Nilsson a Swede a big blueeyed lighthaired young fellow of twentytwo a sailor from boyhood who three years before on a public highway had been picked up penniless and hungry by Tom Grogan after the keeper of a sailors boardinghouse had robbed him of his years savings
The change from cracking ice from a ships deck with a marlinespike to currying and feeding something alive and warm and comfortable was so delightful to the Swede that he had given up the sea for a while
He had felt that he could ship again at anytime the water was so near
As the months went by however he too gradually fell under the spell of Toms influence
She reminded him of the great Norse women he had read about in his boyhood
Besides all this he was loyal and true to the woman who had befriended him and who had so far appreciated his devotion to her interests as to promote him from hostler and driver to foreman of the stables
Nilsson knew Quigg by sight for he had seen him walking home with Jennie from church
His knowledge of English was slight but it was enough to enable him to comprehend Quiggs purpose as he talked beside him on the cart
After some questions about how long the enforced idleness would continue he asked suddenly Who da horse clean when I go way
Dn her
let her clean it herself Quigg answered angrily
This ended the question for Nilsson and it very nearly ended the delegate
Jumping from the cart Carl picked up the shovel and sprang toward Quigg who dodged out of his way and then took to his heels
When Nilsson still white with anger reached the dock he related the incident to Cully who on his return home retailed it to Jennie with such variety of gesture and intonation that that young lady blushed scarlet but whether from sympathy for Quigg or admiration for Nilsson Cully was unable to decide
Quiggs failure to coax away one of Toms men ended active operations against Tom so far as the Union was concerned
It continued to listen to McGaws protests but with an eye open for its own interests replied that if Grogans men would not be enticed away it could at present take no further action
His trouble with Tom was an individual matter and a little patience on McGaws part was advised
The seasons work was over and nothing of importance could be done until the opening of the spring business
If Toms men struck now she would be glad to get rid of them
It would therefore be wiser to wait until she could not do without them when they might all be forced out in a body
In the interim McGaw should direct his efforts to harassing his enemy
Perhaps a word with Slattery the blacksmith might induce that worthy brother Knight to refuse to do her shoeing some morning when she was stalled for want of a horse or he might let a nail slip in a tender hoof
No one could tell what might happen in the coming months
At the moment the funds of the Union were too low for aggressive measures
Were McGaw however to make a contribution of two hundred dollars to the bank account in order to meet possible emergencies something might be done
All this was duly inscribed in the books of the committeethat is the last part of itand upon McGaws promising to do what he could toward improving the funds
It was thereupon subsequently resolved that before resorting to harsher measures the Union should do all in its power toward winning over the enemy
Brother Knight Dennis Quigg was thereupon deputed to call upon Mrs Grogan and invite her into the Union
On brother Knight Dennis Quiggs declining for private reasons the honorable mission intrusted to him by the honorable board Mr Quiggs exact words of refusal whispered in the chairmans ear were Im ajollyin one of her kittens send somebody else after the old cat another walking delegate brother Knight Crimmins by name was selected to carry out the gracious action of the committee
Crimmins had begun life as a plumbers helper had been iceman night watchman heeler and fullfledged plumber and having been out of work himself for months at a time was admirably qualified to speak of the advantages of idleness to any other candidate for like honors
He was a small man with a big nose grizzled chinwhiskers and rumandwatery eyes and wore constantly a pair of patched blue overalls as a badge of his laborship
The seat of these outside trousers showed more wear than his hands
Immediately upon his appointment Crimmins went to McGaws house to talk over the line of attack
The conference was held in the sittingroom and behind closed doorsso tightly closed that young Billy McGaw with one eye in mourning from the effect of a recent street fight was unable even by the aid of the undamaged eye and the keyhole to get the slightest inkling of what was going on inside
When the door was finally opened and McGaw and Crimmins came out they brought with them an aroma the pungency of which was explained by two empty glasses and a black bottle decorating one end of the only table in the room
As Crimmins stepped down from the broken stoop with its rusty rainspout and rotting floorplanks Billy overheard this parting remark from his father Thry the ile furst Crimmy an see what shell do thin give her the vinegar and thin with an oath ef that dont fetcher come back here to me and well give er the red pepper
Brother Knight Crimmins waved his hand to the speaker
Just leaveer to me Dan he said and started for Toms house
Crimmins was delighted with his mission
He felt sure of bringing back her application within an hour
Nothing ever pleased him so much as to work a poor woman into an agony of fright with threats of the Union
Wives and daughters had often followed him out into the street begging him to let the men alone for another week until they could pay the rent
Sometimes when he relented the more grateful would bless him for his magnanimity
This increased his selfrespect
Tom met him at the door
She had been sitting up with a sick child of Dick Todd foreman at the brewery and had just come home
Hardly a week passed without some one in distress sending for her
She had never seen Crimmins before and thought he had come to mend the roof
His first words however betrayed him The Knights sent me up to have a word wid ye
Tom made a movement as if to shut the door in his face then she paused for an instant and said curtly Come inside
Crimmins crushed his slouchhat in his hand and slunk into a chair by the window
Tom remained standing
I see ye like flowers Mrs Grogan he began in his gentlest voice
Them geraniums is the finest I iver seepeering under the leaves of the plants
Guess its cause ye water em so much
Tom made no reply
Crimmins fidgeted on his chair a little and tried another tack
I spose ye aint doin much just now weathers so bad
The roads awful goin down to the fort
Toms hands were in the side pockets of her ulster
Her face was aglow with her brisk walk from the tenements
She never took her eyes from his face and never moved a muscle of her body
She was slowly revolving in her mind whether any information she could get out of him would be worth the waiting for
Crimmins relapsed into silence and began patting the floor with his foot
The prolonged stillness was becoming uncomfortable
I was tellin ye about the meetin we had to the Union last night
We was goin over the list of members an we didnt find yer name
The board thought maybe yed like to come in wid us
The dues is only two dollars a month
Were aregulatin the prices for next year stevedorin an haulin an the ratesll be sent out next week
The stopper was now out of the oilbottle
How many members have ye got
she asked quietly
Hundred an seventythree in our branch of the Knights
All pay two dollars a month
Thats about the size of it said Crimmins
What do we git when we jine
Well we all pull togetherthats one thing
One mans strikes every mans strike
The capitalists been tryin to down us an the laborinmans got to stand together
Did ye hear about the Fertilizer Companys layin off two of our men las Friday just fer bein off a day or so without leave and their gittin a couple of scabs from Hoboken to What else do we git
said Tom in a quick imperious tone ignoring the digression
She had moved a step closer
Crimmins looked slyly up into her eyes
Until this moment he had been addressing his remarks to the brass ornament on the extreme top of the castiron stove
Toms expression of face did not reassure him in fact the steady gaze of her clear gray eye was as uncomfortable as the focused light of a sun lens
Wellwe help each other he blurted out
Do you do any helpin
Yis stiffening a little
Im the walkin delegate of our branch
Oh yere the walkin delegate
You dont pay no two dollars then do ye
No
Theres got to be somebody agoin round all the time an Dinnis Quigg and mes confidential agents of the branch an what we says goesslapping his overalls decisively with his fist
McGaws suggested stopper was being loosened on the vinegar
Toms fingers closed tightly
Her collar began to feel small
An I spose if ye said I should pay me men double wages and put up the price o haulin so high that me customers couldnt pay it so that some of yer dirty loafers could cut in an git it Id have to do it whether I wanted to or not or maybe ye think Id oughter chuck some o me own boys into the road because they dont belong to yer branch as ye call it and git a lot o dead beats to work in their places who dont know a horse from a coalbucket
An yell help me will ye
Come out here on the front porch Mr Crimminsopening the door with a jerk
Do ye see that stable over there
Well it covers seven horses an the shed has six carts with all the harness
Back of itperhaps if ye stand on yer toes even a little feller like you can see the top of another shed
That one has me derricks an tools
Crimmins tried to interrupt long enough to free McGaws red pepper but her words poured out in a torrent
Now ye can go back an tell Dan McGaw an the balance of yer twodollar loafers that there aint a dollar owin on any horse in my stable an that Ive earned everything Ive got without a man round to help cept those I pays wages to
An ye can tell em too that Ill hire who I please an pay em what they oughter git an Ill do me own haulin an unloadin fer nothin if it suits me
When ye said ye were a walkin delegate ye spoke Gods truth
Yed be a ridin delegate if ye could but theres one thing yell niver be an thats a workin delegate as long as ye kin find fools to pay ye wages fer bummin round day n night
If I had me way ye would walk but it would be on yer uppers wid yer bare feet to the road
Crimmins again attempted to speak but she raised her arm threateningly Now if its walkin ye are ye can begin right away
Let me see ye earn yer wages down that garden an into the road
Come lively now before I disgrace meself alayin hands on the likes of ye
V A WORD FROM THE TENEMENTS One morning Patsy came up the garden path limping on his crutch the little fellows eyes were full of tears
He had been out with his goat when some children from the tenements surrounded his cart pitched it into the ditch and followed him half way home calling Scab
scab
at the top of their voices
Cully heard his cries and ran through the yard to meet him his anger rising at every step
To lay hands on Patsy was to Cully the unpardonable sin
Ever since the day five years before when Tom had taken him into her employ a homeless waif of the streetshis father had been drowned from a canalboat she was unloadingand had set him down beside Patsys crib to watch while she was at her work Jennie being at school Cully had loved the little cripple with the devotion of a dog to its master
Lawless rough often cruel and sometimes vindictive as Cully was to others a word from Patsy humbled and softened him
And Patsy loved Cully
His big broad chest stout straight legs strong arms and hands were his admiration and constant pride
Cully was his champion and his ideal
The waifs recklessness and audacity were to him only evidences of so much brains and energy
This love between the lads grew stronger after Tom had sent to Dublin for her old father that she might have a man about the house
Then a new blessing came not only into the lives of both the lads but into the whole household as well
Mullins in his later years had been a dependent about Trinity College and constant association with books and students had given him a taste for knowledge denied his daughter
Tom had left home when a girl
In the long winter nights during the slack season after the stalls were bedded and the horses were fed and watered and locked up for the night the old man would draw up his chair to the big kerosene lamp on the table and tell the boys storiesthey listening with wideopen eyes Cully interrupting the narrative every now and then by such asides as No flies on them fellers wuz ther Patsy
They wuz daisies they wuz
Go on Pop its bettern a circus while Patsy would cheer aloud at the downfall of the vanquished with their three thousand lancebearers put to death by the sword waving his crutch over his head in his enthusiasm
Jennie would come in too and sit by her mother and after Nilssons encounter with Quiggan incident which greatly advanced him in Toms estimationCully would be sent to bring him in from his room over the stable and give him a chair with the others that he might learn the language easier
At these times it was delightful to watch the expression of pride and happiness that would come over Toms face as she listened to her fathers talk
But ye have a great head Granpop she would say
Cully ye blatherin idiot why dont ye brace up an git some knowledge in yer head
Sure Granpop Father McCluskey aint in it wid ye a minute
Ye could down the whole gang of em
And the old man would smile faintly and say he had heard the young gentlemen at the college recite the stories so many times he could never forget them
In this way the boys grew closer together Patsy cramming himself from books during the day in order to tell Cully at night all about the Forty Thieves boiled in oil or Ali Baba and his donkey or poor man Friday to whom Robinson Crusoe was so kind and Cully relating in return how Jimmie Finn smashed Pat Gilseys face because he threw stones at his sister ending with a full account of a dogfight which a snoozer of a cop stopped with his club
So when Patsy came limping up the garden path this morning rubbing his eyes his voice choking and the tears streaming and burying his little face in Cullys jacket poured out his tale of insult and suffering that valiant defender of the right pulled his cap tight over his eyes and began a stillhunt through the tenements
There as he afterwards expressed it he mopped up the floor with one after another of the ringleaders beginning with young Billy McGaw Dans eldest son and Cullys senior
Tom was dumfounded at the attack on Patsy
This was a blow upon which she had not counted
To strike her Patsy her cripple her baby
The cowardice of it incensed her She knew instantly that her affairs must have been common talk about the tenements to have produced so great an effect upon the children
She felt sure that their fathers and mothers had encouraged them in it
In emergencies like this it was never to the old father that she turned
He was too feeble too much a thing of the past
While to a certain extent he influenced her life standing always for the right and always for the kindest thing she could do yet when it came to times of action and danger she felt the need of a younger and more vigorous mind
It was on Jennie really more her companion than her daughter that she depended for counsel and sympathy at these times
Tom did not underestimate the gravity of the situation
Up to that point in her career she had fought only the cold the heat the many weary hours of labor far into the night and now and then some man like McGaw
But this stab from out the dark was a danger to which she was unused
She saw in this last move of McGaws aided as he was by the Union not only a determination to ruin her but a plan to divide her business among a set of men who hated her as much on account of her success as for anything else
A few more horses and carts and another barn or two and she herself would become a hated capitalist
That she had stood out in the wet and cold herself hours at a time like any man among them that she had in her husbands early days helped him feed and bed their one horse often currying him herself that when she and her Tom had moved to Rockville with their savings and there were three horses to care for and her husband needed more help than he could hire she had brought her little baby Patsy to the stable while she worked there like a man that during all this time she had cooked and washed and kept the house tidy for four people that she had done all these things she felt would not count now with the Union though each member of it was a breadwinner like herself
She knew what power it wielded
There had been the Martin family honest hardworking people who had come down from Haverstrawthe man and wife and their three childrenand moved into the new tenement with all their nice furniture and new carpets
Tom had helped them unload these things from the bricksloop that brought them
A few weeks after poor Martin still almost a stranger had been brought home from the gashouse with his head laid open because he had taken the place of a Union man discharged for drunkenness and lingered for weeks until he died
Then the widow with her children about her had been put aboard another sloop that was going back to her old home
Tom remembered as if it were yesterday the heap of furniture and little pile of kitchen things sold under the red flag outside the store near the postoffice
She had seen too the suffering and misery of her neighbors during the long strike at the brewery two years before and the moving in and out from house to tenement and tenement to shanty with never a days work afterward for any man who left his job
She had helped many of the men who three years before had been driven out of work by the majority vote of the Carpenters Union and who dared not go back and face the terrible excommunication the social boycott with all its insults and cruelties
She shuddered as she thought again of her suspicions years ago when the bucket had fallen that crushed in her husbands chest and sent him to bed for months only to leave it a wrecked man
The rope that held the bucket had been burned by acid Dr Mason said
Some grudge of the Union she had always felt was paid off then
She knew what the present trouble meant now that it was started and she knew in what it might end
But her courage never wavered
She ran over in her mind the names of the several men who were fighting herMcGaw for whom she had a contempt Dempsey and Jimmie Brown of the executive committee both liquordealers Paterson foreman of the gashouse and the restdangerous enemies she knew
That night she sent for Nilsson to come to the house heard from him word for word of Quiggs effort to corrupt him questioned Patsy closely getting the names of the children who had abused him then calling Jennie into her bedroom she locked the door behind them
When they reentered the sittingroom an hour later Jennies lips were quivering
Toms mouth was firmly set
Her mind was made up
She would fight it out to the bitter end
VI THE BIG GRAY GOES HUNGRY That invincible spirit which dwelt in Toms breastthat spirit which had dared Lathers outwitted Duffy cowed Crimmins and braved the Union did not strange to say dominate all the members of her own household
One defied her
This was no other than that despoiler of newwashed clothes old harness wagongrease timebooks and spring flowers that Arab of the open lot Stumpy the goat
This supremacy of the goat had lasted since the eventful morning when only a kid of tender days he had come into the stableyard and wobbled about on his uncertain legs nestling down near the door where Patsy lay
During all these years he had ruled over Tom
At first because his fuzzy white back and soft silky legs had been so precious to the little cripple and later because of his inexhaustible energy his aggressiveness and his marvelous activity
Brave spirits have fainted at the sight of spiders others have turned pale at lizards and some have shivered when cats crossed their paths
The only thing Tom feared on any number of legs from centipedes to men was Stumpy
Git out ye imp of Satan
she would say raising her hand when he wandered too near or Ill smash ye
The next instant she would be dodging behind the cart out of the way of Stumpys lowered horns with a scream as natural and as uncontrollable as that of a schoolgirl over a mouse
When he stood in the path cleared of snow from house to stable door with head down prepared to dispute every inch of the way with her she would tramp yards around him up to her knees in the drift rather than face his obstinate front
The basest of ingratitude actuated the goat
When the accident occurred that gained him his sobriquet and lost him his tail it was Toms quickness of hand alone that saved the remainder of his kidship from disappearing as his tail had done
Indeed she not only choked the dog who attacked him until he loosened his hold from want of breath but she threw him over the stableyard fence as an additional mark of her displeasure
In spite of her fear of him Tom never dispossessed Stumpy
That her Patsy loved him insured him his place for life
So Stumpy roamed through yard kitchen and stable stalking over bleaching sheets burglarizing the garden gate and grazing wherever he chose
The goat inspired no fear in anybody else
Jennie would chase him out of her way a dozen times a day and Cully would play bullfight with him and Carl and the other men would accord him his proper place spanking him with the flat of a shovel whenever he interfered with their daily duties or shying a corncob after him when his alertness carried him out of their reach
This afternoon Jennie had missed her bluechecked apron
It had been drying on the line outside the kitchen door five minutes before
There was no one at home but herself and she had seen nobody pass the door
Perhaps the apron had blown over into the stableyard
If it had Carl would be sure to have seen it
She knew Carl had come home she had been watching for him through the window
Then she ran in for her shawl
Carl was rubbing down the Big Gray
He had been hauling ice all the morning for the brewery
The Gray was under the cartshed a flood of winter sunlight silvering his shaggy mane and restless ears
The Swede was scraping his sides with the currycomb and the Big Gray accustomed to Cullys gentler touch was resenting the familiarity by biting at the tippet wound about the neck of the young man
Suddenly Carl raised his headhe had caught a glimpse of a flying apron whipping round the stable door
He knew the pattern
It always gave him a lump in his throat and some little creepings down his back when he saw it
Then he laid down the currycomb
The next instant there came a sound as of a barrelhead knocked in by a mixingshovel and Stumpy flew through the door followed by Carl on the run
The familiar bit of calico was Jennies lost apron
One half was inside the goat the other half was in the hand of the Swede
Carl hesitated for a moment looked cautiously about the yard and walked slowly toward the house his eyes on the fragments
He never went to the house except when he was invited either to hear Pop read or to take his dinner with the other men
At this instant Jennie came running out the shawl about her head
Oh Carl did you find my apron
It blew away and I thought it might have gone into the yard
Yas mees an da goat see it tooluke
extending the tattered fragments anger and sorrow struggling for the mastery in his face
Well I never
Carl it was a brannew one
Now just see all the strings torn off and the top gone
Im just going to give Stumpy a good beating
Carl suggested that he run after the goat and bring him back but Jennie thought he was down the road by this time and Carl had been working all the morning and must be tired
Besides she must get some wood
Carl instantly forgot the goat
He had forgotten everything indeed except the trim little body who stood before him looking into his eyes
He glowed all over with inward warmth and delight
Nobody had ever cared before whether he was tired
When he was a little fellow at home at Memlo his mother would sometimes worry about his lifting the big baskets of fish all day but he could not remember that anybody else had ever given his feelings a thought
All this flashed through his mind as he returned Jennies look
No no
I not tireI brang da wood
And then Jennie said she never meant it and Carl knew she didnt of course and then she said she had never thought of such a thing and he agreed to that and they talked so long over it standing out in the radiance of the noonday sun the color coming and going in both their facesCarl playing aimlessly with his tippet tassel and Jennie plaiting and pinching up the ruined apronthat the fire in the kitchen stove went out and the Big Gray grew hungry and craned his long neck around the shed and whinnied for Carl and even Stumpy the goat forgot his hairbreadth escape and returned near enough to the scene of the robbery to look down at it from the hill above
There is no telling how long the Big Gray would have waited if Cully had not come home to dinner bringing another horse with Patsy perched on his back
The brewery was only a short distance and Tom always gave her men a hot meal at the house whenever it was possible
Had any other horse been neglected Cully would not have cared but the Big Gray which he had driven ever since the day Tom brought him homeOld Blowhard as he would often call him the Gray was a bit wheezythe Big Gray without his dinner
Hully gee
Look at de bloke ajollying Jinnie an de Blowhard astarvin
Say Patsylifting him downhold de line till I git de Big Gray a bite
Git on ter Carl will ye
Im agointertelldebosswith a threatening air weighing each wordjes soon as she gits back
Ef I dont Im a chump
At sight of the boys Jennie darted into the house and Carl started for the stable his head in the clouds his feet on air
No I feed da horse Cullyjerking at his halter to get him away from Cully
A hell ov er lot ye will
Ill feed him meself
Hes been home an hour now an he aint half rubbed down
Carl made a grab for Cully who dodged and ran under the cart
Then a lump of ice whizzed past Carls ear
Here stop that
said Tom entering the gate
She had been in the city all the morningto look after her poor Tom Pop said
Dont ye be throwing things round here or Ill land on top of ye
Well why dont he feed de Gray den
He started afore me and dey wants de Gray down ter de brewery and he up ter de house abuzzin Jinnie
I go brang Mees Jans apron da goat eat it oop
Ye did did ye
What ye givin us
Didnt I see ye achinnin er whin I come over de hillshe aleanin up agin de fence an youse atalkin ter er an ole Blowhard cryin like his heart was broke
Eat up what apron
said Tom thoroughly mystified over the situation
Stumpy eat da apronI brang backda half ta Mees Jan An it took ye all the mornin to give it to her
said Tom thoughtfully looking Carl straight in the eye a new vista opening before her
That night when the circle gathered about the lamp to hear Pop read Carl was missing
Tom had not sent for him
VII THE CONTENTS OF CULLYS MAIL When Walking Delegate Crimmins had recovered from his amazement after his humiliating defeat at Toms hands he stood irresolute for a moment outside her garden gate indulged at some length in a form of profanity peculiar to his class and then walked direct to McGaws house
That worthy Knight met him at the door
He had been waiting for him
Young Billy McGaw also saw Crimmins enter the gate and promptly hid himself under the brokendown steps
He hoped to overhear what was going on when the two went out again
Young Billys inordinate curiosity was quite natural
He had heard enough of the current talk about the tenements and open lots to know that something of a revengeful and retaliatory nature against the Grogans was in the air but as nobody who knew the exact details had confided them to him he had determined upon an investigation of his own
He not only hated Cully but the whole Grogan household for the pounding he had received at his hands so he was anxious to get even in some way
After McGaw had locked both doors shutting out his wife and little Jack their youngest he took a bottle from the shelf filled two halftumblers and squaring himself in his chair said Did ye see her Crimmy
I did replied Crimmins swallowing the whiskey at a gulp
An shell come in wid us will she
She will will she
Shell come in nothin
I jollied her about her flowers and thought I had her dead ter rights when she up an asked me what we was agoin to do for her if she jined an afore I could tell her she opens the front door and gives me the dead cold
Fired ye
exclaimed McGaw incredulously
Im givin it to ye straight Dan an she pulled a gun on me tootelling the lie with perfect composure
That womans no slouch or I dont know em
One thing ye can bet yer bottom dollar onall h cant scare her
Weve got to try some other way
It was the peculiarly fertile quality of Crimminss imagination that made him so valuable to some of his friends
When the conspirators reached the door neither Crimmins nor his father was in a talkative mood and Billy heard nothing
They lingered a moment on the sill within a foot of his head as he lay in a cramped position below and then they sauntered out his father bareheaded to the stableyard
There McGaw leaned upon a cartwheel listening dejectedly to Crimmins who seemed to be outlining a plan of some kind which at intervals lightened the gloom of McGaws despair judging from the expression of his fathers face
Then he turned hurriedly to the house cursed his wife because he could not find his big fur cap and started across to the village
Billy followed keeping a safe distance behind
Tom after Patsys sad experience forbade him the streets and never allowed him out of her sight unless Cully or her father were with him
She knew a storm was gathering and she was watching the clouds and waiting for the first patter of rain
When it came she intended that every one of her people should be under cover
She had sent for Carl and her two stablemen and told them that if they were dissatisfied in any way she wanted to know it at once
If the wages she was paying were not enough she was willing to raise them but she wanted them distinctly to understand that as she had built up the business herself she was the only one who had a right to manage it adding that she would rather clean and drive the horses herself than be dictated to by any person outside
She said that she saw trouble brewing and knew that her men would feel it first
They must look out for themselves coming home late at night
At the brewery strike two years before hardly a day passed that some of the nonunion men were not beaten into insensibility
That night Carl came back again to the porch door and in his quiet earnest way said We have tink bout da Union
Da men not gonot laik da union man
We not fraidtapping his hippocket where sailorlike he always carried his knife sheathed in a leather case
Toms eyes kindled as she looked into his manly face
She loved pluck and grit
She knew the color of the blood running in this young fellows veins
Week after week passed and though now and then she caught the mutterings of distant thunder as Cully or some of the others overheard a remark on the ferryboat or about the postoffice no other signs of the threatened storm were visible
Then it broke
One morning an importantlooking envelope lay in her letterbox
It was long and puffy and was stamped in the upper corner with a picture of a brewery in full operation
One end bore an inscription addressed to the postmaster stating that in case Mr Thomas Grogan was not found within ten days it should be returned to Schwartz  Co Brewers
The village postoffice had several other letterboxes faced with glass so that the contents of each could be seen from the outside
Two of these contained similar envelopes looking equally important one being addressed to McGaw
When he had called for his mail the close resemblance between the two envelopes seen in the letterboxes set McGaw to thinking
Actual scrutiny through the glass revealed the picture of the brewery on each
He knew then that Tom had been asked to bid for the brewery hauling
That night a special meeting of the Union was called at eight oclock
Quigg Crimmins and McGaw signed the call
Hully gee what a wad
said Cully when the postmaster passed Toms big letter out to him
One of Cullys duties was to go for the mail
When Pop broke the seal in Toms presenceone of Pops duties was to open what Cully broughtout dropped a typewritten sheet notifying Mr Thomas Grogan that sealed proposals would be received up to March 1st for unloading hauling and delivering to the bins of the Eagle Brewery so many tons of coal and malt together with such supplies etc
There were also blank forms in duplicate to be duly filled up with the price and signature of the bidder
This contract was given out once a year
Twice before it had been awarded to Thomas Grogan
The year before a man from Stapleton had bid lowest and had done the work
McGaw and his friends complained that it took the bread out of Rockvilles mouth but as the bidder belonged to the Union no protest could be made
The morning after the meeting of the Union McGaw went to New York by the early boat
He carried a letter from Pete Lathers the yardmaster to Crane  Co of so potent a character that the coaldealers agreed to lend McGaw five hundred dollars on his threemonths note taking a chattel mortgage on his teams and carts as security the money to be paid McGaw as soon as the papers were drawn
McGaw in return was to use his pull to get a permit from the village trustees for the free use of the village dock by Crane  Co for discharging their Rockville coal
This would save Crane half a mile to haul
It was this promise made by McGaw which really turned the scale in his favor
To hustle successfully it was often necessary for Crane to cut some sharp corners
This dock as McGaw knew perfectly well had been leased to another partythe Fertilizing Companyfor two years and could not possibly be placed at Cranes disposal
But he said nothing of this to Crane
When the day of payment to McGaw arrived Dempsey of the executive committee and Walking Delegate Quigg met McGaw at the ferry on his return from New York
McGaw had Cranes money in his pocket
That night he paid two hundred dollars into the Union two hundred to his feedman on an account long overdue and the balance to Quigg in a poker game in the back room over OLearys bar
Tom also had an interview with Mr Crane shortly after his interview with McGaw
Something she said about the dock having been leased to the Fertilizing Company caused Crane to leave his chair in a hurry and ask his clerk in an angry voice if McGaw had yet been paid the money on his chattel mortgage
When his cashier showed him the stub of the check dated two days before Crane slammed the door behind him his teeth set tight little puffs of profanity escaping between the openings
As he walked with Tom to the door he said Send your papers up Tom Ill go bond any day in the year for you and for any amount but Ill get even with McGaw for that lie he told me about the dock if it takes my bank account
The annual hauling contract for the brewery which had become an important one in Rockville its business having nearly doubled in the last few years was of special value to Tom at this time and she determined to make every effort to secure it
Pop filled up the proposal in his round clear hand and Tom signed it Thomas Grogan Rockville Staten Island
Then Pop witnessed it and Mr Crane a few days later duly inscribed the firms name under the clause reserved for bondsmen
After that Tom brought the bid home and laid it on the shelf over her bed
Everything was now ready for the fight
The bids were to be opened at noon in the office of the brewery
By eleven oclock the hangerson and idlers began to lounge into the big yard paved with cobblestones
At half past eleven McGaw got out of a buggy accompanied by Quigg
At a quarter to twelve Tom in her hood and ulster walked rapidly through the gate and without as much as a look at the men gathered about the office door pushed her way into the room
Then she picked up a chair and placing it against the wall sat down
Sticking out of the breast pocket of her ulster was the big envelope containing her bid
Five minutes before the hour the men began filing in one by one awkwardly uncovering their heads and standing in one anothers way
Some using their hats as screens looked over the rims
When the bids were being gathered up by the clerk Dennis Quigg handed over McGaws
The ease with which Dan had raised the money on his notes had invested that gentleman with some of the dignity and attributes of a capitalist the hired buggy and the obsequious Quigg indicated this
His new position was strengthened by the liberal way in which he had portioned out his possessions to the workingman
It was further sustained by the hope that he might perhaps repeat his generosities in the near future
At twelve oclock precisely Mr Schwartz a round bulletheaded German entered the room turned his revolvingchair and began to cut the six envelopes heaped up before him on his desk reading the prices aloud as he opened them in succession the clerk recording
The first four were from parties in outside villages
Then came McGaws Fortynine cents for coal etc
So far he was lowest
Quigg twisted his hat nervously and McGaws coarse face grew red and white by turns
Toms bid was the last
Thomas Grogan Rockville SI thirtyeight cents for coal etc
Gentlemen said Mr Schwartz quietly Thomas Grogan gets the hauling
VIII POP MULLINSS ADVICE Almost every man and woman in the tenement district knew Oscar Schwartz and had felt the power of his obstinate hand during the long strike of two years before when the Union having declared war Schwartz had closed the brewery for several months rather than submit to its dictation
The news therefore that the Union had called a meeting and appointed a committee to wait on Mr Schwartz to protest against his giving work to a nonunion woman filled them with alarm
The women remembered the privations and suffering of that winter and the three dollars a week doled out to them by the Central Branch while their husbands who had been earning two and three dollars a day were drinking at OLearys bar playing cards or listening to the encouraging talk of the delegates who came from New York to keep up their spirits
The brewery employed a larger number of men than any other concern in Rockville so trouble with its employees meant serious trouble for half the village if Schwartz defied the Union and selected a nonunion woman to do the work
They knew too something of the indomitable pluck and endurance of Tom Grogan
If she were lowest on the bids she would fight for the contract they felt sure if it took her last dollar
McGaw was a fool they said to bid so high he might have known she would cut his throat and bring them no end of trouble
Having nursed their resentment and needing a common object for their wrath the women broke out against Tom
Many of them had disliked her ever since the day years ago when she had been seen carrying her injured husband away at night to the hospital after months of nursing at home
And the most envious had always maintained that she meant at the time to put him away forever where no one could find him so that she might play the man herself
Why should she be acomin in an arobbin us of our pay
muttered a coarse redfaced virago her hair in a frowse about her head her slatternly dress open at the throat
Oill be one to go an pull her off the dock and jump on her
Whats she adoin anyhow puttin down prices
Ef her ole man had a leg to walk on instid of his lyin today a cripple in the hospital hed be back and be arunnin things
Shes doin what shes a right to do broke out Mrs Todd indignantly
Mrs Todd was the wife of the foreman at the brewery and an old friend of Toms
Tom had sat up with her child only the week before
Indeed there were few women in the tenements for all their outcry who did not know how quick had been her hand to help when illness came or the landlord threatened the sidewalk or the undertaker insisted on his money in advance
Its not Tom Grogan thats crooked Mrs Todd continued an ye all know it
Its that loafer Dennis Quigg and that old sneak Crimmins
They never lifted their hands on a decent job in their lives an dont want to
When my man Jack was out of work for four months last winter and there wasnt a pail of coal in the house wasnt Quigg gittin his four dollars a day for shootin off his mouth every night at OLearys an fillin the mens heads full of capital and rights
An Dan McGaws no better
If yere out for jumpin on people Mrs Moriarty begin with Quigg an some of the bummers as is runnin the Union an as gits paid whether the men works or not
Bedad yere roight said half a dozen women the tide turning suddenly while the excitement grew and spread and other women came in from the several smaller tenements
Is the trouble at the brewery
asked a shrunkenlooking woman opening a door on the corridor a faded shawl over her head
She was a newcomer and had been in the tenement only a week or sonot long enough to have the run of the house or to know her neighbors
Yes at Schwartzs said Mrs Todd stopping opposite her door on the way to her own rooms
Your mans got a job there aint he
He has mum hes gatemanthe fust job in six months
Ye dont think theyll make him throw it up do ye mum
Yes an break his head if he dont
Thets what they did to my man three years gone till he had to come in with the gang and pay em two dollars a month replied Mrs Todd
But my mans jined mum a month ago they wouldnt let him work till he did
Wont ye come in an set down
Its a poor place we haveweve been so long without work an my girls laid off with a cough
Shes been aworkin at the boxfactory
If the Union give notice again I dont know whatll become of us
Cant we do somethin
Maybe Mrs Grogan might give up the work if she knew how it was wid us
She seems like a dacent woman she was in to look at me girl last week hearin as how we were strangers an she very bad
Oh ye dont know her
Ye can save yer wind and shoeleather
Shes on ter McGaw red hot thats the worst of it
He better look out shell down him yet said Mrs Todd
As the two entered the stuffy close room for further discussion a young girl left her seat by the window and moved into the adjoining apartment
She had that yellow waxy skin hollow burning eyes and hectic flush which tell the fatal story so clearly
While the women of the tenements were cursing or wringing their hands the men were devoting themselves to more vigorous measures
A meeting was called for nine oclock at Lion Hall
It was held behind closed doors
Two walking delegates from Brooklyn were present having been summoned by telegram the night before and who were expected to coax or bully the weakkneed were the ultimatum sent to Schwartz refused and an order for a sympathetic strike issued
At the brewery all was quiet
Schwartz had read the notice left on his desk by the committee the night before and had already begun his arrangements to supply the places of the men if a strike were ordered
When pressed by Quigg for a reply he said quietly The price for hauling will be Grogans bid
If she wants it it is hers
Tom talked the matter over with Pop and had determined to buy another horse and hire two extra carts
At her price there was a margin of at least ten cents a ton profit and as the work lasted through the year she could adjust the hauling of her other business without much extra expense
She discussed the situation with no one outside her house
If Schwartz wanted her to carry on the work she would do it Union or no Union
Mr Crane was on her bond
That in itself was a bracing factor
Strong and selfreliant as she was the helping hand which this man held out to her was like an anchor in a storm
That Sunday night they were all gathered round the kerosene lampPop reading Cully and Patsy on the floor Jennie listening absentmindedly her thoughts far awaywhen there came a knock at the kitchen door
Jennie flew to open it
Outside stood two women
One was Mrs Todd the other the haggard pinched careworn woman who had spoken to her that morning at her roomdoor in the tenement
They want to see you mother said Jennie all the light gone out of her eyes
What could be the matter with Carl she thought
It had been this way for a week
Well bring em in
Hold on Ill go meself
She would come Tom said Mrs Todd unwinding her shawl from her head and shoulders an ye mustnt blame me fer its none of my doins
Walk in mum ye can speak to her yerself
Why where is she
looking out of the door into the darkness
Oh here ye are I thought yed skipped
Do ye remember me
said the woman stepping into the room her gaunt face looking more wretched under the flickering light of the candle than it had done in the morning
Im the newcomer in the tenements
Ye were in to see my girl thother night
Were in great trouble
Shes not dead
said Tom sinking into a chair
No thank God weve got her still wid us but me mans come home tonight nigh crazy
Hes awalkin the floor this minute an so I goes to Mrs Todd an she come wid me
If he loses the job now were in the street
Only two weeks work since las fall an the girl gettin worse every day and every cint in the bank gone an hardly a chair lef in the place
An I says to him Ill go meself
She come in to see Katie th other night shell listen to me
We lived in Newark mum an had four rooms and a mahogany sofa and two carpets till the strike come in the clockfactory an me man had to quit an then all winteroh were not used to the likes of this
covering her face with her shawl and bursting into tears
Tom had risen to her feet her face expressing the deepest sympathy for the woman though she was at a loss to understand the cause of her visitors distress
Is yer man fired
she asked
No an wouldnt be if theyd let him alone
Hes sober an steady an never tastes a drop and brings his money home to me every Saturday night and always done an now they Well whats the matter then
Tom could not stand much beating about the bush
Why dont ye know theyve give notice
she said in astonishment then as a misgiving entered her mind Maybe Im wrong but me man an all of em tells me yere abuckin agin Mr McGaw an that ye has the haulin job at the brewery
No said Tom with emphasis yere not wrong yere dead right
But whos give notice
The committees give notice an the boss at the brewery says hell give ye the job if he has to shut up the brewery an the committees decided today that if he does theyll call out the men
My man is a member and so I come overAnd she rested her head wearily against the door the tears streaming down her face
Tom looked at her wonderingly and then putting her strong arms about her half carried her across the kitchen to a chair by the stove
Mrs Todd leaned against the table watching the sobbing woman
For a moment no one spoke
It was a new experience for Tom
Heretofore the fight had been her own and for her own
She had never supposed before that she filled so important a place in the neighborhood and for a moment there flashed across her mind a certain justifiable pride in the situation
But this feeling was momentary
Here was a suffering woman
For the first time she realized that one weaker than herself might suffer in the struggle
What could she do to help her
This thought was uppermost in her mind
Dont ye worry she said tenderly
Schwartz wont fire yer man
No but the sluggers will
There was five men pinted today to do up the scabs an the kickers who wont go out
They near killed him once in Newark for kickin
It was that time you know when Katie was first took bad
Do ye know their names
said Tom her eyes flashing
No an me man dont
Hes new an they darsnt trust him
It was in the back room he says they picked em out
Tom stood for some moments in deep thought gazing at the fire her arms akimbo
Then wheeling suddenly she opened the door of the sittingroom and said in a firm resolute voice Granpop come here I want ye
The old man laid down his book and stood in the kitchen doorway
He was in his shirtsleeves his spectacles on his forehead
Come inside the kitchen an shut that door behind ye
Heres me friend Jane Todd an a friend of hers from the tenement
That thief of a McGaw has stirred up the Union over the haulin bid and theyve sent notice to Schwartz that I dont belong to the Union an if he dont throw me over an give the job to McGaw theyll call out the men
If they do theres a hundred women and three times that many children thatll go hungry
This woman heres got a girl herself that hasnt drawed a well breath for six months an her mans been idle all winter an only just now got a job at Schwartzs tending gate
Now whatll I do
Shall I chuck up the job or stick
The old man looked into the desolate weary face of the woman and then at Tom
Then he said slowly Well child ye kin do widout it an maybe t others cant
Yeve got it straight said Tom thats just what I think meself
Then turning to the stranger Go home and tell yer man to go to bed
Ill touch nothin thatll break the heart of any woman
The jobs McGaws
Ill throw up me bid
IX WHAT A SPARROW SAW Ever since the eventful morning when Carl had neglected the Big Gray for a stolen hour with Jennie Cully had busied himself in devising ways of making the Swedes life miserable
With a boys keen insight he had discovered enough to convince him that Carl was dead mashed on Jennie as he put it but whether for keeps or not he had not yet determined
He had already enriched his songs with certain tender allusions to their present frame of mind and their future state of happiness
Where was Moses when the light went out
and Little Annie Rooney had undergone so subtle a change when sung at the top of Mr James Finnegans voice that while the original warp and woof of those very popular melodies were entirely unrecognizable to any but the persons interested to them they were as gall and wormwood
This was Cullys invariable way of expressing his opinions on current affairs
He would sit on the frontboard of his cartthe Big Gray stumbling over the stones as he walked the reins lying looseand fill the air with details of events passing in the village with all the gusto of a variety actor
The impending strike at the brewery had been made the basis of a paraphrase of Johnnie get your gun and even McGaws red head had come in for its share of abuse to the air of Fire boys fire
So for a time this new development of tenderness on the part of Carl for Jennie served to ring the changes on Moses and Annie Rooney
Carls budding hopes had been slightly nipped by the cold look in Toms eye when she asked him if it took an hour to give Jennie a tattered apron
With some disappointment he noticed that except at rare intervals and only when Tom was at home he was no longer invited to the house
He had always been a timid shrinking fellow where a woman was concerned having followed the sea and lived among men since he was sixteen years old
During these earlier years he had made two voyages in the Pacific and another to the whalingground in the Arctic seas
On this last voyage in a gale of wind he had saved all the lives aboard a brig the crew helpless from scurvy
When the lifeboat reached the lee of her stern Carl at the risk of his life climbed aboard caught a line and lowered the men one by one into the rescuing yawl
He could with perfect equanimity have faced another storm and rescued a second crew any hour of the day or night but he could not face a womans displeasure
Moreover what Tom wanted done was law to Carl
She had taken him out of the streets and given him a home
He would serve her in whatever way she wished as long as he lived
He and Granpop were fast friends
On rainy days or when work was dull in the winter months the old man would often come into Carls little chamber next the harnessroom in the stable and sit on his bed by the hour
And Carl would tell him about his people at home and show him the pictures tacked over his bed those of his old mother with her white cap and of the young sister who was soon to be married
On Sundays Carl followed Tom and her family to church waiting until they had left the house
He always sat far back near the door so that he could see them come out
Then he would overtake Pop with Patsy whenever the little fellow could go
This was not often for now there were many days when the boy had to lie all day on the lounge in the sittingroom poring over his books or playing with Stumpy brought into the kitchen to amuse him
Since the day of Toms warning look Carl rarely joined her daughter
Jennie would loiter by the way speaking to the girls but he would hang back
He felt that Tom did not want them together
One spring morning however a new complication arose
It was a morning when the sky was a delicate violetblue when the sunlight came tempered through a tender land haze and a filmy mist from the still sea when all the air was redolent with sweet smells of coming spring and all the girls were gay in new attire
Dennis Quigg had been lounging outside the church door his silk hat and green satin necktie glistening in the sun
When Jennie tripped out Quigg started forward
The look on his face as with swinging shoulders he slouched beside her sent a thrill of indignation through Carl
He could give her up perhaps if Tom insisted but never to a man like Quigg
Before the walking delegate had passed the time of day the young sailor was close beside Jennie within touch of her hand
There was no love lost between the two men
Carl had not forgotten the proposition Quigg had made to him to leave Toms employ nor had Quigg forgotten the uplifted shovel with which his proposal had been greeted
Yet there was no welldefined jealousy between them
Mr
Walking Delegate Dennis Quigg confidential agent of Branch No
3 Knights of Labor had too good an opinion of himself ever to look upon that towheaded duffer of a stableboy in the light of a rival
Nor could Carl for a moment think of that narrowchested redfaced flashily dressed Knight as being able to make the slightest impression on Mees Jan Quigg however was more than welcome to Jennie today
A little sense of wounded pride sent the hot color to her cheeks when she thought of Carls apparent neglect
He had hardly spoken to her in weeks
What had she done that he should treat her so
She would show him that there were just as good fellows about as Mr Carl Nilsson
But all this faded out when Carl joined herCarl so straight clearskinned brown and ruddy his teeth so white his eyes so blue
She could see out of the corner of her eye how the hair curled in tiny rings on his temples
Still it was to Quigg she talked
And more than that she gave him her prayerbook to carry until she fixed her glovethe glove that needed no fixing at all
And she chattered on about the dance at the boat club and the picnic which was to come off when the weather grew warmer
And Carl walked silent beside her with his head up and his heart down and the tears very near his eyes
When they reached the outer gate of the stableyard and Quigg had slouched off without even raising his hatthe absence of all courtesy stands in a certain class for a mark of higher respectCarl swung back the gate and held it open for her to pass in
Jennie loitered for a moment
There was a look in Carls face she had not seen before
She had not meant to hurt him she said to herself
What mak you no lak me anna more Mees Jan
I big annough to carry da buke said Carl
Why how you talk Carl
I never said such a word said Jennie leaning over the fence her heart fluttering
The air was soft as a caress
Opaltinted clouds with violet shadows sailed above the low hills
In the shade of the fence dandelions had burst into bloom
From a bush near by a songsparrow flung a note of spring across the meadow
Well you nev cam to stable anna more Mees Jan Carl said slowly in a tender pleading tone his gaze on her face
The girl reached through the fence for the golden flower
She dared not trust herself to look
She knew what was in her lovers eyes
I get ta flower said Carl vaulting the fence with one hand
No please dont trouble
Oh Carl
she exclaimed suddenly
The horrid brier
My hands all scratched 
Ah Mees Jan I so sorry
Let Carl see it he said his voice melting
I tak ta brier out pushing back the tangled vines of last year to bring himself nearer
The clouds sailed on
The sparrow stood on its tallest toes and twisted its little neck
Oh please do Carl it hurts so
she said laying her little round hand in the big strong horny palm that had held the lifeline the night of the wreck
The songsparrow clung to the swaying top of a mulleinstalk near by and poured out a strong swelling joyous song that wellnigh split its throat
When Tom called Jennie half an hour later she and Carl were still talking across the fence
X CULLY WINS BY A NECK About this time the labor element in the village and vicinity was startled by an advertisement in the Rockville Daily News signed by the clerk of the Board of Village Trustees notifying contractors that thirty days thereafter closing at nine PM precisely separate sealed proposals would be received at the meetingroom of the board over the postoffice for the hauling of twenty thousand cubic yards of fine crushed stone for use on the public highways bidders would be obliged to give suitable bonds etc
 certified check for five hundred dollars to accompany each bid as guaranty etc
The news was a grateful surprise to the workingmen
The hauling and placing of so large an amount of material as soon as spring opened meant plenty of work for many shovelers and pickers
The local politicians of course had known all about it for weeks especially those who owned property fronting on the streets to be improved they had helped the appropriation through the finance committee
McGaw too had known about it from the first day of its discussion before the board
Those who were inside the ring had decided then that he would be the best man to haul the stone
The steal they knew could best be arranged in the tally of the cartsthe final check on the scow measurement
They knew that McGaws accounts could be controlled and the total result easily fixed
The stone itself had been purchased of the manufacturers the year before but there were not funds enough to put it on the roads at that time
Here then was McGaws chance
His triumph at obtaining the brewery contract was but shortlived
Schwartz had given him the work but at Toms price not at his own
McGaw had accepted it hoping for profits that would help him with his chattel mortgage
After he had been at work for a month however he found that he ran behind
He began to see that in spite of its boastings the Union had really done nothing for him except indirectly with its threatened strike
The Union on the other hand insisted that it had been McGaws business to arrange his own terms with Schwartz
What it had done was to kill Grogan as a competitor and knock her nonunion men out of the job
This ended its duty
While they said this much to McGaw so far as outsiders could know the Union claimed that they had scored a brilliant victory
The Brooklyn and New York branches duly paraded it as another triumph over capital and their bank accounts were accordingly increased with new dues and collections
With this new contract in his possession McGaw felt certain he could cancel his debt with Crane and get even with the world
He began his arrangements at once
PoliceJustice Rowan the prospective candidate for the Assembly who had acquired some landed property by the purchase of expired tax titles agreed to furnish the certified check for five hundred dollars and to sign McGaws bond for a consideration to be subsequently agreed upon
A brother of Rowans a contractor who was finishing some grading at Quarantine Landing had also consented for a consideration to loan McGaw what extra teams he required
The size of the contract was so great and the deposit check and bond were so large that McGaw concluded at once that the competition would be narrowed down between himself and Rowans brother with Justice Rowan as backer and perhaps one other firm from across the island near New Brighton
His own advantage over other bidders was in his living on the spot with his stables and teams near at hand
Tom he felt assured was out of the way
Not only was the contract very much too large for her requiring twice as many carts as she possessed but now that the spring work was about to begin and Babcocks seawall work to be resumed she had all the stevedoring she could do for her own customers without going outside for additional business
Moreover she had apparently given up the fight for she had bid on no work of any kind since the morning she had called upon Schwartz and told him in her blunt frank way Give the work to McGaw at me price
Its enough and fair
Tom meanwhile made frequent visits to New York returning late at night
One day she brought home a circular with cuts of several improved kinds of hoistingengines with automatic dumpingbuckets
She showed them to Pop under the kerosene lamp at night explaining to him their advantages in handling small material like coal or broken stone
Once she so far relaxed her rules in regard to Jennies lover as to send for Carl to come to the house after supper questioning him closely about the upper rigging of a new derrick she had seen
Carls experience as a sailor was especially valuable in matters of this kind
He could not only splice a broken fall and repair the sheaves and frictionrollers in a hoistingblock but whenever the rigging got tangled aloft he could spring up the derrick like a cat and unreeve the rope in an instant
She also wrote to Babcock asking him to stop at her house some morning on his way to the Quarantine Landing where he was building a retainingwall and when he arrived she took him out to the shed where she kept her heavy derricks
That more experienced contractor at once became deeply interested and made a series of sketches for her on the back of an envelope of an improved pintle and revolvingcap which he claimed would greatly improve the working of her derricks
These sketches she took to the village blacksmith next day and by that night had an estimate of their cost
She was also seen one morning when the new trolley company got rid of its old stock at a sale of carhorses watching the prices closely and examining the condition of the animals sold
She asked the superintendent to drop her a postal when the next sale occurred
To her neighbors however and even to her own men she said nothing
The only man in the village to whom she had spoken regarding the new work was the clerk of the board and then only casually as to the exact time when the bids would be received
The day before the eventful night when the proposals were to be opened Mr Crane in his buggy stopped at her house on his way back from the fort and they drove together to the ferry
When she returned she called Pop into the kitchen shut the door and showed him the bid duly signed and a slip of pink paper
This was a check of Crane  Cos to be deposited with the bid
Then she went down to the stable and had a long conference with Cully
The village Board of Trustees consisted of nine men representing a fair average of the intelligence and honesty of the people
The president was a reputable hardware merchant a very good citizen who kept a store largely patronized by local contractors
The other members were two lawyersyoung men working up in practice with the assistance of a political pulla veterinary surgeon and five gentlemen of leisure whose only visible means of support were derived from poolrooms and ward meetings
Every man on the board except the surgeon and the president had some particular axe to grind
One wished to be sheriff another county clerk
The five gentlemen of leisure wished to stay where they were
When a pie was cut these five held the knife
It was their fault they said when they went hungry
In the side of this body politic the surgeon was a thorn as sharp as any one of his scalpels
He was a hardheaded soberminded Scotchman who had been elected to represent a group of his countrymen living in the eastern part of the village and whose profession the five supposed indicated without doubt his entire willingness to see through a cartwheel especially when the hub was silverplated
At the first meeting of the board they learned their mistake but it did not worry them much
They had seven votes to two
The councilchamber of the board was a halllarge for Rockvillesituated over the postoffice and only two doors from OLearys barroom It was the ordinary village hall used for everything from a Christmas festival to a prizefight
In summer it answered for a skatingrink
Once a month the board occupied it
On these occasions a sort of rostrum was brought in for the president besides a square table and a dozen chairs
These were placed at one end and were partitioned off by a wooden rail to form an inclosure outside of which always stood the citizens
On the wall hung a big eightday clock
Over the table about which were placed chairs a kerosene lamp swung on a brass chain
Opposite each seat lay a square of blottingpaper and some cheap pens and paper
Down the middle of the table were three inkstands standing in china plates
The board always met in the evening as the business hours of the members prevented their giving the day to their deliberations
Upon the night of the letting of the contract the first man to arrive was McGaw
He ran up the stairs hurriedly found no one he was looking for and returned to OLearys where he was joined by Justice Rowan and his brother John the contractor Quigg Crimmins and two friends of the Union
During the last week the Union was outspoken in its aid of McGaw and its men had quietly passed the word of Hands off this job
about in the neighborhood
If McGaw got the workand there was now not the slightest doubt of ithe would of course employ all Union men
If anybody else got itwell they would attend to him later
One thing was certain no scab from New Brighton should come over and take it
Theyd do up anybody who tried that game
When McGaw surrounded by his friends entered the boardroom again the place was full
Outside the rail stood a solid mass of people
Inside every seat was occupied
It was too important a meeting for any trustee to miss
McGaw stood on his toes and looked over the heads
To his delight Tom was not in the room and no one representing her
If he had had any lingering suspicion of her bidding her nonappearance allayed it
He knew now that she was out of the race
Moreover no New Brighton people had come
He whispered this information to Justice Rowans brother behind his big speckled hand covered with its red spidery hair
Then the two forced their way out again reentered the postoffice and borrowed a pen
Once there McGaw took from his side pocket two large envelopes the contents of which he spread out under the light
Im dead roight said McGaw
Ill put up the price of this other bid
There aint a man round here that dares show his head
The Unions fixed em
Will the woman bid
asked his companion
The woman
Whatd she be adoin wid a bid loike that
She cudnt handle the half of it
Ill wait till a few minutes to nine oclock
Ye kin fix up both these bids an hold em in yer pocket
Thin we kin see what bids is laid on the table
Oursll go in last
If theres nothin else well giveem the high one
Ill git inside the rail sos to be near the table
When the two squeezed back through the throng again into the boardroom even the staircase was packed
McGaw pulled off his fur cap and struggled past the rail bowing to the president
The justices brother stood outside within reach of McGaws hand
McGaw glanced at the clock and winked complacently at his prospective partnernot a single bid had been handed in
Then he thrust out his long arm took from Rowans brother the big envelope containing the higher bid and dropped it on the table
Just then there was a commotion at the door
Somebody was trying to force a passage in
The president rose from his chair and looked over the crowd
McGaw started from his chair looked anxiously at the clock then at his partner
The body of a boy struggling like an eel worked its way through the mass dodged under the wooden bar and threw an envelope on the table
Dats Tom Grogans bid he said looking at the president
Hully gee
but dat was a close shave
She telled me not ter dump it till one minute o nine an de bloke at de door come near spilin de game till I give him one in de mug
At this instant the clock struck nine and the presidents gavel fell
Times up said the Scotchman
XI A TWODOLLAR BILL The excitement over the outcome of the bidding was intense
The barroom at OLearys was filled with a motley crowd of men most of whom belonged to the Union and all of whom had hoped to profit in some way had the contract fallen into the hands of the political ring who were dominating the affairs of the village
The more hotheaded and outspoken swore vengeance not only against the horsedoctor who had refused to permit McGaw to smuggle in the second bid but against Crane  Co and everybody else who had helped to defeat their schemes
They meant to boycott Crane before tomorrow night
He should not unload or freight another cargo of coal until they allowed it
The village powers they admitted could not be boycotted but they would do everything they could to make it uncomfortable for the board if it awarded the contract to Grogan
Neither would they forget the trustees at the next election
As to that smart Alec of a horsedoctor they knew how to fix him
Suppose it had struck nine and the polls had closed what right had he to keep McGaw from handing in his other bid
Both were higher than Toms
This fact however McGaw had never mentioned
Around the tenements the interest was no less marked
Mr Moriarty had sent the news of Toms success ringing through OLearys and Mrs Moriarty waiting outside the barroom door for the pitcher her husband had filled for her inside had spread its details through every hallway in the tenement
Ah but Toms a keener said that gossip
Think of that little divil Cully jammed behind the door with her bid in his hand awaitin for the clock to get round to two minutes o nine an that big stuff Dan McGaw sittin inside wid two bids up his sleeve
Oh but shes cunnin she is
Dans clean beat
Hell niver haul a shovel o that stone
Howll she be adoin a job like that
came from a woman listening over the banisters
Be doin
rejoined a redheaded virago
Wouldnt ye be doin it yerself if ye had that big coaldealer behind ye
Oh we hear enough
Who says theyre in it
rejoined a third listener
Pete Lathers says sothe yard boss
He was atellin me man yisterday
On consulting Justice Rowan the next morning McGaw and his friends found but little comfort
The law was explicit the justice said
The contract must be given to the lowest responsible bidder
Tom had deposited her certified check of five hundred dollars with the bid and there was no informality in her proposal
He was sorry for McGaw but if Mrs Grogan signed the contract there was no hope for him
The horsedoctors action was right
If McGaws second bid had been received it would simply have invalidated both of his the law forbidding two from the same bidder
Rowans opinion sustaining Toms right was a blow he did not expect
Furthermore the justice offered no hope for the future
The law gave Tom the award and nothing could prevent her hauling the stone if she signed the contract
These words rang in McGaws earsif she signed the contract
On this if hung his only hope
Rowan was too shrewd a politician now that McGaws chances were gone to advise any departure even by a hairline from the strict letter of the law
He was moreover too upright as a justice to advise any member of the defeated party to an overt act which might look like unfairness to any bidder concerned
He had had a talk besides with his brother over night and they had accordingly determined to watch events
Should a way be found of rejecting on legal grounds Toms bid making a new advertisement necessary Rowan meant to ignore McGaw altogether and have his brother bid in his own name
This determination was strengthened when McGaw in a burst of confidence told Rowan of his present financial straits
From Rowans the complaining trio adjourned to OLearys barroom
Crimmins and McGaw entered first
Quigg arrived later
He closed one eye meaningly as he entered and OLeary handed a brass key to him over the bar with the remark Stamp on the floor three toimes Dinny an Ill send yez up what ye want to drink
Then Crimmins opened a door concealed by a wooden screen and the three disappeared upstairs
Crimmins reappeared within an hour and hurried out the front door
In a few moments he returned with Justice Rowan who had adjourned court
Immediately after the justices arrival there came three raps from the floor above and OLeary swung back the door and disappeared with an assortment of drinkables on a tray
The conference lasted until noon
Then the men separated outside the barroom
From the expression on the face of each one as he emerged from the door it was evident that the meeting had not produced any very cheering or conclusive results
McGaw had that vindictive ugly bulldog look about the eyes and mouth which always made his wife tremble when he came home
The result of the present struggle over the contract was a matter of life or death to him
His notes secured by the chattel mortgage on his live stock would be due in a few days
Crane had already notified him that they must be paid and he knew enough of his moneylender and of the anger which he had roused to know that no extension would be granted him
Losing this contract he had lost his only hope of paying them
Had it been awarded him he could have found a dozen men who would have loaned him the money to take up these notes and so to pay Crane
He had comforted himself the night before with the thought that Justice Rowan could find some way to help him out of his dilemma that the board would vote as the justice advised and then of course Toms bid would be invalidated
Now even this hope had failed him
Whoever heard of a womans doing a job for a city
he kept repeating mechanically to himself
Tom knew of none of these conspiracies
Had she done so they would not have caused her a moments anxiety
Here was a fight in which no one would suffer except the head that got in her way and she determined to hit that with all her might the moment it rose into view
This was no brewery contract she argued with Pop where five hundred men might be thrown out of employment with all the attendant suffering to women and children
The village was a power nobody could boycott
Moreover the law protected her in her rights under the award
She would therefore quietly wait until the day for signing the papers arrived furnish her bond and begin a work she could superintend herself
In the meantime she would continue her preparations
One thing she was resolved uponshe would have nothing to do with the Union
Carl could lay his hand on a dozen of his countrymen who would be glad to get employment with her
If they were all like him she need have no fear in any emergency
She bought two horsesgreat strong onesat the trolley sale and ordered two new carts from a manufacturer in Newark to be sent to her on the first of the coming month
Her friends took her good fortune less calmly
Their genuine satisfaction expressed itself in a variety of ways
Crane sent her this characteristic telegram Bully for you
Babcock came all the way down to her home to offer her his congratulations and to tender her what assistance she needed in tools or money
The Union in their deliberations insisted that it was the raised bid which had ruined the business with McGaw and for them
It was therefore McGaws duty to spare no effort to prevent her signing the contract
They had stuck by him in times gone by he must now stick by them
One point was positively insisted upon Union men must be employed on the work whoever got it
McGaw however was desperate
He denounced Tom in a vocabulary peculiar to himself and full of innuendoes and oaths but without offering any suggestion as to how his threats against her might be carried out
With his usual slyness Quigg said very little openly
He had not yet despaired of winning Jennies favor and until that hope was abandoned he could hardly make up his mind which side of the fence he was on
Crimmins was even more indifferent in regard to the outcomehis pay as walking delegate went on whichever side won he could wait
In this emergency McGaw again sought Crimminss assistance
He urged the importance of his getting the contract and he promised to make Crimmins foreman on the street and to give him a share in the profits if he would help him in some way to get the work now
The first step he argued was the necessity of crushing Tom
Everything else would be easy after that
Such a task he felt would not be altogether uncongenial to Crimmins still smarting under Toms contemptuous treatment of him the day he called upon her in his capacity of walking delegate
McGaws tempting promise made a deep impression upon Crimmins
He determined then and there to inflict some blow on Tom Grogan from which she could never recover
He was equally determined on one other thingnot to be caught
Early the next morning Crimmins stationed himself outside OLearys where he could get an uninterrupted view of two streets
He stood hunched up against the jamb of OLearys door in the attitude of a corner loafer with three parts of his body touching the woodhip shoulder and cheek
For some time no one appeared in sight either useful or inimical to his plans until Mr James Finnegan who was filling the morning air with one of his characteristic songs brightened the horizon up the street to his left
Cullys unexpected appearance at that moment produced so uncomfortable an effect upon Mr Crimmins that that gentleman fell instantly back through the barroom door
The boys quick eye caught the movement and it also caught a moment later Mr Crimminss nose and watery eye peering out again when their owner had assured himself that his escape had been unseen
Cully slackened his pace to see what new move Crimmins would makebut without the slightest sign of recognition on his faceand again broke into song
He was on his way to get the mail and had passed McGaws house but a few moments before in the hope that that worthy Knight might be either leaning over the fence or seated on the brokendown porch
He was anxious McGaw should hear a few improvised stanzas of a new ballad he had composed to that delightful old negro melody Massas in de cold cold ground in which the muchbeloved Southern planter and the thoroughly hated McGaw changed places in the cemetery
That valiant Knight was still in bed exhausted by the labors of the previous evening
Young Billy however was about the stables and so Mr James Finnegan took occasion to tarry long enough in the road for the eldest son of his enemy to get the stanza by heart in the hope that he might retail it to his father when he appeared
Billy dropped his manurefork as soon as Cully had moved on again and dodging behind the fence followed him toward the postoffice hoping to hit the singer with a stone
When the slinking body of McGaws eldest son became visible to Mr Crimmins his face broke into creases so nearly imitative of a smile that his best friend would not have known him
He slapped the patched knees of his overalls gayly bent over in a subdued chuckle and disported himself in a merry and much satisfied way
His rumandwatery eyes gleamed with delight and even his chinwhisker took on a new vibration
Next he laid one finger along his nose looked about him cautiously and said to himself in an undertone The very boy
Itll fix McGaw dead to rights an ther wont be no squealin after its done
Here he peered around the edge of one of OLearys drawn windowshades and waited until Cully had passed the barroom secured his mail and started for home his uninterrupted song filling the air
Then he opened the blind very cautiously and beckoned to Billy
Cullys eye caught the new movement as he turned the corner
His song ceased
When Mr Finnegan had anything very serious on his mind he never sang
When some time after Billy emerged from OLearys door he had a twodollar bill tightly squeezed in his right hand
Part of this he spent on his way home for a box of cigarettes the balance he invested in a mysteriouslooking tin can
The can was narrow and long and had a screw nozzle at one end
This can Cully saw him hide in a corner of his fathers stable
XII CULLYS NIGHT OUT Ever since the night Cully with the news of the hairbreadth escape of the bid had dashed back to Tom waiting around the corner he had been the hero of the hour
As she listened to his description of McGaw when her bid dropped on the tableLookin like hed eat sumpin he couldnt swallersee
her face was radiant and her sides shook with laughter
She had counted upon McGaw falling into her trap and she was delighted over the success of her experiment
Tom had once before caught him raising a bid when he discovered that but one had been offered
In recognition of these valuable services Tom had given Cully two tickets for a circus which was then charming the inhabitants of New Brighton a mile or more away and he and Carl were going the following night
Mr Finnegan was to wear a black sackcoat a derby hat and a white shirt which Jennie in the goodness of her heart had ironed for him herself
She had also ironed a scarf of Carls and had laid it on the windowsill of the outer kitchen where Cully might find it as he passed by
The walks home from church were now about the only chance the lovers had of being together
Almost every day Carl was off with the teams
When he did come home in working hours he would take his dinner with the men and boys in the outer kitchen
Jennie sometimes waited on them but he rarely spoke to her as she passed in and out except with his eyes
When Cully handed him the scarf Carl had already dressed himself in his best clothes producing so marked a change in the outward appearance of the young Swede that Cully in his admiration pronounced him out o sight
Cullys metamorphosis was even more complete than Carls
Now that the warm spring days were approaching Mr Finnegan had decided that his superabundant locks were unseasonable and had therefore had his hair cropped close to his scalp showing here and there a white scar the record of some former scrimmage
Reaching to the edge of each ear was a collar as stiff as pasteboard
His derby was tilted over his left eyebrow shading a face brimming over with fun and expectancy
Below this was a vermilioncolored necktie and a black coat and trousers
His shoes sported three coats of blacking which only partly concealed the dustmarks of his profession
Hully gee Carl
but de circuss agoin ter be a dandy he called out in delight as he patted a double shuffle with his feet
I see de picters on de fence when I come from de ferry
Deres a chariotrace out o sight an a elephant what stands on is head
Hold on till I see ef de Big Gray s got enough beddin under him
He wuz awful stiff dis mornin when I helped him up
Cully never went to bed without seeing the Gray first made comfortable for the night
The two young fellows saw all the sights and after filling their pockets with peanuts and themselves with pink lemonade took their seats at last under the canvas roof where they waited impatiently for the performance to begin
The only departure from the ordinary routine was Cullys instant acceptance of the clowns challenge to ride the trick mule and his winning the wager amid the plaudits of the audience after a roughandtumble scramble in the sawdust sticking so tight to his back that a bystander remarked that the only way to get the boy off would be to peel the mule
When they returned it was nearly midnight
Cully had taken off his choker as he called it and had curled it outside his hat They had walked over from the show and the tight clutch of the collar greatly interfered with Cullys discussion of the wonderful things he had seen
Besides the mule had ruined it completely for a second use
It was a warm night for early spring and Carl had his coat over his arm
When they reached the outer stable fencethe one nearest the villageCullys keen nose scented a peculiar odor
Whos been a breakin de lamp round here Carl
he asked sniffing close to the ground
Holy smoke
Look at de light in de stablesumpin mus be de matter wid de Big Gray or de ole woman wouldnt be out dis time o night wid a lamp
What would she be adoin out here anyway
he exclaimed in a sudden anxious tone
Dis aint de road from de house
Hully gee
Look out for yer coat
De rails is asoakin wid kersene
At this moment a little flame shot out of the window over the Big Grays head and licked its way up the siding followed by a column of smoke which burst through the door in the hayloft above the stalls of the three horses next the bedroom of Carl and Cully
A window was hastily opened in Toms house and a frightened shriek broke the stillness of the night
It was Jennies voice and it had a tone of something besides alarm
What the sight of the fire had paralyzed in Carl the voice awoke
No no
I hereI safe Jan
he cried clearing the fence with a bound
Cully did not hear Jennie
He saw only the curling flames over the Big Grays head
As he dashed down the slope he kept muttering the old horses pet names catching his breath and calling to Carl Save de Graysave Ole Blowhard
Cully reached the stable first smashed the padlock with a shovel and rushed into the Grays stall
Carl seized a horsebucket and began sousing the windowsills of the harnessroom where the fire was hottest
By this time the whole house was aroused
Tom dazed by the sudden awakening with her ulster thrown about her shoulders stood barefooted on the porch
Jennie was still at the window sobbing as if her heart would break now that Carl was safe
Patsy had crawled out of his low crib by his mothers bed and was stumbling downstairs one foot at a time
Twice had Cully tried to drag the old horse clear of his stall and twice had he fallen back for fresh air
Then came a smothered cry from inside the blinding smoke a burst of flame lighting up the stable and the Big Gray was pushed out his head wrapped in Carls coat the Swede pressing behind Cully coaxing him on his arms around the horses neck
Hardly had the Big Gray cleared the stable when the roof of the small extension fell and a great burst of flame shot up into the night air
All hope of rescuing the other two horses was now gone
Tom did not stand long dazed and bewildered
In a twinkling she had drawn on a pair of mens boots over her bare feet buckled her ulster over her nightdress and rushed back upstairs to drag the blankets from the beds
Laden with these she sprang down the steps called to Jennie to follow soaked the bedding in the watertrough and picking up the dripping mass carried it to Carl and Cully who now that the Gray was safely tied to the kitchen porch were on the roof of the toolhouse fighting the sparks that fell on the shingles
By this time the neighbors began to arrive from the tenements
Tom took charge of every man as soon as he got his breath stationed two at the pumphandle and formed a line of bucketpassers from the watertrough to Carl and Cully who were spreading the blankets on the roof
The heat now was terrific Carl had to shield his face with his sleeve as he threw the water
Cully lay flat on the shingles holding to the steaming blankets and directing Carls buckets with his outstretched finger when some greater spark lodged and gained headway
If they could keep these burning brands under until the heat had spent itself they could perhaps save the toolhouse and the larger stable
All this time Patsy had stood on the porch where Tom had left him hanging over the railing wrapped in Jennies shawl
He was not to move until she came for him she wanted him out of the way of trampling feet
Now and then she would turn anxiously catch sight of his wizened face dazed with fright wave her hand to him encouragingly and work on
Suddenly the little fellow gave a cry of terror and slid from the porch trailing the shawl after him his crutch jerking over the ground his sobs almost choking him
Mammy
Cully
Stumpys tied in the loft
Oh somebody help me
Hes in the loft
Oh please please
In the roar of the flames nobody heard him
The noise of axes beating down the burning fences drowned all other sounds
At this moment Tom was standing on a cart passing up the buckets to Carl
Cully had crawled to the ridgepole of the toolhouse to watch both sides of the threatened roof
The little cripple made his way slowly into the crowd nearest the sheltered side of the toolhouse pulling at the mens coats pleading with them to save his goat his Stumpy
On this side was a door opening into a room where the chains were kept
From it rose a short flight of six or seven steps leading to the loft
This loft had two big doorsone closed nearest the fire and the other wide open fronting the house
When the roof of the burning stable fell the wisps of straw in the cracks of the closed door burst into flame
Within three feet of this blazing mass shivering with fear tugging at his rope his eyes bursting from his head stood Stumpy his piteous bleatings unheard in the surrounding roar
A childs head appeared above the floor followed by a cry of joy as the boy flung himself upon the straining rope
The next instant a halffrenzied goat sprang through the open door and landed in the yard below in the midst of the startled men and women
Tom was on the cart when she saw this streak of light flash out of the darkness of the loft door and disappear
Her eyes instinctively turned to look at Patsy in his place on the porch
Then a cry of horror burst from the crowd silenced instantly as a piercing shriek filled the air
My God
Its me Patsy
Bareheaded in the open doorway of the now blazing loft a silhouette against the flame his little white gown reaching to his knees his crutch gone the stifling smoke rolling out in great whirls above his head stood the cripple
Tom hurled herself into the crowd knocking the men out of her way and ran towards the chain room door
At this instant a man in his shirtsleeves dropped from the smoking roof sprang in front of her and caught her in his arms
No not you go Carl go
he said in a firm voice holding her fast
Before she could speak he snatched a handkerchief from a womans neck plunged it into the water of the horsetrough bound it about his head dashed up the short flight of steps and crawled toward the terrorstricken child
There was a quick clutch a bound back and the smoke rolled over them shutting man and child from view
The crowd held their breath as it waited
A man with his hair singed and his shirt on fire staggered from the side door
In his arms he carried the almost lifeless boy his face covered by the handkerchief
A woman rushed up caught the boy in her arms and sank on her knees
The man reeled and fell







When Carl regained consciousness Jennie was bending over him chafing his hands and bathing his face
Patsy was on the sofa wrapped in Jennies shawl
Pop was fanning him
Carls wet handkerchief the old man said had kept the boy from suffocating
The crowd had begun to disperse
The neighbors and strangers had gone their several ways
The tenementhouse mob were on the road to their beds
Many friends had stopped to sympathize and even the bitterest of Toms enemies said they were glad it was no worse
When the last of them had left the yard Tom tired out with anxiety and hard work threw herself down on the porch
The morning was already breaking the gray streaks of dawn brightening the east
From her seat she could hear through the open door the soothing tones of Jennies voice as she talked to her lover and the hoarse whispers of Carl in reply
He had recovered his breath again and was but little worse for his scorching except in his speech
Jennie was in the kitchen making some coffee for the exhausted workers and he was helping her
Tom realized fully all that had happened
She knew who had saved Patsys life
She remembered how he laid her boy in her arms and she still saw the deathly pallor in his face as he staggered and fell
What had he not done for her and her household since he entered her service
If he loved Jennie and she him was it his fault
Why did she rebel and refuse this man a place in her home
Then she thought of her own Tom no longer with her and of her fight alone and without him
What would he have thought of it
How would he have advised her to act
He had always hoped such great things for Jennie
Would he now be willing to give her to this stranger
If she could only talk to her Tom about it all
As she sat her head in her hand the smoking stable the eager wildeyed crowd the dead horses faded away and became to her as a dream
She heard nothing but the voice of Jennie and her lover saw only the white face of her boy
A sickening sense of utter loneliness swept over her
She rose and moved away
During all this time Cully was watching the dying embers and when all danger was overonly the small stable with its two horses had been destroyedhe led the Big Gray back to the pump washed his head sponging his eyes and mouth and housed him in the big stable
Then he vanished
Immediately on leaving the Big Gray Cully had dodged behind the stable run rapidly up the hill keeping close to the fence and had come out behind a group of scattering spectators
There he began a series of complicated manoeuvres mostly on his toes lifting his head over those of the crowd and ending in a sudden dart forward and as sudden a halt within a few inches of young Billy McGaws coatcollar
Billy turned pale but held his ground
He felt sure Cully would not dare attack him with so many others about
Then again the glow of the smouldering cinders had a fascination for him that held him to the spot
Cully also seemed spellbound
The only view of the smoking ruins that satisfied him seemed to be the one he caught over young McGaws shoulder
He moved closer and closer sniffing about cautiously as a dog would on a trail
Indeed the closer he got to Billys coat the more absorbed he seemed to be in the view beyond
Here an extraordinary thing happened
There was a dipping of Cullys head between Billys legs a raising of both arms grabbing Billy around the waist and in a flash the hope of the house of McGaw was swept off his feet Cully beneath him and in full run toward Toms house
The bystanders laughed they thought it only a boyish trick
Billy kicked and struggled but Cully held on
When they were clear of the crowd Cully shook him to the ground and grabbed him by the coatcollar
Say young feller where wuz ye when de fire started
At this Billy broke into a howl and one of the crowd some distance off looked up
Cully clapped his hand over his mouth
None o that or Ill mash yer mugsee
standing over him with clenched fist
I warnt nowheres stammered Billy
Say take yer hands offn meye aint Tell I aint
Ye answer me straightseeor Ill punch yer face in tightening his grasp
What wuz ye adoin when de circus come outan anoder ting whats dis cologne yer got on yer coat
Maybe next time ye climb a fence yell keep from spillin it see
Oh Im onter ye
Ye set de stable afire
Dats whats de matter
I hope I may dieI wuz acarryin de can er kersene home an when de roof fell in I wuz up on de fence so I cud see de fire an de can slipped What fence
said Cully shaking him as a terrier would a rat
Why dat fence on de hill
That was enough for Cully
He had his man
The lie had betrayed him
Without a word he jerked the cowardly boy from the ground and marched him straight into the kitchen Say Carl I got de firebug
Ye kin smell der kersene on his cloes
XIII MR QUIGG DRAWS A PLAN McGaw had watched the fire from his upper window with mingled joy and fearjoy that Toms property was on fire and fear that it would be put out before she would be ruined
He had been waiting all the evening for Crimmins who had failed to arrive
Billy had not been at home since supper so he could get no details as to the amount of the damage from that source
In this emergency he sent next morning for Quigg to make a reconnaissance in the vicinity of the enemys camp ascertain how badly Tom had been crippled and learn whether her loss would prevent her signing the contract the following night
Mr Quigg accepted the mission the more willingly because he wanted to settle certain affairs of his own
Jennie had avoided him latelywhy he could not telland he determined before communicating to his employer the results of his inquiries about Tom to know exactly what his own chances were with the girl
He could slip over to the house while Tom was in the city and leave before she returned
On his way the next day he robbed a garden fence of a mass of lilacs breaking off the leaves as he walked
When he reached the door of the big stable he stopped for a moment glanced cautiously in to see if he could find any preparations for the new work and then making a mental note of the surroundings followed the path to the porch
Pop opened the door
He knew Quigg only by sightan unpleasant sight he thought as he looked into his hesitating wavering eyes
Its a bad fire ye had Mr Mullins said Quigg seating himself in the rocker the blossoms half strangled in his grasp
Yis purty bad but small loss thank God said Pop quietly
That lets her out of the contract dont it
said Quigg
Shell be short of horses now
Pop made no answer
He did not intend to give Mr Quigg any information that might comfort him
Were ye insured
asked Quigg in a cautious tone his eyes on the lilacs
Oh yis ivery pinny on what was burned so Mary tells me
Quigg caught his breath the rumor in the village was the other way
Why didnt Crimmins make a clean sweep of it and burn em all at once he said to himself
I brought some flowers over for Miss Jennie said Quigg regaining his composure
Is she in
Yis Ill call her
Gentle and apparently harmless as Granpop was men like Quigg somehow never looked him steadily in the eye
I was tellin Mr Mullins I brought ye over some flowers said Quigg turning to Jennie as she entered and handing her the bunch without leaving his seat as if it had been a pair of shoes
Youre very kind Mr Quigg said the girl laying them on the table and still standing
I heard your brother Patsy was near smothered till Dutchy got him out
Was ye there
Jennie bit her lip and her heart quickened
Carls sobriquet in the village coming from such lips sent the hot blood to her cheeks
Yes Mr Nilsson saved his life she answered slowly with girlish dignity a backward rush filling her heart as she remembered Carl staggering out of the burning stable Patsy held close to his breast
The fellers in Rockville say ye think it was set afire
I see Justice Rowan turned Billy McGaw loose
Do ye suspect anybody else
Some says a tramp crawled in and upset his pipe
This lie was coined on the spot and issued immediately to see if it would pass
Mother says she knows who did it and itll all come out in time
Cully found the can this morning said Jennie leaning against the table
Quiggs jaw fell and his brow knit as Jennie spoke
That was just like the fool he said to himself
Why didnt he get the stuff in a bottle and then break it
But the subject was too dangerous to linger over so he began talking of the dance down at the Town Hall and the meeting last Sunday after church
He asked her if she would go with him to the sociable they were going to have at No
4 Truckhouse and when she said she couldntthat her mother didnt want her to go out etcQuigg moved his chair closer with the remark that the old woman was always putting her oar in and spoiling things the way she was going on with the Union would ruin her shed better join in with the boys and be friendly theyd down her yet if she didnt
I hope nothing will happen to mother Mr Quigg said Jennie in an anxious tone as she sank into a chair
Quigg misunderstood the movement and moved his own closer
There wont nothin happen any more Jennie if youll do as I say
It was the first time he had ever called her by her name
She could not understand how he dared
She wished Carl would come in
Will you do it
asked Quigg eagerly his cunning face and mean eyes turned toward her
Jennie never raised her head
Her cheeks were burning
Quigg went on Ive been keepin company with ye Jennie all winter and the fellers is guyin me about it
You know Im solid with the Union and can help yer mother and if yell let me speak to Father McCluskey next Sunday The girl sprang from her chair
I wont have you talk that way to me Dennis Quigg
I never said a word to you and you know it
Her mothers spirit was now flashing in her eyes
You ought to be ashamed of yourself to come hereand Then she broke down
Another woman would have managed it differently perhapsby a laugh a smile of contempt or a frigid refusal
This mere child stung to the quick by Quiggs insult had only her tears in defense
The Walking Delegate turned his head and looked out of the window
Then he caught up his hat and without a word to the sobbing girl hastily left the room
Tom was just entering the lower gate
Quigg saw her and tried to dodge behind the toolhouse but it was too late so he faced her
Toms keen eye caught the sly movement and the quickly altered expression
Some new trickery was in the air she knew she detected it in every line of Quiggs face
What was McGaw up to now
she asked herself
Was he after Carl and the men or getting ready to burn the other stable
Goodmorning Mr Quigg
Aint ye lost
she asked coldly
Oh no said Quigg with a forced laugh
I come over to see if I could help about the fire
It was the first thing that came into his head he had hoped to pass with only a nod of greeting
Did ye
replied Tom thoughtfully
She saw he had lied but she led him on
What kind of help did ye think of givin
The insurance company will pay the money the two horses is buried an we begin diggin postholes for a new stable in the mornin
Perhaps ye were thinkin of lendin a hand yerself
If ye did I can put ye alongside of Carl one shovel might do for both of ye
Quigg colored and laughed uneasily
Somebody had told her then how Carl had threatened him with uplifted shovel when he tried to coax the Swede away
No Im not diggin these days but Ive got a pull wid the insurance adjuster and might git an extra allowance for yer
This was cut from whole cloth
He had never known an adjuster in his life
Whats that
asked Tom still looking square at him Quigg squirming under her glance like a worm on a pin
Well the company cant tell how much feed was in the bins and tools and sech like he said with another laugh
A laugh is always a safe parry when a pair of clear gray searchlight eyes are cutting into one like a rapier
An yer idea is for me to git paid for stuff that wasnt burned up is it
Well thats as how the adjuster says
Sometimes he sees it an sometimes he dontthats where the pull comes in
Tom put her arms akimbo her favorite attitude when her anger began to rise
Oh I see
The pull is in bribin the adjuster as ye call him so he can cheat the company
Quigg shrugged his shoulders that part of the transaction was a mere trifle
What were companies made for but to be cheated
Tom stood for a minute looking him all over
Dennis Quigg she said slowly weighing each word her eyes riveted on his face yere a very sharp young man yere so very sharp that I wonder yeve gone so long without cuttin yerself But one thing I tell ye an that is if ye keep on the way yere agoin yell land where you belong and thats up the river in a potatobug suit of clothes
Turn yer head this way Quigg
Did ye niver in yer whole life think there was somethin worth the havin in bein honest an clean an square an holdin yer head up like a man instead of skulkin round like a thief
What yere up to this mornin I dont know yet but I want to tell ye it s the wrong time o day for ye to make calls and the nights not much better unless yere particularly invited
Quigg smothered a curse and turned on his heel toward the village
When he reached OLearys Dempsey of the Executive Committee met him at the door
He and McGaw had spent the whole morning in devising plans to keep Tom out of the boardroom
Quiggs report was not reassuring
She would be paid her insurance money he said and would certainly be at the meeting that night
The three adjourned to the room over the bar
McGaw began pacing the floor his long arms hooked behind his back
He had passed a sleepless night and every hour now added to his anxiety
His face was a dull gray yellow and his eyes were sunken
Now and then he would tug at his collar nervously
As he walked he clutched his fingers burying the nails in the palms the red hair on his wrists bristling like spiders legs
Dempsey sat at the table watching him calmly out of the corner of his eye
After a pause Quigg leaned over his lips close to Dempseys ear
Then he drew a plan on the back of an old winelist
It marked the position of the door in Toms stable and that of a path which ran across lots and was concealed from her house by a low fence
Dempsey studied it a moment nodding at Quiggs whispered explanations and passed it to McGaw repeating Quiggs words
McGaw stopped and bent his head
A dull gleam flashed out of his smouldering eyes
The lines of his face hardened and his jaw tightened
For some minutes he stood irresolute gazing vacantly over the budding trees through the window
Then he turned sharply swallowed a brimming glass of raw whiskey and left the room
When the sound of his footsteps had died away Dempsey looked at Quigg meaningly and gave a low laugh
XIV BLOSSOMWEEK It was blossomweek and every garden and hedge flaunted its bloom in the soft air
All about was the perfume of flowers the odor of fresh grass and that peculiar earthy smell of newmade garden beds but lately sprinkled
Behind the hill overlooking the harbor the sun was just sinking into the sea
Some sentinel cedars guarding its crest stood out in clear relief against the golden light
About their tops in wide circles swooped a flock of crows
Granpop and Tom sat on the front porch their chairs touching his hand on hers
She had been telling him of Quiggs visit that morning
She had changed her dress for a new one
The dress was of brown cloth and had been made in the villagetight where it should be loose and loose where it should be tight
She had put it on she told Pop to make a creditable appearance before the board that night
Jennie was flitting in and out between the sittingroom and the garden her hands full of blossoms filling the china jars on the mantel none of them contained Quiggs contribution
Patsy was flat on his back on the small patch of green surrounding the porch playing circuselephant with Stumpy who stood over him with leveled head
Up the hill but a few rods away Cully was grazing the Big Graythe old horse munching tufts of fresh sweet grass sprinkled with dandelions
Cully walked beside him
Now and then he lifted one of his legs examining the hoof critically for possible tender places
There was nothing the matter with the Gray the old horse was still sound but it satisfied Cully to be assured and it satisfied too a certain yearning tenderness in his heart toward his old chum
Once in a while he would pat the Grays neck smoothing his ragged half worn mane addressing him all the while in words of endearment expressed in a slang positively profane and utterly without meaning except to these two
Suddenly Jennies cheek flushed as she came out on the porch
Carl was coming up the path
The young Swede was bareheaded the short blond curls glistening in the light his throat was bare too so that one could see the big muscles in his neck
Jennie always liked him with his throat bare it reminded her of a hero she had once seen in a play who stormed a fort and rescued all the starving women
Da brown horse seek batta come to stabble an see him Carl said going direct to the porch where he stood in front of Tom resting one hand on his hip his eyes never wandering from her face
He knew where Jennie was but he never looked
Whats the matter with him
asked Tom her thoughts far away at the moment
I don know he no eat da oats en da box
Will he drink
said Tom awakening to the importance of the information
Yas mos two buckets
Its fever hes got she said turning to Pop
I thought that yisterday noon when I sees him aworkin
All right Carl Ill be down before I go to the board meetin
And see here Carl yed better git ready to go wid me
Ill start in a couple o hours
Will it suit ye Granpop if Carl goes with me
patting her fathers shoulder
If ye keep on aworritin Ill hev to hire a cop to follow me round
Carl lingered for a moment on the steps
Perhaps Tom had some further orders perhaps too Jennie would come out again
Involuntarily his eye wandered toward the open door and then he turned to go
Jennies heart sprang up in her throat
She had seen from behind the curtains the shade of disappointment that crossed her lovers face
She could suffer herself but she could not see Carl unhappy
In an instant she was beside her mother
Anything to keep Carlshe did not care what
Oh Carl will you bring the ladder so I can reach the long branches
she said her quick wit helping her with a subterfuge
Carl turned and glanced at Tom
He felt the look in her face and could read her thoughts
If Tom had heard Jennie she never moved
This affair must end in some way she said to herself
Why had she not sent him away long before
How could she do it now when he had risked his life to save Patsy
Then she answered firmly still without turning her head No Jennie there wont be time
Carl must get ready to Pop laid his hand on hers
Theres plinty o toime Mary
Yell git the ladder behint the kitchen door Carl
I hed it ther mesilf this mornin
Carl found the ladder steadied it against the tree and guided Jennies little feet till they reached the topmost round holding on to her skirts so that she should not fall
Above their heads the branches twined and interlaced shedding their sweetest blossoms over their happy upturned faces
The old mans eyes lightened as he watched them for some moments then turning to Tom his voice full of tenderness he said Carls a foine lad Mary yell do no better for Jinnie
Tom did not answer her eyes were on the cedars where the crows were flying black silhouettes against the yellow sky
Did I shtop ye an break yer heart whin ye wint off wid yer own Tom
What wuz he but an honest lad thet loved ye an he wid not a pinny in his pocket but the fare that brought ye both to the new counthry
Toms eyes filled
She could not see the cedars now
All the hill was swimming in light
Oi hev watched Carl sence he fust come Mary
Its a good mither someers as has lost a foine by
Wudnt ye be lonely yersilf ef yed come here wid nobody to touch yer hand 
Tom shivered and covered her face
Who was more lonely than sheshe who had hungered for the same companionship that she was denying Jennie she who had longed for somebody to stand between her and the world some hand to touch some arm to lean on she who must play the man alwaysthe man and the mother too
Pop went on stroking her strong firm hand with his stiff shriveled fingers
He never looked at her his face was now too turned toward the dying sun
Do ye remimber the day ye left me in the ould counthry Mary wid yer own Tom an how I walked wid ye to the turnin of the road
It wuz spring thin an the hedges all white wid blossoms
Look at thim two over there Mary wid their arms full o flowers
Dont be breakin their hearts child
Tom turned and slipped her arm around the old mans neck her head sinking on his shoulder
The tears were under her eyelids her heart was bursting only her pride sustained her
Then in a halfwhispered voice like a child telling its troubles she said Ye dont knowye dont know Granpop
The dear God knows its not on account of meself
Its Tom Im thinkin of night an dayme Tom me Tom
Shes his child as well as mine
If he could only help me
He wanted such great things for Jennie
It ud be easier if he hadnt saved Patsy
Dont speak to me agin about it father dear it hurts me
The old man rose from his chair and walked slowly into the house
All his talks with his daughter ended in this way
It was always what Tom would have thought
Why should a poor crazy cripple like her husband shut up in an asylum make trouble for Jennie
When the light faded and the trees grew indistinct in the gloom Tom still sat where Pop had left her
Soon the shadows fell in the little valley and the hill beyond the cedars lost itself in the deepening haze that now crept in from the tranquil sea
Carls voice calling to Cully to take in the Gray roused her to consciousness
She pushed back her chair stood for an instant watching Carl romping with Patsy and then walked slowly toward the stable
By the time she reached the watertrough her old manner had returned
Her step became once more elastic and firm her strong will asserted itself
She had work to do and at once
In two hours the board would meet
She needed all her energies and resources
The lovers must wait she could not decide any question for them now
As she passed the stable window a man in a fur cap raised his head cautiously above the low fence and shrank back into the shadow
Tom threw open the door and felt along the sill for the lantern and matches
They were not in their accustomed place
The man crouched ran noiselessly toward the rear entrance and crept in behind a stall
Tom laid her hand on the haunches of the horse and began rolling back his blanket
The man drew himself up slowly until his shoulders were on a level with the planking
Tom moved a step and turned her face
The man raised his arm whirled a hammer high in the air and brought it down upon her head
When Cully led the Big Gray into his stall a moment later he stepped into a pool of blood
XV IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH At the appointed hour the Board of Trustees met in the hall over the postoffice
The usual loungers filled the roommembers of the Union and others who had counted on a piece of the highway pie when it was cut
Dempsey Crimmins and Quigg sat outside the rail against the wall
They were waiting for McGaw who had not been seen since the afternoon
The president was in his accustomed place
The five gentlemen of leisure the veterinary surgeon and the other trustees occupied their several chairs
The roll had been called and every man had answered to his name
The occasion being one of much importance a full board was required
As the minutehand neared the hour of nine Dempsey became uneasy
He started every time a newcomer mounted the stairs
Where was McGaw
No one had seen him since he swallowed the tumblerful of whiskey and disappeared from OLearys a few hours before
The president rapped for order and announced that the board was ready to sign the contract with Thomas Grogan for the hauling and delivery of the broken stone required for public highways
There was no response
Is Mrs Grogan here
asked the president looking over the room and waiting for a reply
Is any one here who represents her
he repeated after a pause rising in his seat as he spoke
No one answered
The only sound heard in the room was that of the heavy step of a man mounting the stairs
Is there any one here who can speak for Mrs Thomas Grogan
called the president again in a louder voice
I can said the man with the heavy tread who proved to be the foreman at the brewery
She wont live till mornin one of her horses kicked her and broke her skull so McGaw told me
Broke her skull
My God
man how do you know
demanded the president his voice trembling with excitement
Every mans face was now turned toward the newcomer a momentary thrill of horror ran through the assemblage
I heard it at the druggists
One of her boys was over for medicine
Dr Mason sewed up her head
He was drivin by on his way to Quarantine when it happened
What Dr
Mason
asked a trustee eager for details
The man what used to be at Quarantine seven years ago
Hes appinted agin
Dempsey caught up his hat and hurriedly left the room followed by Quigg and Crimmins
McGaw he said to himself as he ran downstairs must be blind drunk not to come to the meeting 
him
What if he gives everything away
he added aloud
This news is awful said the president
I am very sorry for Mrs Grogan and her childrenshe was a fine woman
It is a serious matter too for the village
The highway work ought to commence at once the roads need it
We may now have to advertise again
That would delay everything for a month
Well theres other bids said another trusteeone of the gentlemen of leisureignoring the presidents sympathy and hopeful now of a possible slice on his own account
Whats the matter with McGaws proposal
Theres not much difference in the price
Perhaps he would come down to the Grogan figure
Is Mr McGaw here or anybody who can speak for him
Justice Rowan sat against the wall
The overzealous trustee had exactly expressed his own wishes and anxieties
He wanted McGaws chances settled at once
If they failed there was Rowans own brother who might come in for the work the justice sharing of course in the profits
In the absence of me client said Rowan looking about the room and drawing in his breath with an important air I suppose I can ripresint him
I think however that if your honorable boord will go on with the other business before you Mr McGaw will be on hand in half an hour himself
In the meantime I will hunt him up
I move said the Scotch surgeon in a voice that showed how deeply he had been affected that the whole matter be laid on the table for a week until we know for certain whether poor Mrs Grogan is killed or not
I can hardly credit it
It is very seldom that a horse kicks a woman
Nobody having seconded this motion the chair did not put it
The fact was that every man was afraid to move
The majority of the trustees who favored McGaw were in the dark as to what effect Toms death would have upon the bids
The law might require readvertising and hence a new competition and perhaps somebody much worse for them than Tom might turn up and take the worksomebody living outside of the village
Then none of them would get a finger in the pie
Worse than all the cutting of it might have to be referred to the corporation counsel Judge Bowker
What his opinion would be was past finding out
He was beyond the reach of pulls and followed the law to the letter
The minoritya minority of two the president and the veterinary surgeonbegan to distrust the spirit of McGaws adherents
It looked to the president as if a deal were in the air
The Scotchman practical soberminded sensible man as he was had old fashioned ideas of honesty and fair play
He had liked Tom from the first time he saw herhe had looked after her stables professionallyand he did not intend to see her dead or alive thrown out without making a fight for her
I move said he that the president appoint a committee of this board to jump into the nearest wagon drive to Mrs Grogans and find out whether she is still alive
If shes dead that settles it but if shes alive I will protest against anything being done about this matter for ten days
It wont take twenty minutes to find out meantime we can take up the unfinished business of the last meeting
One of the gentlemen of leisure seconded this motion it was carried unanimously and this gentleman of leisure was himself appointed courier and left the room in a hurry
He had hardly reached the street when he was back again followed closely by Dempsey Quigg Crimmins Justice Rowan and last of all fumbling with his fur cap deathly pale and entirely soberDan McGaw
Theres no use of my going said the courier trustee taking his seat
Grogan wont live an hour if she aint dead now
She had a sick horse that wanted looking after and she went into the stable without a light and he let drive and broke her skull
Shes got a gash the length of your handwasnt that it Mr
McGaw
McGaw nodded his head
Yes thats about it he said
The voice seemed to come from his stomach it was so hollow
Did you see her Mr
McGaw
asked the Scotchman in a positive tone
How cud I be aseein her whin I been in New Yorruk mos all day
D ye think Im runnin roun to ivery stable in the place
I wuz acomin cross lots whin I heared it
They says the horse had blin staggers
How do you know then
asked the Scotchman suspiciously
Who told you the horse kicked her
Well I dunno I think it wuz some un Dempsey looked at him and knit his brow
McGaw stopped
Dont you know enough of a horse to know he couldnt kick with blind staggers
insisted the Scotchman
McGaw did not answer
Does anybody know any of the facts connected with this dreadful accident to Mrs
Grogan
asked the president
Have you heard anything Mr
Quigg
Mr Quigg had heard absolutely nothing and had not seen Mrs Grogan for months
Mr Crimmins was equally ignorant and so were several other gentlemen
Here a voice came from the back of the room
I met Dr Mason sir an hour ago after he had attended Tom Grogan
He was on his way to Quarantine in his buggy
He said he left her insensible after dressin the wound
He thought she might not live till mornin
May I ask your name sir
asked the president in a courteous tone
Peter Lathers
I am yardmaster at the U S Lighthouse Depot
The title and the calm way in which Lathers spoke convinced the president and the room
Everybody realized that Toms life hung by a thread
The Scotchman still had a lingering doubt
He also wished to clear up the blindstaggers theory
Did he say how she was hurt
asked the Scotchman
Yes
He said he was adrivin by when they picked her up and he was dead sure that somebody had hid in the stable and knocked her on the head with a club
McGaw steadied himself with his hand and grasped the seat of his chair
The sweat was rolling from his face
He seemed afraid to look up lest some other eye might catch his own and read his thoughts
If he had only seen Lathers come in
Latherss announcement coupled with the Scotchmans wellknown knowledge of equine diseases discrediting the blindstaggers theory produced a profound sensation
Heads were put together and low whispers were heard
Dempsey Quigg and Crimmins did not move a muscle
The Scotchman again broke the silence
There seems to be no question gentlemen that the poor woman is badly hurt but she is still alive and while she breathes we have no right to take this work from her
Its not decent to serve a woman so and I think too its illegal
I again move that the whole matter be laid upon the table This motion was not put nobody seconding it
Then Justice Rowan rose
The speech of the justice was seasoned with a brogue as delicate in flavor as the garlic in a Spanish salad
Mr Prisident and Gintlemen of the Honorable Boord of Village Trustees said the justice throwing back his coat
The elaborate opening compelled attention at once
Such courtesies were too seldom heard in their deliberations thought the members as they lay back in their chairs to listen
No wan can be moore pained than meself that so estimable a woman as Mrs Grogana woman who fills so honorably her every station in lifeshould at this moment be stricken down either by the hand of an assassin or the hoof of a horse
Such acts in a lawabidin community like Rockville bring with them the deepest detistation and the profoundest sympathy
No wan I am sure is more touched by her misforchune than me worthy friend Mr Daniel McGaw who by this direct interposition of Providence is foorced into the position of being compelled to assert his rights befoore your honorable body with full assurance that there is no tribunal in the land to which he could apply which would lend a more willing ear
It was this sort of thing that made Rowan popular
But gintlemenhere the justice currycombed his front hair with his fingersgreasy jetblack hair worn long as befitted his positionthis is not a question of sympathy but a question of law
Your honorable boord advertoised some time since for certain supplies needed for the growth and development of this most important of the villages of Staten Island
In this call it was most positively and clearly stated that the contract was to be awarded to the lowest risponsible bidder who gave the proper bonds
Two risponses were made to this call wan by Mrs Grogan acting on behalf of her husbandwell known to be a hopeless cripple in wan of the many charitable institootions of our noble Stateand the other by our distinguished fellowtownsman Mr Daniel McGaw whom I have the honor to ripresint
With that strict sinse of justice which has always characterized the decisions of this honorable boord the contract was promptly awarded to Thomas Grogan he being the lowest bidder and my client Daniel McGawhonest Daniel McGaw I should call him if his presence did not deter mestood wan side in obadience to the will of the people and the laws of the State and accepted his defate with that calmness which always distinguishes the hardworkin sons of toil who are not only the bone and sinoo of our land but its honor and proide
But gintlemenrunning his hand lightly through his hair and then laying it in the bulging lapels of his now halfbuttoned coatthere were other conditions accompanying these proposals to wit that within tin days from said openin the successful bidder should appear befoore this honorable body and then and there duly affix his signatoor to the aforesaid contracts already prepared by the attorney of this boord my honored associate Judge Bowker
Now gintlemen I ask you to look at the clock whose calm face like a rising moon presides over the deliberations of this boord and note the passin hour and then I ask you to cast your eyes over this vast assemblage and see if Thomas Grogan or any wan ripresinting him or her or who in any way is connected with him or her is within the confines of this noble hall to execute the mandates of this distinguished boord
Can it be believed for an instant that if Mrs Grogan acting for her partly dismimbered husband Mr Thomas Grogan had intinded to sign this contract she would not have dispatched on the wings of the wind some Mercury fleet of foot to infarm this boord of her desire for postponement
I demand in the interests of justice that the contract be awarded to the lowest risponsible bidder who is ready to sign the contract with proper bonds whether that bidder is Grogan McGaw Jones Robinson or Smith
There was a burst of applause and great stamping of feet the tide of sympathy had changed
Rowan had perhaps won a few more votes
This pleased him evidently more than his hope of cutting the contract pie
McGaw began to regain some of his color and lose some of his nervousness
Rowans speech had quieted him
The president gravely rapped for order
It was wonderful how much backbone and dignity and selfrespect the justices very flattering remarks had injected into the nine trusteesno eight for the Scotchman fully understood and despised Rowans oratorical powers
The Scotchman was on his feet in an instant
I have listened he said to the talk that Justice Rowan has given us
Its very fine and tonguey but it smothers up the facts
You cant rob this woman Question
question
came from half a dozen throats
Whats your pleasure gentlemen
asked the president pounding with his gavel
I move said the courier member that the contract be awarded to Mr Daniel McGaw as the lowest bidder provided he can sign the contract tonight with proper bonds
Four members seconded it
Is Mr McGaws bondsman present
asked the president rising
Justice Rowan rose and bowed with the air of a foreign banker accepting a government loan
I have that honor Mr Prisident
I am willing to back Mr McGaw to the extent of me humble possissions which are ample I trust for the purposes of this contractlooking around with an air of entire confidence
Gentlemen are you ready for the question
asked the president
At this instant there was a slight commotion at the end of the hall
Half a dozen men nearest the door left their seats and crowded to the top of the staircase
Then came a voice outside Fall back dont block up the door
Get back there
The excitement was so great that the proceedings of the board were stopped
The throng parted The men near the table stood still
An ominous silence suddenly prevailed
Daniel McGaw twisted his head turned ghastly white and would have fallen from his chair but for Dempsey
Advancing through the door with slow measured tread her long cloak reaching to her feet erect calm fearless her face like chalk her lips compressed stifling the agony of every step her eyes deep sunken blackrimmed burning like coals her brow bound with a bloodstained handkerchief that barely hid the bandages beneath came Tom
The deathly hush was unbroken
The men fell back with white scared faces to let her pass
McGaw cowered in his chair
Dempseys eyes glistened a halfsigh of relief escaping him
Crimmins had not moved the apparition stunned him
On she came her eyes fixed on the president till she reached the table
Then she steadied herself for a moment took a roll of papers from her dress and sank into a chair
No one spoke
The crowd pressed closer
Those outside the rail noiselessly mounted the benches and chairs craning their necks
Every eye was fixed upon her
Slowly and carefully she unrolled the contract spreading it out before her picked up a pen from the table and without a word wrote her name
Then she rose firmly and walked steadily to the door
Just then a man entered within the rail and took her seat
It was her bondsman Mr Crane
XVI A FRIEND IN NEED Two days after Tom had signed the highway contract Babcock sat in his private office in New York opening his mail
In the outside room were half a dozen employeesengineers and othersawaiting their instructions
The fine spring weather had come and work had been started in every direction including the second section of the seawall at the depot where the divers were preparing the bottom for the layers of concrete
Toms carts had hauled the stone
Tucked into the pile of letters heaped before him Babcocks quick eye caught the corner of a telegram
It read as follows Mother hurt
Wants you immediately
Please come
JENNIE GROGAN
For an instant he sat motionless gazing at the yellow slip
Then he sprang to his feet
Thrusting his unopened correspondence into his pocket he gave a few hurried instructions to his men and started for the ferry
Once on the boat he began pacing the deck
Tom hurt
he repeated to himself
Tom hurt
Howwhenwhat could have hurt her
He had seen her at the seawall only three days before rosycheeked magnificent in health and strength
What had happened
At the St George landing he jumped into a hack hurrying the cabman
Jennie was watching for him at the garden gate
She said her mother was in the sittingroom and Granpop was with her
As they walked up the path she recounted rapidly the events of the past two days
Tom was on the lounge by the window under the flowering plants when Babcock entered
She was apparently asleep
Across her forehead covering the temples two narrow bandages bound up her wound
At Babcocks step she opened her eyes her bruised discolored face breaking into a smile
Then noting his evident anxiety she threw the shawl from her shoulders and sat up
No dont look so
Its nothin Ill be all right in a day or two
Ive been hurted before but not so bad as this
I wouldnt have troubled ye but Mr Crane has gone West
It was kind and friendly o ye to come I knew ye would
Babcock nodded to Pop and sank into a chair
The shock of her appearance had completely unnerved him
Jennie has told me about it he said in a tender sympathetic tone
Who was mean enough to serve you in this way Tom
He called her Tom now as the others did
Well I wont say now
It may have been the horse but I hardly think it for I saw a face
All I remember clear is alayin me hand on the mares back
When I come to I was flat on the lounge
They had fixed me up and Dr Mason had gone off
Only the thick hood saved me
Carl and Cully searched the place but nothin could be found
Cully says he heard somebody arunnin on the other side of the fence but ye cant tell
Nobody keeps their heads in times like that
Have you been in bed ever since
Babcock asked
In bed
God rest ye
I was down to the board meetin two hours after wid Mr Crane and signed the contract
Jennie and all of em wouldnt have it and cried and went on but I braved em all
I knew I had to go if I died for it
Mr Crane had his buggy so I didnt have to walk
The stairs was the worst
Once inside I was all right
I only had to sign an come out again it didnt take a minute
Mr Crane stayed and fixed the bonds wid the trustees an I come home wid Carl and Jennie
Then turning to her father she said Granpop will ye and Jennie go into the kitchen for a while
Ive some private business wid Mr
Babcock
When they were gone her whole manner changed
She buried her face for a moment in the pillow covering her cheek with her hands then turning to Babcock she said Now me friend will ye lock the door
For some minutes she looked out of the window through the curtains and nasturtiums then in a low broken voice she said Im in great trouble
Will ye help me
Help you Tom
You know I will and with anything Ive got
What is it
he said earnestly regaining his chair and drawing it closer
Has no one iver told ye about me Tom
she asked looking at him from under her eyebrows
No except that he was hurt ororout of his mind maybe and you couldnt bring him home
An ye have heared nothin more
No said Babcock wondering at her anxious manner
Ye know that since he went away Ive done the work meself standin out as he would have done in the cold an wet an workin for the children wid nobody to help me but these two hands
Babcock nodded
He knew how true it was
Yeve wondered many a time maybe that I niver brought him home an had him round wid me other poor cripple Patsythem two togither
Her voice fell almost to a whisper
Or ye thought maybe it was mean and cruel in me that I kep him a burden on the State when I was able to care for him meself
Well yell think so no more
Babcock began to see now why he had been sent for
His heart went out to her all the more
Tom is your husband dead
he asked with a quiver in his voice
She never took her eyes from his face
Few people were ever tender with her they never seemed to think she needed it
She read this mans sincerity and sympathy in his eyes then she answered slowly He is Mr
Babcock
When did he die
Was it last night Tom
Listen to me fust an then Ill tell ye
Ye must know that when me Tom was hurted seven years ago we had a small place an only three horses and them warnt paid for an we had the haulin at the brewery an that was about all we did have
When Tom had been sick a monthit was the time the bucket fell an broke his ribthe new contract at the brewery was let for the year an Schwartz give it to us athinkin that Tomd be round agin an niver carin sos his work was done an I doin it me bein big an strong as I always was
Me Tom got worse an worse an I saw him afailin an one day Dr Mason stopped an said if I brought him to Bellevue Hospital where he had just been appointed hed fix up his rib so he could breathe easier and maybe hed get well
Well I hung on an on thinkin hed get betterpoor fellow he didnt want to gobut one night about dark I took the Big Gray an put him to the cart an bedded it down wid straw an I wrapped me Tom up in two blankits an carried him downstairs in me own arms an driv slow to the ferry
She hesitated for a moment leaned her bruised head on her hand and then went on When I got to Bellevue over by the river it was near ten oclock at night
Nobody stopped me or iver looked into me bundle of straw where me poor boy lay an I rung the bell an they came out an got him up into the ward an laid him on the bed
Dr Mason was on night duty an come an looked at him an said I must come over the next day an I kissed me poor Tom an left him tucked in promisin to be back early in the mornin
I had got only as far as the gate on the street whin one of the men came arunnin after me
I thought he had fainted and ran back as fast as I could but when I got me arms under him againhe was dead
And all this seven years ago Tom
said Babcock in astonishment sinking back in his chair
Tom bowed her head
The tears were trickling through her fingers and falling on the coarse shawl
Yis seven years ago this June
She paused for a moment as if the scene was passing before her in every detail and then went on Whin I come home I niver said a word to anybody but Jennie
Ive niver told Pop yit
Nobody else would have cared we was strangers here
The next mornin I took Jennieshe was a child thenan we wint over to the city an I got what money I had an the doctors helped an we buried him nobody but just us two Jennie an me walkin behint the wagon his poor body in the box
Whin I come home I wanted to die but I said nothin
I was afraid Schwartz would take the work away if he knew it was only a woman who was adoin it wid no man round an so I kep on an whin the neighbors asked about him bein in a sylum an out of his head an a cripple an all that God forgive me I was afraid to tell and I kept still and let it go at that an whin they asked me how he was Id say he was better or more comfortable or easier an so he was thank God
bein in heaven
She roused herself wearily and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand
Babcock sat motionless
Since that Ive kep the promise to me Tom that I made on me knees beside his bed the night I lifted him in me arms to take him downstairsthat I d keep his name clean and do by it as he would hev done himself an bring up the children an hold the roof over their heads
An now they say I darnt be called by Toms name nor sign it neither an theyre agoin to take me contract away for puttin his name at the bottom of it just as Ive put it on ivery other bit o paper Ive touched ink to these seven years since he left me
Why Tom this is nonsense
Who says so
said Babcock earnestly glad of any change of feeling to break the current of her thoughts
Dan McGaw an Rowan says so
Whats McGaw got to do with it
Hes out of the fight
Oh ye dont know some men Mr Babcock
McGawll never stop fightin while I live
Maybe I oughtnt tell yeIve niver told anybodybut whin my Tom lay sick upstairs McGaw come in one night an his own wife half dead with a blow he had given her an sat down in this very roomit was our kitchen thenan he says If your man dont git well yell be broke
An I says to him Dan McGaw if I live twelve months Tom Groganll be a richer man than he is now
I was asittin right here when I said it wid a rag carpet on this floor an hardly any furniture in the room
He said more things an tried to make love to me and I let drive and threw him out of me kitchen
Then all me trouble wid him began hes done everything to beat me since and now maybe after all hell down me
It all come up yisterday through McGaw meetin Dr Mason an askin him about me Tom an whin the doctor told him Tom was dead seven years McGaw runs to Justice Rowan wid the story an now they say I cant sign a dead mans name
Judge Bowker has the papers an its all to be settled tomorrow
But they cant take your contract away said Babcock indignantly no matter what Rowan says
Oh its not thatits not that
Thats not what hurts me
I can git another contract
Thats not what breaks me heart
But if they take me Toms NAME from me an say I cant be Tom Grogan any more its like robbin me of my life
When I work on the docks I allus brace myself an say Im doing just what Tom did many a day for me
When I sign his name to me checks an papersthe name Ive loved an that Ive worked for the name Ive kep clean for himme Tom that loved me an never lied or was meanme Tom that I promised anan All the woman in her overcame her now
Sinking to her knees she threw her arms and head on the lounge and burst into tears
Babcock rested his head on his hand and looked on in silence
Here was something it seemed to him too sacred for him to touch even with his sympathy
Tom he said when she grew more quiet his whole heart going out to her what do you want me to do
I dont know that ye can do anything she said in a quivering voice lifting her head her eyes still wet
Perhaps nobody can
But I thought maybe yed go wid me to Judge Bowker in the mornin
Rowan an all of em ll be there an Im no match for these lawyers
Perhaps yed speak to the judge for me
Babcock held out his hand
I knew ye would an I thank ye she said drying her eyes
Now unlock the door an let em in
They worry so
Granpop hasnt slep a night since I was hurted an Jennie goes round cryin all the time sayin they ll be akillin me next
Then rising to her feet she called out in a cheery voice as Babcock opened the door Come in Jennie come in Granpop
Its all over child
Mr Babcocks agoing wid me in the mornin
Niver fear well down em all yit
XVII A DANIEL COME TO JUDGMENT When Judge Bowker entered his office adjoining the village bank Justice Rowan had already arrived
So had McGaw Dempsey Crimmins Quigg the president of the board and one or two of the trustees
The judge had sent for McGaw and the president and they had notified the others
McGaw sat next to Dempsey
His extreme nervousness of a few days agostarting almost at the sound of his own footstephad given place to a certain air of bravado now that everybody in the village believed the horse had kicked Tom
Babcock and Tom were by the window she listless and weary he alert and watchful for the slightest point in her favor
She had on her brown dress washed clean of the bloodstains and the silk hood which better concealed the bruises
All her old fire and energy were gone
It was not from the shock of her woundher splendid constitution was fast healing thatbut from this deeper hurt this last thrust of McGaws which seemed to have broken her indomitable spirit
Babcock although he did not betray his misgivings was greatly worried over the outcome of McGaws latest scheme
He wished in his secret heart that Tom had signed her own name to the contract
He was afraid so punctilious a man as the judge might decide against her
He had never seen him he only knew that no other judge in his district had so great a reputation for technical rulings
When the judge entereda small grayhaired keeneyed man in a black suit with gold spectacles spotless linen and cleanshaven faceBabcocks fears were confirmed
This man he felt would be legally exact no matter who suffered by his decision
Rowan opened the case the judge listening attentively looking over his glasses
Rowan recounted the details of the advertisement the opening of the bids the award of the contract the signing of Thomas Grogan in the presence of the full board and the discovery by his honored client that no such man existed had not existed for years and did not now exist
Dead your Honorthrowing out his chest impressively his voice swellingdead in his grave these siven years this Mr Thomas Grogan and yet this woman has the bald and impudent effrontery to That will do Mr
Rowan
Police justicesjustices like Rowandid not count much with Judge Bowker and then he never permitted any one to abuse a woman in his presence
The point you make is that Mrs Grogan had no right to sign her name to a contract made out in the name of her dead husband
I do your Honor said Rowan resuming his seat
Why did you sign it
asked Judge Bowker turning to Tom
She looked at Babcock
He nodded assent and then she answered I allus signed it so since he left me
There was a pleading tender pathos in her words that startled Babcock
He could hardly believe the voice to be Toms
The judge looked at her with a quick penetrating glance which broadened into an expression of kindly interest when he read her entire honesty in her face
Then he turned to the president of the board
When you awarded this contract whom did you expect to do the work Mrs Grogan or her husband
 Mrs Grogan of course
She has done her own work for years answered the president
The judge tapped the arm of his chair with his pencil
The taps could be heard all over the room
Most men kept quiet in Bowkers presence even men like Rowan
For some moments his Honor bent over the desk and carefully examined the signed contract spread out before him then he pushed it back and glanced about the room
Is Mr Crane the bondsman present
Mr Crane has gone West sir said Babcock rising
I represent Mrs Grogan in this matter
Did Mr Crane sign this bond knowing that Mrs Grogan would haul the stone
He did and I can add that all her checks receipts and correspondence are signed in the same way and have been for years
She is known everywhere as Tom Grogan
She has never had any other namein her business
Who else objects to this award
said the judge calmly
Rowan sprang to his feet
The judge looked at him
Please sit down Justice Rowan
I said who else
I have heard you
He knew Rowan
Dempsey jumped from his chair
Im opposed to it yer Honor an so is all me frinds here
This woman has been invited into the Union and treats us as if we was dogs
She Are you a bidder for this work
asked the judge
No sir but the Union has rights and Please take your seat only bidders can be heard now
But whos to stand up for the rights of the laborin man if You can if you choose but not here
This is a question of evidence
Whos Bowker anyhow
said Dempsey behind his hand to Quigg
Ridin round in his carriage and chokin off free speech
After some moments of thought the judge turned to the president of the board and said in a measured deliberate voice This signature in my opinion is a proper one
No fraud is charged and under the testimony none was intended
The law gives Mrs Grogan the right to use any title she chooses in conducting her businessher husbands name or any other
The contract must stand as it is
Here the judge arose and entered his private office shutting the door behind him
Tom had listened with eyes dilating every nerve in her body at highest tension
Her contempt for Rowan in his abuse of her her anger against Dempsey at his insults her gratitude to Babcock as he stood up to defend her her fears for the outcome as she listened to the calm judicial voice of the judgeeach producing a different sensation of heat and coldwere all forgotten in the wild rush of joy that surged through her as the judges words fell upon her ear
She shed no tears as other women might have done
Every fibre of her being seemed to be turned to steel
She was herself againshe Tom Groganfirm on her own feet with her big arms ready to obey her and her head as clear as a bell master of herself master of her rights master of everything about her
And above all master of the dear name of her Tom that nothing could take from her nownot even the law
With this tightening of her will power there quivered through her a sense of her own wrongsthe wrongs she had endured for years the wrongs that had so nearly wrecked her life
Then forgetting the office the still solemnity of the placeeven Babcockshe walked straight up to McGaw blocking his exit to the street door
Dan McGaw theres a word Ive got for ye before ye lave this place an Im agoing to say it to ye now before ivery man in this room
McGaw shrank back in alarm
You an I have known each other since the time I nursed yer wife when yer boy Jack was born an helped her through when she was near dyin from a kick ye give her
Ye began yer dirty work on me one night when me Tom lay sick an I threw ye out o me kitchen an since that time yeve Here
I aint agoin ter stand here an listen ter yer
Git out o me way or Ill Tom stepped closer her eyes flashing every word ringing clear
Stand still an hear what Ive got to say to ye or Ill go into that room and make a statement to the judge thatll put ye where ye wont move for years
There was enough light for me to see
Look at thisdrawing back her hood and showing the bandaged scar
McGaw seemed to shrivel up the crowd stood still in amazement
I thought ye would
Now Ill go on
Since that night in me kitchen ye ve tried to ruin me in ivery other way ye could
Yeve set these dead beats Crimmins and Quigg on to me to coax away me men yeve stirred up the Union ye burned me stable Ye lie
Its a tramp did it snarled McGaw
Ye better keep still till I get through Dan McGaw
Ive got the can that helt the kersene an I know where yer boy Billy bought it an who set him up to it she added looking straight at Crimmins
He mighta been a dacent boy but for him
Crimmins turned pale and bit his lip
The situation became intense
Even the judge who had come out of his private room at the attack listened eagerly
Yeve been a sneak an a coward to serve a woman so who never harmed ye
Now I give ye fair warnin an I want two or three other men in this room to listen if this dont stop yell all be behint bars where ye belongI mean you too Mr Dempsey
As for you Dan McGaw if it warnt for yer wife Kate whos a dacent woman yed go today
Now one thing more an Ill let ye go
Ive bought yer chattel mortgage of Mr Crane thats past due an I can do wid it as I plase
Youll send to me in the mornin two of yer horses to take the places of those ye burned up an if theyre not in my stable by siven oclock Ill be round yer way bout nine with the sheriff
Once outside in the sunlight she became herself again
The outburst had cleared her soul like a thunderclap
She felt as free as air
The secret that had weighed her down for years was off her mind
What she had whispered to her own heart she could now proclaim from the housetops
Even the law protected her
Babcock walked beside her silent and grave
She seemed to him like some Joan with flaming sword
When they reached the road that led to her own house her eyes fell upon Jennie and Carl
They had walked down behind them and were waiting under the trees
Theres one thing more ye can do for me my friend she said turning to Babcock
All the old things Tom an I did togither I can do by meself but its new things like Carl an Jennie that trouble methe new things I cant ask him about
Do ye see them two yonder
Am I free to do for em as I would
No ye neednt answer
I see it in yer face
Come here child I want ye
Give me yer hand
For an instant she stood looking into their faces her eyes brimming
Then she took Jennies hand slipped it into Carls and laying her big strong palm over the two said slowly Now go home both o ye to the house thatll shelter ye plase God as long as ye live
 Before the highwaywork was finished McGaw was dead and Billy and Crimmins in Sing Sing
The label on the empty can Quiggs volunteered testimony and Judge Bowkers charge convinced the jury
Quigg had quarreled with Crimmins and the committee and took that way of getting even
When Tom heard the news she left her teams standing in the road and went straight to McGaws house
His widow sat on a broken chair in an almost empty room
Dont cry Katy said Tom bending over her
Im sorry for Billy
Seems to me yeve had a lot o trouble since Dan was drowned
It was not all Billys fault
It was Crimmins that put him up to it
But yeve one thing left and thats yer boy Jack
Let me take himIll make a man of him









Jack is still with her
Tom says he is the best man in her gang
