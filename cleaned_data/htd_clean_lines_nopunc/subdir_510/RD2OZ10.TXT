The Birthday Celebration To My Readers Well my dears here is what you have asked for another Oz Book about Dorothys strange adventures
Toto is in this story because you wanted him to be there and many other characters which you will recognize are in the story too
Indeed the wishes of my little correspondents have been considered as carefully as possible and if the story is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves you must remember that a story has to be a story before it can be written down and the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it
In the preface to Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz I said I would like to write some stories that were not Oz stories because I thought I had written about Oz long enough but since that volume was published I have been fairly deluged with letters from children imploring me to write more about Dorothy and more about Oz and since I write only to please the children I shall try to respect their wishes
There are some new characters in this book that ought to win your live
Im very fond of the shaggy man myself and I think you will like him too
As for Polychromethe Rainbows Daughterand stupid little ButtonBright they seem to have brought a new element of fun into these Oz stories and I am glad I discovered them
Yet I am anxious to have you write and tell me how you like them
Since this book was written I have received some very remarkable News from The Land of Oz which has greatly astonished me
I believe it will astonish you too my dears when you hear it
But it is such a long and exciting story that it must be saved for another bookand perhaps that book will be the last story that will ever be told about the Land of Oz

The Way to Butterfield Please miss said the shaggy man can you tell me the road to Butterfield
Dorothy looked him over
Yes he was shaggy all right but there was a twinkle in his eye that seemed pleasant
Oh yes she replied I can tell you
But it isnt this road at all
No
You cross the tenacre lot follow the lane to the highway go north to the five branches and takelet me see To be sure miss see as far as Butterfield if you like said the shaggy man
You take the branch next the willow stump I blieve or else the branch by the gopher holes or else Wont any of em do miss
Course not Shaggy Man
You must take the right road to get to Butterfield
And is that the one by the gopher stump or Dear me
cried Dorothy
I shall have to show you the way youre so stupid
Wait a minute till I run in the house and get my sunbonnet
The shaggy man waited
He had an oatstraw in his mouth which he chewed slowly as if it tasted good but it didnt
There was an appletree beside the house and some apples had fallen to the ground
The shaggy man thought they would taste better than the oatstraw so he walked over to get some
A little black dog with bright brown eyes dashed out of the farmhouse and ran madly toward the shaggy man who had already picked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide pockets of his shaggy coat
The little dog barked and made a dive for the shaggy mans leg but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big pocket along with the apples
He took more apples afterward for many were on the ground and each one that he tossed into his pocket hit the little dog somewhere upon the head or back and made him growl
The little dogs name was Toto and he was sorry he had been put in the shaggy mans pocket
Pretty soon Dorothy came out of the house with her sunbonnet and she called out Come on Shaggy Man if you want me to show you the road to Butterfield
She climbed the fence into the tenacre lot and he followed her walking slowly and stumbling over the little hillocks in the pasture as if he was thinking of something else and did not notice them
My but youre clumsy
said the little girl
Are your feet tired
No miss its my whiskers they tire very easily in this warm weather said he
I wish it would snow dont you
Course not Shaggy Man replied Dorothy giving him a severe look
If it snowed in August it would spoil the corn and the oats and the wheat and then Uncle Henry wouldnt have any crops and that would make him poor and Never mind said the shaggy man
It wont snow I guess
Is this the lane
Yes replied Dorothy climbing another fence Ill go as far as the highway with you
Thankee miss youre very kind for your size Im sure said he gratefully
It isnt everyone who knows the road to Butterfield Dorothy remarked as she tripped along the lane but Ive driven there many a time with Uncle Henry and so I blieve I could find it blindfolded
Dont do that miss said the shaggy man earnestly you might make a mistake
I wont she answered laughing
Heres the highway
Now its the secondno the third turn to the leftor else its the fourth
Lets see
The first one is by the elm tree and the second is by the gopher holes and then Then what
he inquired putting his hands in his coat pockets
Toto grabbed a finger and bit it the shaggy man took his hand out of that pocket quickly and said Oh
Dorothy did not notice
She was shading her eyes from the sun with her arm looking anxiously down the road
Come on she commanded
Its only a little way farther so I may as well show you
After a while they came to the place where five roads branched in different directions Dorothy pointed to one and said Thats it Shaggy Man
Im much obliged miss he said and started along another road
Not that one
she cried youre going wrong
He stopped
I thought you said that other was the road to Butterfield said he running his fingers through his shaggy whiskers in a puzzled way
So it is
But I dont want to go to Butterfield miss
You dont
Of course not
I wanted you to show me the road so I shouldnt go there by mistake
Oh
Where DO you want to go then
Im not particular miss
This answer astonished the little girl and it made her provoked too to think she had taken all this trouble for nothing
There are a good many roads here observed the shaggy man turning slowly around like a human windmill
Seems to me a person could go most anywhere from this place
Dorothy turned around too and gazed in surprise
There WERE a good many roads more than she had ever seen before
She tried to count them knowing there ought to be five but when she had counted seventeen she grew bewildered and stopped for the roads were as many as the spokes of a wheel and ran in every direction from the place where they stood so if she kept on counting she was likely to count some of the roads twice
Dear me
she exclaimed
There used to be only five roads highway and all
And nowwhy wheres the highway Shaggy Man
Cant say miss he responded sitting down upon the ground as if tired with standing
Wasnt it here a minute ago
I thought so she answered greatly perplexed
And I saw the gopher holes too and the dead stump but theyre not here now
These roads are all strangeand what a lot of them there are
Where do you suppose they all go to
Roads observed the shaggy man dont go anywhere
They stay in one place so folks can walk on them
He put his hand in his sidepocket and drew out an applequick before Toto could bite him again
The little dog got his head out this time and said Bowwow
so loudly that it made Dorothy jump
O Toto
she cried where did you come from
I brought him along said the shaggy man
What for
she asked
To guard these apples in my pocket miss so no one would steal them
With one hand the shaggy man held the apple which he began eating while with the other hand he pulled Toto out of his pocket and dropped him to the ground
Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once barking joyfully at his release from the dark pocket
When the child had patted his head lovingly he sat down before her his red tongue hanging out one side of his mouth and looked up into her face with his bright brown eyes as if asking her what they should do next
Dorothy didnt know
She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark but everything was strange
Between the branches of the many roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees but she couldnt see anywhere the farmhouse from which she had just come or anything she had ever seen beforeexcept the shaggy man and Toto
Besides this she had turned around and around so many times trying to find out where she was that now she couldnt even tell which direction the farmhouse ought to be in and this began to worry her and make her feel anxious
Im fraid Shaggy Man she said with a sigh that were lost
Thats nothing to be afraid of he replied throwing away the core of his apple and beginning to eat another one
Each of these roads must lead somewhere or it wouldnt be here
So what does it matter
I want to go home again she said
Well why dont you
said he
I dont know which road to take
That is too bad he said shaking his shaggy head gravely
I wish I could help you but I cant
Im a stranger in these parts
Seems as if I were too she said sitting down beside him
Its funny
A few minutes ago I was home and I just came to show you the way to Butterfield So I shouldnt make a mistake and go there And now Im lost myself and dont know how to get home
Have an apple suggested the shaggy man handing her one with pretty red cheeks
Im not hungry said Dorothy pushing it away
But you may be tomorrow then youll be sorry you didnt eat the apple said he
If I am Ill eat the apple then promised Dorothy
Perhaps there wont be any apple then he returned beginning to eat the redcheeked one himself
Dogs sometimes can find their way home better than people he went on perhaps your dog can lead you back to the farm
Will you Toto
asked Dorothy
Toto wagged his tail vigorously
All right said the girl lets go home
Toto looked around a minute and dashed up one of the roads
Goodbye Shaggy Man called Dorothy and ran after Toto
The little dog pranced briskly along for some distance when he turned around and looked at his mistress questioningly
Oh dont spect ME to tell you anything I dont know the way she said
Youll have to find it yourself
But Toto couldnt
He wagged his tail and sneezed and shook his ears and trotted back where they had left the shaggy man
From here he started along another road then came back and tried another but each time he found the way strange and decided it would not take them to the farmhouse
Finally when Dorothy had begun to tire with chasing after him Toto sat down panting beside the shaggy man and gave up
Dorothy sat down too very thoughtful
The little girl had encountered some queer adventures since she came to live at the farm but this was the queerest of them all
To get lost in fifteen minutes so near to her home and in the unromantic State of Kansas was an experience that fairly bewildered her
Will your folks worry
asked the shaggy man his eyes twinkling in a pleasant way
I spose so answered Dorothy with a sigh
Uncle Henry says theres ALWAYS something happening to me but Ive always come home safe at the last
So perhaps hell take comfort and think Ill come home safe this time
Im sure you will said the shaggy man smilingly nodding at her
Good little girls never come to any harm you know
For my part Im good too so nothing ever hurts me
Dorothy looked at him curiously
His clothes were shaggy his boots were shaggy and full of holes and his hair and whiskers were shaggy
But his smile was sweet and his eyes were kind
Why didnt you want to go to Butterfield
she asked
Because a man lives there who owes me fifteen cents and if I went to Butterfield and he saw me hed want to pay me the money
I dont want money my dear
Why not
she inquired
Money declared the shaggy man makes people proud and haughty
I dont want to be proud and haughty
All I want is to have people love me and as long as I own the Love Magnet everyone I meet is sure to love me dearly
The Love Magnet
Why whats that
Ill show you if you wont tell any one he answered in a low mysterious voice
There isnt any one to tell cept Toto said the girl
The shaggy man searched in one pocket carefully and in another pocket and in a third
At last he drew out a small parcel wrapped in crumpled paper and tied with a cotton string
He unwound the string opened the parcel and took out a bit of metal shaped like a horseshoe
It was dull and brown and not very pretty
This my dear said he impressively is the wonderful Love Magnet
It was given me by an Eskimo in the Sandwich Islandswhere there are no sandwiches at alland as long as I carry it every living thing I meet will love me dearly
Why didnt the Eskimo keep it
she asked looking at the Magnet with interest
He got tired of being loved and longed for some one to hate him
So he gave me the Magnet and the very next day a grizzly bear ate him
Wasnt he sorry then
she inquired
He didnt say replied the shaggy man wrapping and tying the Love Magnet with great care and putting it away in another pocket
But the bear didnt seem sorry a bit he added
Did you know the bear
asked Dorothy
Yes we used to play ball together in the Caviar Islands
The bear loved me because I had the Love Magnet
I couldnt blame him for eating the Eskimo because it was his nature to do so
Once said Dorothy I knew a Hungry Tiger who longed to eat fat babies because it was his nature to but he never ate any because he had a Conscience
This bear replied the shaggy man with a sigh had no Conscience you see
The shaggy man sat silent for several minutes apparently considering the cases of the bear and the tiger while Toto watched him with an air of great interest
The little dog was doubtless thinking of his ride in the shaggy mans pocket and planning to keep out of reach in the future
At last the shaggy man turned and inquired Whats your name little girl
My names Dorothy said she jumping up again but what are we going to do
We cant stay here forever you know
Lets take the seventh road he suggested
Seven is a lucky number for little girls named Dorothy
The seventh from where
From where you begin to count
So she counted seven roads and the seventh looked just like all the others but the shaggy man got up from the ground where he had been sitting and started down this road as if sure it was the best way to go and Dorothy and Toto followed him
2
Dorothy Meets ButtonBright The seventh road was a good road and curved this way and that winding through green meadows and fields covered with daisies and buttercups and past groups of shady trees
There were no houses of any sort to be seen and for some distance they met with no living creature at all
Dorothy began to fear they were getting a good way from the farmhouse since here everything was strange to her but it would do no good at all to go back where the other roads all met because the next one they chose might lead her just as far from home
She kept on beside the shaggy man who whistled cheerful tunes to beguile the journey until by and by they followed a turn in the road and saw before them a big chestnut tree making a shady spot over the highway
In the shade sat a little boy dressed in sailor clothes who was digging a hole in the earth with a bit of wood
He must have been digging some time because the hole was already big enough to drop a football into
Dorothy and Toto and the shaggy man came to a halt before the little boy who kept on digging in a sober and persistent fashion
Who are you
asked the girl
He looked up at her calmly
His face was round and chubby and his eyes were big blue and earnest
Im ButtonBright said he
But whats your real name
she inquired
ButtonBright
That isnt a reallytruly name
she exclaimed
Isnt it
he asked still digging
Course not
Its just aa thing to call you by
You must have a name
Must I
To be sure
What does your mama call you
He paused in his digging and tried to think
Papa always said I was bright as a button so mama always called me ButtonBright he said
What is your papas name
Just Papa
What else
Dont know
Never mind said the shaggy man smiling
Well call the boy ButtonBright as his mama does
That name is as good as any and better than some
Dorothy watched the boy dig
Where do you live
she asked
Dont know was the reply
How did you come here
Dont know he said again
Dont you know where you came from
No said he
Why he must be lost she said to the shaggy man
She turned to the boy once more
What are you going to do
she inquired
Dig said he
But you cant dig forever and what are you going to do then
she persisted
Dont know said the boy
But you MUST know SOMETHING declared Dorothy getting provoked
Must I
he asked looking up in surprise
Of course you must
What must I know
Whats going to become of you for one thing she answered
Do YOU know whats going to become of me
he asked
Notnot zactly she admitted
Do you know whats going to become of YOU
he continued earnestly
I cant say I do replied Dorothy remembering her present difficulties
The shaggy man laughed
No one knows everything Dorothy he said
But ButtonBright doesnt seem to know ANYthing she declared
Do you ButtonBright
He shook his head which had pretty curls all over it and replied with perfect calmness Dont know
Never before had Dorothy met with anyone who could give her so little information
The boy was evidently lost and his people would be sure to worry about him
He seemed two or three years younger than Dorothy and was prettily dressed as if someone loved him dearly and took much pains to make him look well
How then did he come to be in this lonely road
she wondered
Near ButtonBright on the ground lay a sailor hat with a gilt anchor on the band
His sailor trousers were long and wide at the bottom and the broad collar of his blouse had gold anchors sewed on its corners
The boy was still digging at his hole
Have you ever been to sea
asked Dorothy
To see what
answered ButtonBright
I mean have you ever been where theres water
Yes said ButtonBright theres a well in our back yard
You dont understand cried Dorothy
I mean have you ever been on a big ship floating on a big ocean
Dont know said he
Then why do you wear sailor clothes
Dont know he answered again
Dorothy was in despair
Youre just AWFUL stupid ButtonBright she said
Am I
he asked
Yes you are
Why
looking up at her with big eyes
She was going to say Dont know but stopped herself in time
Thats for you to answer she replied
Its no use asking ButtonBright questions said the shaggy man who had been eating another apple but someone ought to take care of the poor little chap dont you think
So hed better come along with us
Toto had been looking with great curiosity in the hole which the boy was digging and growing more and more excited every minute perhaps thinking that ButtonBright was after some wild animal
The little dog began barking loudly and jumped into the hole himself where he began to dig with his tiny paws making the earth fly in all directions
It spattered over the boy
Dorothy seized him and raised him to his feet brushing his clothes with her hand
Stop that Toto
she called
There arent any mice or woodchucks in that hole so dont be foolish
Toto stopped sniffed at the hole suspiciously and jumped out of it wagging his tail as if he had done something important
Well said the shaggy man lets start on or we wont get anywhere before night comes
Where do you expect to get to
asked Dorothy
Im like ButtonBright
I dont know answered the shaggy man with a laugh
But Ive learned from long experience that every road leads somewhere or there wouldnt be any road so its likely that if we travel long enough my dear we will come to some place or another in the end
What place it will be we cant even guess at this moment but were sure to find out when we get there
Why yes said Dorothy that seems reasnble Shaggy Man

A Queer Village ButtonBright took the shaggy mans hand willingly for the shaggy man had the Love Magnet you know which was the reason ButtonBright had loved him at once
They started on with Dorothy on one side and Toto on the other the little party trudging along more cheerfully than you might have supposed
The girl was getting used to queer adventures which interested her very much
Wherever Dorothy went Toto was sure to go like Marys little lamb
ButtonBright didnt seem a bit afraid or worried because he was lost and the shaggy man had no home perhaps and was as happy in one place as in another
Before long they saw ahead of them a fine big arch spanning the road and when they came nearer they found that the arch was beautifully carved and decorated with rich colors
A row of peacocks with spread tails ran along the top of it and all the feathers were gorgeously painted
In the center was a large foxs head and the fox wore a shrewd and knowing expression and had large spectacles over its eyes and a small golden crown with shiny points on top of its head
While the travelers were looking with curiosity at this beautiful arch there suddenly marched out of it a company of soldiersonly the soldiers were all foxes dressed in uniforms
They wore green jackets and yellow pantaloons and their little round caps and their high boots were a bright red color
Also there was a big red bow tied about the middle of each long bushy tail
Each soldier was armed with a wooden sword having an edge of sharp teeth set in a row and the sight of these teeth at first caused Dorothy to shudder
A captain marched in front of the company of foxsoldiers his uniform embroidered with gold braid to make it handsomer than the others
Almost before our friends realized it the soldiers had surrounded them on all sides and the captain was calling out in a harsh voice Surrender
You are our prisoners
Whats a prisner
asked ButtonBright
A prisoner is a captive replied the foxcaptain strutting up and down with much dignity
Whats a captive
asked ButtonBright
Youre one said the captain
That made the shaggy man laugh Good afternoon captain he said bowing politely to all the foxes and very low to their commander
I trust you are in good health and that your families are all well
The foxcaptain looked at the shaggy man and his sharp features grew pleasant and smiling
Were pretty well thank you Shaggy Man said he and Dorothy knew that the Love Magnet was working and that all the foxes now loved the shaggy man because of it
But Toto didnt know this for he began barking angrily and tried to bite the captains hairy leg where it showed between his red boots and his yellow pantaloons
Stop Toto
cried the little girl seizing the dog in her arms
These are our friends
Why so we are
remarked the captain in tones of astonishment
I thought at first we were enemies but it seems you are friends instead
You must come with me to see King Dox
Whos he
asked ButtonBright with earnest eyes
King Dox of Foxville the great and wise sovereign who rules over our community
Whats sovrin and whats cunity
inquired ButtonBright
Dont ask so many questions little boy
Why
Ah why indeed
exclaimed the captain looking at ButtonBright admiringly
If you dont ask questions you will learn nothing
True enough
I was wrong
Youre a very clever little boy come to think of itvery clever indeed
But now friends please come with me for it is my duty to escort you at once to the royal palace
The soldiers marched back through the arch again and with them marched the shaggy man Dorothy Toto and ButtonBright
Once through the opening they found a fine big city spread out before them all the houses of carved marble in beautiful colors
The decorations were mostly birds and other fowl such as peacocks pheasants turkeys prairiechickens ducks and geese
Over each doorway was carved a head representing the fox who lived in that house this effect being quite pretty and unusual
As our friends marched along some of the foxes came out on the porches and balconies to get a view of the strangers
These foxes were all handsomely dressed the girlfoxes and womenfoxes wearing gowns of feathers woven together effectively and colored in bright hues which Dorothy thought were quite artistic and decidedly attractive
ButtonBright stared until his eyes were big and round and he would have stumbled and fallen more than once had not the shaggy man grasped his hand tightly
They were all interested and Toto was so excited he wanted to bark every minute and to chase and fight every fox he caught sight of but Dorothy held his little wiggling body fast in her arms and commanded him to be good and behave himself
So he finally quieted down like a wise doggy deciding there were too many foxes in Foxville to fight at one time
Byandby they came to a big square and in the center of the square stood the royal palace
Dorothy knew it at once because it had over its great door the carved head of a fox just like the one she had seen on the arch and this fox was the only one who wore a golden crown
There were many foxsoldiers guarding the door but they bowed to the captain and admitted him without question
The captain led them through many rooms where richly dressed foxes were sitting on beautiful chairs or sipping tea which was being passed around by foxservants in white aprons
They came to a big doorway covered with heavy curtains of cloth of gold
Beside this doorway stood a huge drum
The foxcaptain went to this drum and knocked his knees against it first one knee and then the otherso that the drum said Boomboom
You must all do exactly what I do ordered the captain so the shaggy man pounded the drum with his knees and so did Dorothy and so did ButtonBright
The boy wanted to keep on pounding it with his little fat knees because he liked the sound of it but the captain stopped him
Toto couldnt pound the drum with his knees and he didnt know enough to wag his tail against it so Dorothy pounded the drum for him and that made him bark and when the little dog barked the foxcaptain scowled
The golden curtains drew back far enough to make an opening through which marched the captain with the others
The broad long room they entered was decorated in gold with stainedglass windows of splendid colors
In the corner of the room upon a richly carved golden throne sat the foxking surrounded by a group of other foxes all of whom wore great spectacles over their eyes making them look solemn and important
Dorothy knew the King at once because she had seen his head carved on the arch and over the doorway of the palace
Having met with several other kings in her travels she knew what to do and at once made a low bow before the throne
The shaggy man bowed too and ButtonBright bobbed his head and said Hello
Most wise and noble Potentate of Foxville said the captain addressing the King in a pompous voice I humbly beg to report that I found these strangers on the road leading to your Foxy Majestys dominions and have therefore brought them before you as is my duty
Soso said the King looking at them keenly
What brought you here strangers
Our legs may it please your Royal Hairiness replied the shaggy man
What is your business here
was the next question
To get away as soon as possible said the shaggy man
The King didnt know about the Magnet of course but it made him love the shaggy man at once
Do just as you please about going away he said but Id like to show you the sights of my city and to entertain your party while you are here
We feel highly honored to have little Dorothy with us I assure you and we appreciate her kindness in making us a visit
For whatever country Dorothy visits is sure to become famous
This speech greatly surprised the little girl who asked How did your Majesty know my name
Why everybody knows you my dear said the FoxKing
Dont you realize that
You are quite an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made you her friend
Do you know Ozma
she asked wondering
I regret to say that I do not he answered sadly but I hope to meet her soon
You know the Princess Ozma is to celebrate her birthday on the twentyfirst of this month
Is she
said Dorothy
I didnt know that
Yes it is to be the most brilliant royal ceremony ever held in any city in Fairyland and I hope you will try to get me an invitation
Dorothy thought a moment
Im sure Ozma would invite you if I asked her she said but how could you get to the Land of Oz and the Emerald City
Its a good way from Kansas
Kansas
he exclaimed surprised
Why yes we are in Kansas now arent we
she returned
What a queer notion
cried the FoxKing beginning to laugh
Whatever made you think this is Kansas
I left Uncle Henrys farm only about two hours ago thats the reason she said rather perplexed
But tell me my dear did you ever see so wonderful a city as Foxville in Kansas
he questioned
No your Majesty
And havent you traveled from Oz to Kansas in less than half a jiffy by means of the Silver Shoes and the Magic Belt
Yes your Majesty she acknowledged
Then why do you wonder that an hour or two could bring you to Foxville which is nearer to Oz than it is to Kansas
Dear me
exclaimed Dorothy is this another fairy adventure
It seems to be said the FoxKing smiling
Dorothy turned to the shaggy man and her face was grave and reproachful
Are you a magician
or a fairy in disguise
she asked
Did you enchant me when you asked the way to Butterfield
The shaggy man shook his head
Who ever heard of a shaggy fairy
he replied
No Dorothy my dear Im not to blame for this journey in any way I assure you
Theres been something strange about me ever since I owned the Love Magnet but I dont know what it is any more than you do
I didnt try to get you away from home at all
If you want to find your way back to the farm Ill go with you willingly and do my best to help you
Never mind said the little girl thoughtfully
There isnt so much to see in Kansas as there is here and I guess Aunt Em wont be VERY much worried that is if I dont stay away too long
Thats right declared the FoxKing nodding approval
Be contented with your lot whatever it happens to be if you are wise
Which reminds me that you have a new companion on this adventurehe looks very clever and bright
He is said Dorothy and the shaggy man added Thats his name your Royal FoxinessButtonBright

King Dox It was amusing to note the expression on the face of King Dox as he looked the boy over from his sailor hat to his stubby shoes and it was equally diverting to watch ButtonBright stare at the King in return
No fox ever beheld a fresher fairer childs face and no child had ever before heard a fox talk or met with one who dressed so handsomely and ruled so big a city
I am sorry to say that no one had ever told the little boy much about fairies of any kind this being the case it is easy to understand how much this strange experience startled and astonished him
How do you like us
asked the King
Dont know said ButtonBright
Of course you dont
Its too short an acquaintance returned his Majesty
What do you suppose my name is
Dont know said ButtonBright
How should you
Well Ill tell you
My private name is Dox but a King cant be called by his private name he has to take one that is official
Therefore my official name is King Renard the Fourth
Renard with the accent on the Ren
Whats ren
asked ButtonBright
How clever
exclaimed the King turning a pleased face toward his counselors
This boy is indeed remarkably bright
Whats ren
he asks and of course ren is nothing at all all by itself
Yes hes very bright indeed
That question is what your Majesty might call foxy said one of the counselors an old grey fox
So it is declared the King
Turning again to ButtonBright he asked Having told you my name what would you call me
King Dox said the boy
Why
Cause rens nothing at all was the reply
Good
Very good indeed
You certainly have a brilliant mind
Do you know why two and two make four
No said ButtonBright
Clever
clever indeed
Of course you dont know
Nobody knows why we only know its so and cant tell why its so
ButtonBright those curls and blue eyes do not go well with so much wisdom
They make you look too youthful and hide your real cleverness
Therefore I will do you a great favor
I will confer upon you the head of a fox so that you may hereafter look as bright as you really are
As he spoke the King waved his paw toward the boy and at once the pretty curls and fresh round face and big blue eyes were gone while in their place a foxs head appeared upon ButtonBrights shouldersa hairy head with a sharp nose pointed ears and keen little eyes
Oh dont do that
cried Dorothy shrinking back from her transformed companion with a shocked and dismayed face
Too late my dear its done
But you also shall have a foxs head if you can prove youre as clever as ButtonBright
I dont want it its dreadful
she exclaimed and hearing this verdict ButtonBright began to boohoo just as if he were still a little boy
How can you call that lovely head dreadful
asked the King
Its a much prettier face than he had before to my notion and my wife says Im a good judge of beauty
Dont cry little foxboy
Laugh and be proud because you are so highly favored
How do you like the new head ButtonBright
Dddont nnnknow
sobbed the child
Please PLEASE change him back again your Majesty
begged Dorothy
King Renard IV shook his head
I cant do that he said I havent the power even if I wanted to
No ButtonBright must wear his fox head and hell be sure to love it dearly as soon as he gets used to it
Both the shaggy man and Dorothy looked grave and anxious for they were sorrowful that such a misfortune had overtaken their little companion
Toto barked at the foxboy once or twice not realizing it was his former friend who now wore the animal head but Dorothy cuffed the dog and made him stop
As for the foxes they all seemed to think ButtonBrights new head very becoming and that their King had conferred a great honor on this little stranger
It was funny to see the boy reach up to feel of his sharp nose and wide mouth and wail afresh with grief
He wagged his ears in a comical manner and tears were in his little black eyes
But Dorothy couldnt laugh at her friend just yet because she felt so sorry
Just then three little foxprincesses daughters of the King entered the room and when they saw ButtonBright one exclaimed How lovely he is
and the next one cried in delight How sweet he is
and the third princess clapped her hands with pleasure and said How beautiful he is
ButtonBright stopped crying and asked timidly Am I
In all the world there is not another face so pretty declared the biggest foxprincess
You must live with us always and be our brother said the next
We shall all love you dearly the third said
This praise did much to comfort the boy and he looked around and tried to smile
It was a pitiful attempt because the fox face was new and stiff and Dorothy thought his expression more stupid than before the transformation
I think we ought to be going now said the shaggy man uneasily for he didnt know what the King might take into his head to do next
Dont leave us yet I beg of you pleaded King Renard
I intend to have several days of feasting and merrymaking in honor of your visit
Have it after were gone for we cant wait said Dorothy decidedly
But seeing this displeased the King she added If Im going to get Ozma to invite you to her party Ill have to find her as soon as possble you know
In spite of all the beauty of Foxville and the gorgeous dresses of its inhabitants both the girl and the shaggy man felt they were not quite safe there and would be glad to see the last of it
But it is now evening the King reminded them and you must stay with us until morning anyhow
Therefore I invite you to be my guests at dinner and to attend the theater afterward and sit in the royal box
Tomorrow morning if you really insist upon it you may resume your journey
They consented to this and some of the foxservants led them to a suite of lovely rooms in the big palace
ButtonBright was afraid to be left alone so Dorothy took him into her own room
While a maidfox dressed the little girls hairwhich was a bit tangledand put some bright fresh ribbons in it another maidfox combed the hair on poor ButtonBrights face and head and brushed it carefully tying a pink bow to each of his pointed ears
The maids wanted to dress the children in fine costumes of woven feathers such as all the foxes wore but neither of them consented to that
A sailor suit and a fox head do not go well together said one of the maids for no fox was ever a sailor that I can remember
Im not a fox
cried ButtonBright
Alas no agreed the maid
But youve got a lovely fox head on your skinny shoulders and thats ALMOST as good as being a fox
The boy reminded of his misfortune began to cry again
Dorothy petted and comforted him and promised to find some way to restore him his own head
If we can manage to get to Ozma she said the Princess will change you back to yourself in half a second so you just wear that fox head as comftbly as you can dear and dont worry about it at all
It isnt nearly as pretty as your own head no matter what the foxes say but you can get along with it for a little while longer cant you
Dont know said ButtonBright doubtfully but he didnt cry any more after that
Dorothy let the maids pin ribbons to her shoulders after which they were ready for the Kings dinner
When they met the shaggy man in the splendid drawing room of the palace they found him just the same as before
He had refused to give up his shaggy clothes for new ones because if he did that he would no longer be the shaggy man he said and he might have to get acquainted with himself all over again
He told Dorothy he had brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers but she thought he must have brushed them the wrong way for they were quite as shaggy as before
As for the company of foxes assembled to dine with the strangers they were most beautifully costumed and their rich dresses made Dorothys simple gown and ButtonBrights sailor suit and the shaggy mans shaggy clothes look commonplace
But they treated their guests with great respect and the Kings dinner was a very good dinner indeed
Foxes as you know are fond of chicken and other fowl so they served chicken soup and roasted turkey and stewed duck and fried grouse and broiled quail and goose pie and as the cooking was excellent the Kings guests enjoyed the meal and ate heartily of the various dishes
The party went to the theater where they saw a play acted by foxes dressed in costumes of brilliantly colored feathers
The play was about a foxgirl who was stolen by some wicked wolves and carried to their cave and just as they were about to kill her and eat her a company of foxsoldiers marched up saved the girl and put all the wicked wolves to death
How do you like it
the King asked Dorothy
Pretty well she answered
It reminds me of one of Mr Aesops fables
Dont mention Aesop to me I beg of you
exclaimed King Dox
I hate that mans name
He wrote a good deal about foxes but always made them out cruel and wicked whereas we are gentle and kind as you may see
But his fables showed you to be wise and clever and more shrewd than other animals said the shaggy man thoughtfully
So we are
There is no question about our knowing more than men do replied the King proudly
But we employ our wisdom to do good instead of harm so that horrid Aesop did not know what he was talking about
They did not like to contradict him because they felt he ought to know the nature of foxes better than men did so they sat still and watched the play and ButtonBright became so interested that for the time he forgot he wore a fox head
Afterward they went back to the palace and slept in soft beds stuffed with feathers for the foxes raised many fowl for food and used their feathers for clothing and to sleep upon
Dorothy wondered why the animals living in Foxville did not wear just their own hairy skins as wild foxes do when she mentioned it to King Dox he said they clothed themselves because they were civilized
But you were born without clothes she observed and you dont seem to me to need them
So were human beings born without clothes he replied and until they became civilized they wore only their natural skins
But to become civilized means to dress as elaborately and prettily as possible and to make a show of your clothes so your neighbors will envy you and for that reason both civilized foxes and civilized humans spend most of their time dressing themselves
I dont declared the shaggy man
That is true said the King looking at him carefully but perhaps you are not civilized
After a sound sleep and a good nights rest they had their breakfast with the King and then bade his Majesty goodbye
Youve been kind to uscept poor ButtonBright said Dorothy and weve had a nice time in Foxville
Then said King Dox perhaps youll be good enough to get me an invitation to Princess Ozmas birthday celebration
Ill try she promised if I see her in time
Its on the twentyfirst remember he continued and if youll just see that Im invited Ill find a way to cross the Dreadful Desert into the marvelous Land of Oz
Ive always wanted to visit the Emerald City so Im sure it was fortunate you arrived here just when you did you being Princess Ozmas friend and able to assist me in getting the invitation
If I see Ozma Ill ask her to invite you she replied
The FoxKing had a delightful luncheon put up for them which the shaggy man shoved in his pocket and the foxcaptain escorted them to an arch at the side of the village opposite the one by which they had entered
Here they found more soldiers guarding the road
Are you afraid of enemies
asked Dorothy
No because we are watchful and able to protect ourselves answered the captain
But this road leads to another village peopled by big stupid beasts who might cause us trouble if they thought we were afraid of them
What beasts are they
asked the shaggy man
The captain hesitated to answer
Finally he said You will learn all about them when you arrive at their city
But do not be afraid of them
ButtonBright is so wonderfully clever and has now such an intelligent face that Im sure he will manage to find a way to protect you
This made Dorothy and the shaggy man rather uneasy for they had not so much confidence in the foxboys wisdom as the captain seemed to have
But as their escort would say no more about the beasts they bade him goodbye and proceeded on their journey

The Rainbows Daughter Toto now allowed to run about as he pleased was glad to be free again and able to bark at the birds and chase the butterflies
The country around them was charming yet in the pretty fields of wildflowers and groves of leafy trees were no houses whatever or sign of any inhabitants
Birds flew through the air and cunning white rabbits darted amongst the tall grasses and green bushes Dorothy noticed even the ants toiling busily along the roadway bearing gigantic loads of clover seed but of people there were none at all
They walked briskly on for an hour or two for even little ButtonBright was a good walker and did not tire easily
At length as they turned a curve in the road they beheld just before them a curious sight
A little girl radiant and beautiful shapely as a fairy and exquisitely dressed was dancing gracefully in the middle of the lonely road whirling slowly this way and that her dainty feet twinkling in sprightly fashion
She was clad in flowing fluffy robes of soft material that reminded Dorothy of woven cobwebs only it was colored in soft tintings of violet rose topaz olive azure and white mingled together most harmoniously in stripes which melted one into the other with soft blendings
Her hair was like spun gold and flowed around her in a cloud no strand being fastened or confined by either pin or ornament or ribbon
Filled with wonder and admiration our friends approached and stood watching this fascinating dance
The girl was no taller than Dorothy although more slender nor did she seem any older than our little heroine
Suddenly she paused and abandoned the dance as if for the first time observing the presence of strangers
As she faced them shy as a frightened fawn poised upon one foot as if to fly the next instant Dorothy was astonished to see tears flowing from her violet eyes and trickling down her lovely rosehued cheeks
That the dainty maiden should dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising so Dorothy asked in a soft sympathetic voice Are you unhappy little girl
Very
was the reply I am lost
Why so are we said Dorothy smiling but we dont cry about it
Dont you
Why not
Cause Ive been lost before and always got found again answered Dorothy simply
But Ive never been lost before murmured the dainty maiden and Im worried and afraid
You were dancing remarked Dorothy in a puzzled tone of voice
Oh that was just to keep warm explained the maiden quickly
It was not because I felt happy or gay I assure you
Dorothy looked at her closely
Her gauzy flowing robes might not be very warm yet the weather wasnt at all chilly but rather mild and balmy like a spring day
Who are you dear
she asked gently
Im Polychrome was the reply
Polly whom
Polychrome
Im the Daughter of the Rainbow
Oh
said Dorothy with a gasp I didnt know the Rainbow had children
But I MIGHT have known it before you spoke
You couldnt really be anything else
Why not
inquired Polychrome as if surprised
Because youre so lovely and sweet
The little maiden smiled through her tears came up to Dorothy and placed her slender fingers in the Kansas girls chubby hand
Youll be my friendwont you
she said pleadingly
Of course
And what is your name
Im Dorothy and this is my friend Shaggy Man who owns the Love Magnet and this is ButtonBrightonly you dont see him as he really is because the FoxKing carelessly changed his head into a fox head
But the real ButtonBright is good to look at and I hope to get him changed back to himself some time
The Rainbows Daughter nodded cheerfully no longer afraid of her new companions
But who is this
she asked pointing to Toto who was sitting before her wagging his tail in the most friendly manner and admiring the pretty maid with his bright eyes
Is this also some enchanted person
Oh no PollyI may call you Polly maynt I
Your whole names awful hard to say
Call me Polly if you wish Dorothy
Well Polly Totos just a dog but he has more sense than ButtonBright to tell the truth and Im very fond of him
So am I said Polychrome bending gracefully to pat Totos head
But how did the Rainbows Daughter ever get on this lonely road and become lost
asked the shaggy man who had listened wonderingly to all this
Why my father stretched his rainbow over here this morning so that one end of it touched this road was the reply and I was dancing upon the pretty rays as I love to do and never noticed I was getting too far over the bend in the circle
Suddenly I began to slide and I went faster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground at the very end
Just then father lifted the rainbow again without noticing me at all and though I tried to seize the end of it and hold fast it melted away entirely and I was left alone and helpless on the cold hard earth
It doesnt seem cold to me Polly said Dorothy but perhaps youre not warmly dressed
Im so used to living nearer the sun replied the Rainbows Daughter that at first I feared I would freeze down here
But my dance has warmed me some and now I wonder how I am ever to get home again
Wont your father miss you and look for you and let down another rainbow for you
Perhaps so but hes busy just now because it rains in so many parts of the world at this season and he has to set his rainbow in a lot of different places
What would you advise me to do Dorothy
Come with us was the answer
Im going to try to find my way to the Emerald City which is in the fairy Land of Oz
The Emerald City is ruled by a friend of mine the Princess Ozma and if we can manage to get there Im sure she will know a way to send you home to your father again
Do you really think so
asked Polychrome anxiously
Im pretty sure
Then Ill go with you said the little maid for travel will help keep me warm and father can find me in one part of the world as well as anotherif he gets time to look for me
Come along then said the shaggy man cheerfully and they started on once more
Polly walked beside Dorothy a while holding her new friends hand as if she feared to let it go but her nature seemed as light and buoyant as her fleecy robes for suddenly she darted ahead and whirled round in a giddy dance
Then she tripped back to them with sparkling eyes and smiling cheeks having regained her usual happy mood and forgotten all her worry about being lost
They found her a charming companion and her dancing and laughter for she laughed at times like the tinkling of a silver belldid much to enliven their journey and keep them contented

The City Of Beasts When noon came they opened the FoxKings basket of luncheon and found a nice roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and some slices of bread and butter
As they sat on the grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up the turkey with his pocketknife and passed slices of it around
Havent you any dewdrops or mistcakes or cloudbuns
asked Polychrome longingly
Course not replied Dorothy
We eat solid things down here on the earth
But theres a bottle of cold tea
Try some wont you
The Rainbows Daughter watched ButtonBright devour one leg of the turkey
Is it good
she asked
He nodded
Do you think I could eat it
Not this said ButtonBright
But I mean another piece
Dont know he replied
Well Im going to try for Im very hungry she decided and took a thin slice of the white breast of turkey which the shaggy man cut for her as well as a bit of bread and butter
When she tasted it Polychrome thought the turkey was goodbetter even than mistcakes but a little satisfied her hunger and she finished with a tiny sip of cold tea
Thats about as much as a fly would eat said Dorothy who was making a good meal herself
But I know some people in Oz who eat nothing at all
Who are they
inquired the shaggy man
One is a scarecrow whos stuffed with straw and the other a woodman made out of tin
They havent any appetites inside of em you see so they never eat anything at all
Are they alive
asked ButtonBright
Oh yes replied Dorothy and theyre very clever and very nice too
If we get to Oz Ill introduce them to you
Do you really expect to get to Oz
inquired the shaggy man taking a drink of cold tea
I dont know just what to spect answered the child seriously but Ive noticed if I happen to get lost Im almost sure to come to the Land of Oz in the end somehow r other so I may get there this time
But I cant promise you know all I can do is wait and see
Will the Scarecrow scare me
asked ButtonBright
No cause youre not a crow she returned
He has the loveliest smile you ever sawonly its painted on and he cant help it
Luncheon being over they started again upon their journey the shaggy man Dorothy and ButtonBright walking soberly along side by side and the Rainbows Daughter dancing merrily before them
Sometimes she darted along the road so swiftly that she was nearly out of sight then she came tripping back to greet them with her silvery laughter
But once she came back more sedately to say Theres a city a little way off
I spected that returned Dorothy for the foxpeople warned us there was one on this road
Its filled with stupid beasts of some sort but we musnt be afraid of em cause they wont hurt us
All right said ButtonBright but Polychrome didnt know whether it was all right or not
Its a big city she said and the road runs straight through it
Never mind said the shaggy man as long as I carry the Love Magnet every living thing will love me and you may be sure I shant allow any of my friends to be harmed in any way
This comforted them somewhat and they moved on again
Pretty soon they came to a signpost that read HAF A MYLE TO DUNKITON
Oh said the shaggy man if theyre donkeys weve nothing to fear at all
They may kick said Dorothy doubtfully
Then we will cut some switches and make them behave he replied
At the first tree he cut himself a long slender switch from one of the branches and shorter switches for the others
Dont be afraid to order the beasts around he said theyre used to it
Before long the road brought them to the gates of the city
There was a high wall all around which had been whitewashed and the gate just before our travelers was a mere opening in the wall with no bars across it
No towers or steeples or domes showed above the enclosure nor was any living thing to be seen as our friends drew near
Suddenly as they were about to boldly enter through the opening there arose a harsh clamor of sound that swelled and echoed on every side until they were nearly deafened by the racket and had to put their fingers to their ears to keep the noise out
It was like the firing of many cannon only there were no cannonballs or other missiles to be seen it was like the rolling of mighty thunder only not a cloud was in the sky it was like the roar of countless breakers on a rugged seashore only there was no sea or other water anywhere about
They hesitated to advance but as the noise did no harm they entered through the whitewashed wall and quickly discovered the cause of the turmoil
Inside were suspended many sheets of tin or thin iron and against these metal sheets a row of donkeys were pounding their heels with vicious kicks
The shaggy man ran up to the nearest donkey and gave the beast a sharp blow with his switch
Stop that noise
he shouted and the donkey stopped kicking the metal sheet and turned its head to look with surprise at the shaggy man
He switched the next donkey and made him stop and then the next so that gradually the rattling of heels ceased and the awful noise subsided
The donkeys stood in a group and eyed the strangers with fear and trembling
What do you mean by making such a racket
asked the shaggy man sternly
We were scaring away the foxes said one of the donkeys meekly
Usually they run fast enough when they hear the noise which makes them afraid
There are no foxes here said the shaggy man
I beg to differ with you
Theres one anyhow replied the donkey sitting upright on its haunches and waving a hoof toward ButtonBright
We saw him coming and thought the whole army of foxes was marching to attack us
ButtonBright isnt a fox explained the shaggy man
Hes only wearing a fox head for a time until he can get his own head back
Oh I see remarked the donkey waving its left ear reflectively
Im sorry we made such a mistake and had all our work and worry for nothing
The other donkeys by this time were sitting up and examining the strangers with big glassy eyes
They made a queer picture indeed for they wore wide white collars around their necks and the collars had many scallops and points
The gentlemendonkeys wore high pointed caps set between their great ears and the ladydonkeys wore sunbonnets with holes cut in the top for the ears to stick through
But they had no other clothing except their hairy skins although many wore gold and silver bangles on their front wrists and bands of different metals on their rear ankles
When they were kicking they had braced themselves with their front legs but now they all stood or sat upright on their hind legs and used the front ones as arms
Having no fingers or hands the beasts were rather clumsy as you may guess but Dorothy was surprised to observe how many things they could do with their stiff heavy hoofs
Some of the donkeys were white some were brown or gray or black or spotted but their hair was sleek and smooth and their broad collars and caps gave them a neat if whimsical appearance
This is a nice way to welcome visitors I must say
remarked the shaggy man in a reproachful tone
Oh we did not mean to be impolite replied a grey donkey which had not spoken before
But you were not expected nor did you send in your visiting cards as it is proper to do
There is some truth in that admitted the shaggy man but now you are informed that we are important and distinguished travelers I trust you will accord us proper consideration
These big words delighted the donkeys and made them bow to the shaggy man with great respect
Said the grey one You shall be taken before his great and glorious Majesty King Kikabray who will greet you as becomes your exalted stations
Thats right answered Dorothy
Take us to some one who knows something
Oh we all know something my child or we shouldnt be donkeys asserted the grey one with dignity
The word donkey means clever you know
I didnt know it she replied
I thought it meant stupid
Not at all my child
If you will look in the Encyclopedia Donkaniara you will find Im correct
But come I will myself lead you before our splendid exalted and most intellectual ruler
All donkeys love big words so it is no wonder the grey one used so many of them

The Shaggy Mans Transformation They found the houses of the town all low and square and built of bricks neatly whitewashed inside and out
The houses were not set in rows forming regular streets but placed here and there in a haphazard manner which made it puzzling for a stranger to find his way
Stupid people must have streets and numbered houses in their cities to guide them where to go observed the grey donkey as he walked before the visitors on his hind legs in an awkward but comical manner but clever donkeys know their way about without such absurd marks
Moreover a mixed city is much prettier than one with straight streets
Dorothy did not agree with this but she said nothing to contradict it
Presently she saw a sign on a house that read Madam de Fayke Hoofist and she asked their conductor Whats a hoofist please
One who reads your fortune in your hoofs replied the grey donkey
Oh I see said the little girl
You are quite civilized here
Dunkiton he replied is the center of the worlds highest civilization
They came to a house where two youthful donkeys were whitewashing the wall and Dorothy stopped a moment to watch them
They dipped the ends of their tails which were much like paintbrushes into a pail of whitewash backed up against the house and wagged their tails right and left until the whitewash was rubbed on the wall after which they dipped these funny brushes in the pail again and repeated the performance
That must be fun said ButtonBright
No its work replied the old donkey but we make our youngsters do all the whitewashing to keep them out of mischief
Dont they go to school
asked Dorothy
All donkeys are born wise was the reply so the only school we need is the school of experience
Books are only for those who know nothing and so are obliged to learn things from other people
In other words the more stupid one is the more he thinks he knows observed the shaggy man
The grey donkey paid no attention to this speech because he had just stopped before a house which had painted over the doorway a pair of hoofs with a donkey tail between them and a rude crown and sceptre above
Ill see if his magnificent Majesty King Kikabray is at home said he
He lifted his head and called Wheehaw
wheehaw
wheehaw
three times in a shocking voice turning about and kicking with his heels against the panel of the door
For a time there was no reply then the door opened far enough to permit a donkeys head to stick out and look at them
It was a white head with big awful ears and round solemn eyes
Have the foxes gone
it asked in a trembling voice
They havent been here most stupendous Majesty replied the grey one
The new arrivals prove to be travelers of distinction
Oh said the King in a relieved tone of voice
Let them come in
He opened the door wide and the party marched into a big room which Dorothy thought looked quite unlike a kings palace
There were mats of woven grasses on the floor and the place was clean and neat but his Majesty had no other furniture at allperhaps because he didnt need it
He squatted down in the center of the room and a little brown donkey ran and brought a big gold crown which it placed on the monarchs head and a golden staff with a jeweled ball at the end of it which the King held between his front hoofs as he sat upright
Now then said his Majesty waving his long ears gently to and fro tell me why you are here and what you expect me to do for you
He eyed ButtonBright rather sharply as if afraid of the little boys queer head though it was the shaggy man who undertook to reply
Most noble and supreme ruler of Dunkiton he said trying not to laugh in the solemn Kings face we are strangers traveling through your dominions and have entered your magnificent city because the road led through it and there was no way to go around
All we desire is to pay our respects to your Majestythe cleverest king in all the world Im sureand then to continue on our way
This polite speech pleased the King very much indeed it pleased him so much that it proved an unlucky speech for the shaggy man
Perhaps the Love Magnet helped to win his Majestys affections as well as the flattery but however this may be the white donkey looked kindly upon the speaker and said Only a donkey should be able to use such fine big words and you are too wise and admirable in all ways to be a mere man
Also I feel that I love you as well as I do my own favored people so I will bestow upon you the greatest gift within my powera donkeys head
As he spoke he waved his jeweled staff
Although the shaggy man cried out and tried to leap backward and escape it proved of no use
Suddenly his own head was gone and a donkey head appeared in its placea brown shaggy head so absurd and droll that Dorothy and Polly both broke into merry laughter and even ButtonBrights fox face wore a smile
Dear me
dear me
cried the shaggy man feeling of his shaggy new head and his long ears
What a misfortunewhat a great misfortune
Give me back my own head you stupid kingif you love me at all
Dont you like it
asked the King surprised
Heehaw
I hate it
Take it away quick
said the shaggy man
But I cant do that was the reply
My magic works only one way
I can DO things but I cant UNdo them
Youll have to find the Truth Pond and bathe in its water in order to get back your own head
But I advise you not to do that
This head is much more beautiful than the old one
Thats a matter of taste said Dorothy
Where is the Truth Pond
asked the shaggy man earnestly
Somewhere in the Land of Oz but just the exact location of it I can not tell was the answer
Dont worry Shaggy Man said Dorothy smiling because her friend wagged his new ears so comically
If the Truth Pond is in Oz well be sure to find it when we get there
Oh
Are you going to the Land of Oz
asked King Kikabray
I dont know she replied but weve been told we are nearer the Land of Oz than to Kansas and if thats so the quickest way for me to get home is to find Ozma
Hawhaw
Do you know the mighty Princess Ozma
asked the King his tone both surprised and eager
Course I do shes my friend said Dorothy
Then perhaps youll do me a favor continued the white donkey much excited
What is it
she asked
Perhaps you can get me an invitation to Princess Ozmas birthday celebration which will be the grandest royal function ever held in Fairyland
Id love to go
Heehaw
You deserve punishment rather than reward for giving me this dreadful head said the shaggy man sorrowfully
I wish you wouldnt say heehaw so much Polychrome begged him it makes cold chills run down my back
But I cant help it my dear my donkey head wants to bray continually he replied
Doesnt your fox head want to yelp every minute
he asked ButtonBright
Dont know said the boy still staring at the shaggy mans ears
These seemed to interest him greatly and the sight also made him forget his own fox head which was a comfort
What do you think Polly
Shall I promise the donkey king an invitation to Ozmas party
asked Dorothy of the Rainbows Daughter who was flitting about the room like a sunbeam because she could never keep still
Do as you please dear answered Polychrome
He might help to amuse the guests of the Princess
Then if you will give us some supper and a place to sleep tonight and let us get started on our journey early tomorrow morning said Dorothy to the King Ill ask Ozma to invite youif I happen to get to Oz
Good
Heehaw
Excellent
cried Kikabray much pleased
You shall all have fine suppers and good beds
What food would you prefer a bran mash or ripe oats in the shell
Neither one replied Dorothy promptly
Perhaps plain hay or some sweet juicy grass would suit you better suggested Kikabray musingly
Is that all you have to eat
asked the girl
What more do you desire
Well you see were not donkeys she explained and so were used to other food
The foxes gave us a nice supper in Foxville
Wed like some dewdrops and mistcakes said Polychrome
Id prefer apples and a ham sandwich declared the shaggy man for although Ive a donkey head I still have my own particular stomach
I want pie said ButtonBright
I think some beefsteak and chocolate layercake would taste best said Dorothy
Heehaw
I declare
exclaimed the King
It seems each one of you wants a different food
How queer all living creatures are except donkeys
And donkeys like you are queerest of all laughed Polychrome
Well decided the King I suppose my Magic Staff will produce the things you crave if you are lacking in good taste it is not my fault
With this he waved his staff with the jeweled ball and before them instantly appeared a teatable set with linen and pretty dishes and on the table were the very things each had wished for
Dorothys beefsteak was smoking hot and the shaggy mans apples were plump and rosycheeked
The King had not thought to provide chairs so they all stood in their places around the table and ate with good appetite being hungry
The Rainbows Daughter found three tiny dewdrops on a crystal plate and ButtonBright had a big slice of apple pie which he devoured eagerly
Afterward the King called the brown donkey which was his favorite servant and bade it lead his guests to the vacant house where they were to pass the night
It had only one room and no furniture except beds of clean straw and a few mats of woven grasses but our travelers were contented with these simple things because they realized it was the best the DonkeyKing had to offer them
As soon as it was dark they lay down on the mats and slept comfortably until morning
At daybreak there was a dreadful noise throughout the city
Every donkey in the place brayed
When he heard this the shaggy man woke up and called out Heehaw
as loud as he could
Stop that
said ButtonBright in a cross voice
Both Dorothy and Polly looked at the shaggy man reproachfully
I couldnt help it my dears he said as if ashamed of his bray but Ill try not to do it again
Of coursed they forgave him for as he still had the Love Magnet in his pocket they were all obliged to love him as much as ever
They did not see the King again but Kikabray remembered them for a table appeared again in their room with the same food upon it as on the night before
Dont want pie for breakfus said ButtonBright
Ill give you some of my beefsteak proposed Dorothy theres plenty for us all
That suited the boy better but the shaggy man said he was content with his apples and sandwiches although he ended the meal by eating ButtonBrights pie
Polly liked her dewdrops and mistcakes better than any other food so they all enjoyed an excellent breakfast
Toto had the scraps left from the beefsteak and he stood up nicely on his hind legs while Dorothy fed them to him
Breakfast ended they passed through the village to the side opposite that by which they had entered the brown servantdonkey guiding them through the maze of scattered houses
There was the road again leading far away into the unknown country beyond
King Kikabray says you must not forget his invitation said the brown donkey as they passed through the opening in the wall
I shant promised Dorothy
Perhaps no one ever beheld a more strangely assorted group than the one which now walked along the road through pretty green fields and past groves of feathery peppertrees and fragrant mimosa
Polychrome her beautiful gauzy robes floating around her like a rainbow cloud went first dancing back and forth and darting now here to pluck a wildflower or there to watch a beetle crawl across the path
Toto ran after her at times barking joyously the while only to become sober again and trot along at Dorothys heels
The little Kansas girl walked holding ButtonBrights hand clasped in her own and the wee boy with his fox head covered by the sailor hat presented an odd appeaance
Strangest of all perhaps was the shaggy man with his shaggy donkey head who shuffled along in the rear with his hands thrust deep in his big pockets
None of the party was really unhappy
All were straying in an unknown land and had suffered more or less annoyance and discomfort but they realized they were having a fairy adventure in a fairy country and were much interested in finding out what would happen next

The Musicker About the middle of the forenoon they began to go up a long hill
Byandby this hill suddenly dropped down into a pretty valley where the travelers saw to their surprise a small house standing by the roadside
It was the first house they had seen and they hastened into the valley to discover who lived there
No one was in sight as they approached but when they began to get nearer the house they heard queer sounds coming from it
They could not make these out at first but as they became louder our friends thought they heard a sort of music like that made by a wheezy handorgan the music fell upon their ears in this way Tiddlewiddleiddle oom pompom
Oom pompom
oom pompom
Tiddletiddletiddle oom pompom
Oom pompompah
What is it a band or a mouthorgan
asked Dorothy
Dont know said ButtonBright
Sounds to me like a playedout phonograph said the shaggy man lifting his enormous ears to listen
Oh there just COULDNT be a funnygraf in Fairyland
cried Dorothy
Its rather pretty isnt it
asked Polychrome trying to dance to the strains
Tiddlewiddleiddle oom pompom Oom pompom oom pompom
came the music to their ears more distinctly as they drew nearer the house
Presently they saw a little fat man sitting on a bench before the door
He wore a red braided jacket that reached to his waist a blue waistcoat and white trousers with gold stripes down the sides
On his bald head was perched a little round red cap held in place by a rubber elastic underneath his chin
His face was round his eyes a faded blue and he wore white cotton gloves
The man leaned on a stout goldheaded cane bending forward on his seat to watch his visitors approach
Singularly enough the musical sounds they had heard seemed to come from the inside of the fat man himself for he was playing no instrument nor was any to be seen near him
They came up and stood in a row staring at him and he stared back while the queer sounds came from him as before Tiddleiddleiddle oom pompom Oom pompom oom pompom
Tiddlewiddleiddle oom pompom Oom pompompah
Why hes a reglar musicker
said ButtonBright
Whats a musicker
asked Dorothy
Him
said the boy
Hearing this the fat man sat up a little stiffer than before as if he had received a compliment and still came the sounds Tiddlewiddleiddle oom pompom Oom pompom oom Stop it
cried the shaggy man earnestly
Stop that dreadful noise
The fat man looked at him sadly and began his reply
When he spoke the music changed and the words seemed to accompany the notes
He saidor rather sang It isnt a noise that you hear But Music harmonic and clear
My breath makes me play Like an organ all day That bass note is in my left ear
How funny
exclaimed Dorothy he says his breath makes the music
Thats all nonsense declared the shaggy man but now the music began again and they all listened carefully
My lungs are full of reeds like those In organs therefore I suppose If I breathe in or out my nose The reeds are bound to play
So as I breathe to live you know I squeeze out music as I go Im very sorry this is so Forgive my piping pray
Poor man said Polychrome he cant help it
What a great misfortune it is
Yes replied the shaggy man we are only obliged to hear this music a short time until we leave him and go away but the poor fellow must listen to himself as long as he lives and that is enough to drive him crazy
Dont you think so
Dont know said ButtonBright
Toto said Bowwow
and the others laughed
Perhaps thats why he lives all alone suggested Dorothy
Yes if he had neighbors they might do him an injury responded the shaggy man
All this while the little fat musicker was breathing the notes Tiddletiddleiddle oom pompom and they had to speak loud in order to hear themselves
The shaggy man said Who are you sir
The reply came in the shape of this singsong Im Allegro da Capo a very famous man Just find another high or low to match me if you can
Some people try but cant to play And have to practice every day But Ive been musical always since first my life began
Why I blieve hes proud of it exclaimed Dorothy and seems to me Ive heard worse music than he makes
Where
asked ButtonBright
Ive forgotten just now
But Mr Da Capo is certainly a strange personisnt heand praps hes the only one of his kind in all the world
This praise seemed to please the little fat musicker for he swelled out his chest looked important and sang as follows I wear no band around me And yet I am a band
I do not strain to make my strains But on the other hand My toot is always destitute Of flats or other errors To see sharp and be natural are For me but minor terrors
I dont quite understand that said Polychrome with a puzzled look but perhaps its because Im accustomed only to the music of the spheres
Whats that
asked ButtonBright
Oh Polly means the atmosphere and hemisphere I spose explained Dorothy
Oh said ButtonBright
Bowwow
said Toto
But the musicker was still breathing his constant Oom pompom Oom pompom and it seemed to jar on the shaggy mans nerves
Stop it cant you
he cried angrily or breathe in a whisper or put a clothespin on your nose
Do something anyhow
But the fat one with a sad look sang this answer Music hath charms and it may Soothe even the savage they say So if savage you feel Just list to my reel For sooth to say thats the real way
The shaggy man had to laugh at this and when he laughed he stretched his donkey mouth wide open
Said Dorothy I dont know how good his poetry is but it seems to fit the notes so thats all that can be xpected
I like it said ButtonBright who was staring hard at the musicker his little legs spread wide apart
To the surprise of his companions the boy asked this long question If I swallowed a mouthorgan what would I be
An organette said the shaggy man
But come my dears I think the best thing we can do is to continue on our journey before ButtonBright swallows anything
We must try to find that Land of Oz you know
Hearing this speech the musicker sang quickly If you go to the Land of Oz Please take me along because On Ozmas birthday Im anxious to play The loveliest song ever was
No thank you said Dorothy we prefer to travel alone
But if I see Ozma Ill tell her you want to come to her birthday party
Lets be going urged the shaggy man anxiously
Polly was already dancing along the road far in advance and the others turned to follow her
Toto did not like the fat musicker and made a grab for his chubby leg
Dorothy quickly caught up the growling little dog and hurried after her companions who were walking faster than usual in order to get out of hearing
They had to climb a hill and until they got to the top they could not escape the musickers monotonous piping Oom pompom oom pompom Tiddleiddlewiddle oom pompom Oom pompompah
As they passed the brow of the hill however and descended on the other side the sounds gradually died away whereat they all felt much relieved
Im glad I dont have to live with the organman arent you Polly
said Dorothy
Yes indeed answered the Rainbows Daughter
Hes nice declared ButtonBright soberly
I hope your Princess Ozma wont invite him to her birthday celebration remarked the shaggy man for the fellows music would drive her guests all crazy
Youve given me an idea ButtonBright I believe the musicker must have swallowed an accordeon in his youth
Whats cordeon
asked the boy
Its a kind of pleating explained Dorothy putting down the dog
Bowwow
said Toto and ran away at a mad gallop to chase a bumblebee

Facing the Scoodlers The country wasnt so pretty now
Before the travelers appeared a rocky plain covered with hills on which grew nothing green
They were nearing some low mountains too and the road which before had been smooth and pleasant to walk upon grew rough and uneven
ButtonBrights little feet stumbled more than once and Polychrome ceased her dancing because the walking was now so difficult that she had no trouble to keep warm
It had become afternoon yet there wasnt a thing for their luncheon except two apples which the shaggy man had taken from the breakfast table
He divided these into four pieces and gave a portion to each of his companions
Dorothy and ButtonBright were glad to get theirs but Polly was satisfied with a small bite and Toto did not like apples
Do you know asked the Rainbows Daughter if this is the right road to the Emerald City
No I dont replied Dorothy but its the only road in this part of the country so we may as well go to the end of it
It looks now as if it might end pretty soon remarked the shaggy man and what shall we do if it does
Dont know said ButtonBright
If I had my Magic Belt replied Dorothy thoughtfully it could do us a lot of good just now
What is your Magic Belt
asked Polychrome
Its a thing I captured from the Nome King one day and it can do most any wonderful thing
But I left it with Ozma you know cause magic wont work in Kansas but only in fairy countries
Is this a fairy country
asked ButtonBright
I should think youd know said the little girl gravely
If it wasnt a fairy country you couldnt have a fox head and the shaggy man couldnt have a donkey head and the Rainbows Daughter would be invisble
Whats that
asked the boy
You dont seem to know anything ButtonBright
Invisble is a thing you cant see
Then Totos invisble declared the boy and Dorothy found he was right
Toto had disappeared from view but they could hear him barking furiously among the heaps of grey rock ahead of them
They moved forward a little faster to see what the dog was barking at and found perched upon a point of rock by the roadside a curious creature
It had the form of a man middlesized and rather slender and graceful but as it sat silent and motionless upon the peak they could see that its face was black as ink and it wore a black cloth costume made like a union suit and fitting tight to its skin
Its hands were black too and its toes curled down like a birds
The creature was black all over except its hair which was fine and yellow banged in front across the black forehead and cut close at the sides
The eyes which were fixed steadily upon the barking dog were small and sparkling and looked like the eyes of a weasel
What in the world do you spose that is
asked Dorothy in a hushed voice as the little group of travelers stood watching the strange creature
Dont know said ButtonBright
The thing gave a jump and turned half around sitting in the same place but with the other side of its body facing them
Instead of being black it was now pure white with a face like that of a clown in a circus and hair of a brilliant purple
The creature could bend either way and its white toes now curled the same way the black ones on the other side had done
It has a face both front and back whispered Dorothy wonderingly only theres no back at all but two fronts
Having made the turn the being sat motionless as before while Toto barked louder at the white man than he had done at the black one
Once said the shaggy man I had a jumping jack like that with two faces
Was it alive
asked ButtonBright
No replied the shaggy man it worked on strings and was made of wood
Wonder if this works with strings said Dorothy but Polychrome cried Look
for another creature just like the first had suddenly appeared sitting on another rock its black side toward them
The two twisted their heads around and showed a black face on the white side of one and a white face on the black side of the other
How curious said Polychrome and how loose their heads seem to be
Are they friendly to us do you think
Cant tell Polly replied Dorothy
Lets ask em
The creatures flopped first one way and then the other showing black or white by turns and now another joined them appearing on another rock
Our friends had come to a little hollow in the hills and the place where they now stood was surrounded by jagged peaks of rock except where the road ran through
Now there are four of them said the shaggy man
Five declared Polychrome
Six said Dorothy
Lots of em
cried ButtonBright and so there werequite a row of the twosided black and white creatures sitting on the rocks all around
Toto stopped barking and ran between Dorothys feet where he crouched down as if afraid
The creatures did not look pleasant or friendly to be sure and the shaggy mans donkey face became solemn indeed
Ask em who they are and what they want whispered Dorothy so the shaggy man called out in a loud voice Who are you
Scoodlers
they yelled in chorus their voices sharp and shrill
What do you want
called the shaggy man
You
they yelled pointing their thin fingers at the group and they all flopped around so they were white and then all flopped back again so they were black
But what do you want us for
asked the shaggy man uneasily
Soup
they all shouted as if with one voice
Goodness me
said Dorothy trembling a little the Scoodlers must be reglar cannibals
Dont want to be soup protested ButtonBright beginning to cry
Hush dear said the little girl trying to comfort him we dont any of us want to be soup
But dont worry the shaggy man will take care of us
Will he
asked Polychrome who did not like the Scoodlers at all and kept close to Dorothy
Ill try promised the shaggy man but he looked worried
Happening just then to feel the Love Magnet in his pocket he said to the creatures with more confidence Dont you love me
Yes
they shouted all together
Then you mustnt harm me or my friends said the shaggy man firmly
We love you in soup
they yelled and in a flash turned their white sides to the front
How dreadful
said Dorothy
This is a time Shaggy Man when you get loved too much
Dont want to be soup
wailed ButtonBright again and Toto began to whine dismally as if he didnt want to be soup either
The only thing to do said the shaggy man to his friends in a low tone is to get out of this pocket in the rocks as soon as we can and leave the Scoodlers behind us
Follow me my dears and dont pay any attention to what they do or say
With this he began to march along the road to the opening in the rocks ahead and the others kept close behind him
But the Scoodlers closed up in front as if to bar their way and so the shaggy man stooped down and picked up a loose stone which he threw at the creatures to scare them from the path
At this the Scoodlers raised a howl
Two of them picked their heads from their shoulders and hurled them at the shaggy man with such force that he fell over in a heap greatly astonished
The two now ran forward with swift leaps caught up their heads and put them on again after which they sprang back to their positions on the rocks
10
Escaping the SoupKettle The shaggy man got up and felt of himself to see if he was hurt but he was not
One of the heads had struck his breast and the other his left shoulder yet though they had knocked him down the heads were not hard enough to bruise him
Come on he said firmly weve got to get out of here some way and forward he started again
The Scoodlers began yelling and throwing their heads in great numbers at our frightened friends
The shaggy man was knocked over again and so was ButtonBright who kicked his heels against the ground and howled as loud as he could although he was not hurt a bit
One head struck Toto who first yelped and then grabbed the head by an ear and started running away with it
The Scoodlers who had thrown their heads began to scramble down and run to pick them up with wonderful quickness but the one whose head Toto had stolen found it hard to get it back again
The head couldnt see the body with either pair of its eyes because the dog was in the way so the headless Scoodler stumbled around over the rocks and tripped on them more than once in its effort to regain its top
Toto was trying to get outside the rocks and roll the head down the hill but some of the other Scoodlers came to the rescue of their unfortunate comrade and pelted the dog with their own heads until he was obliged to drop his burden and hurry back to Dorothy
The little girl and the Rainbows Daughter had both escaped the shower of heads but they saw now that it would be useless to try to run away from the dreadful Scoodlers
We may as well submit declared the shaggy man in a rueful voice as he got upon his feet again
He turned toward their foes and asked What do you want us to do
Come
they cried in a triumphant chorus and at once sprang from the rocks and surrounded their captives on all sides
One funny thing about the Scoodlers was they could walk in either direction coming or going without turning around because they had two faces and as Dorothy said two front sides and their feet were shaped like the letter T upside down
They moved with great rapidity and there was something about their glittering eyes and contrasting colors and removable heads that inspired the poor prisoners with horror and made them long to escape
But the creatures led their captives away from the rocks and the road down the hill by a side path until they came before a low mountain of rock that looked like a huge bowl turned upside down
At the edge of this mountain was a deep gulfso deep that when you looked into it there was nothing but blackness below
Across the gulf was a narrow bridge of rock and at the other end of the bridge was an arched opening that led into the mountain
Over this bridge the Scoodlers led their prisoners through the opening into the mountain which they found to be an immense hollow dome lighted by several holes in the roof
All around the circular space were built rock houses set close together each with a door in the front wall
None of these houses was more than six feet wide but the Scoodlers were thin people sidewise and did not need much room
So vast was the dome that there was a large space in the middle of the cave in front of all these houses where the creatures might congregate as in a great hall
It made Dorothy shudder to see a huge iron kettle suspended by a stout chain in the middle of the place and underneath the kettle a great heap of kindling wood and shavings ready to light
Whats that
asked the shaggy man drawing back as they approached this place so that they were forced to push him forward
The Soup Kettle
yelled the Scoodlers and then they shouted in the next breath Were hungry
ButtonBright holding Dorothys hand in one chubby fist and Pollys hand in the other was so affected by this shout that he began to cry again repeating the protest Dont want to be soup I dont
Never mind said the shaggy man consolingly I ought to make enough soup to feed them all Im so big so Ill ask them to put me in the kettle first
All right said ButtonBright more cheerfully
But the Scoodlers were not ready to make soup yet
They led the captives into a house at the farthest side of the cavea house somewhat wider than the others
Who lives here
asked the Rainbows Daughter
The Scoodlers nearest her replied The Queen
It made Dorothy hopeful to learn that a woman ruled over these fierce creatures but a moment later they were ushered by two or three of the escort into a gloomy bare roomand her hope died away
For the Queen of the Scoodlers proved to be much more dreadful in appearance than any of her people
One side of her was fiery red with jetblack hair and green eyes and the other side of her was bright yellow with crimson hair and black eyes
She wore a short skirt of red and yellow and her hair instead of being banged was a tangle of short curls upon which rested a circular crown of silvermuch dented and twisted because the Queen had thrown her head at so many things so many times
Her form was lean and bony and both her faces were deeply wrinkled
What have we here
asked the Queen sharply as our friends were made to stand before her
Soup
cried the guard of Scoodlers speaking together
Were not
said Dorothy indignantly were nothing of the sort
Ah but you will be soon retorted the Queen a grim smile making her look more dreadful than before
Pardon me most beautiful vision said the shaggy man bowing before the queen politely
I must request your Serene Highness to let us go our way without being made into soup
For I own the Love Magnet and whoever meets me must love me and all my friends
True replied the Queen
We love you very much so much that we intend to eat your broth with real pleasure
But tell me do you think I am so beautiful
You wont be at all beautiful if you eat me he said shaking his head sadly
Handsome is as handsome does you know
The Queen turned to ButtonBright
Do YOU think Im beautiful
she asked
No said the boy youre ugly
I think youre a fright said Dorothy
If you could see yourself youd be terribly scared added Polly
The Queen scowled at them and flopped from her red side to her yellow side
Take them away she commanded the guard and at six oclock run them through the meat chopper and start the soup kettle boiling
And put plenty of salt in the broth this time or Ill punish the cooks severely
Any onions your Majesty
asked one of the guard
Plenty of onions and garlic and a dash of red pepper
Now go
The Scoodlers led the captives away and shut them up in one of the houses leaving only a single Scoodler to keep guard
The place was a sort of storehouse containing bags of potatoes and baskets of carrots onions and turnips
These said their guard pointing to the vegetables we use to flavor our soups with
The prisoners were rather disheartened by this time for they saw no way to escape and did not know how soon it would be six oclock and time for the meatchopper to begin work
But the shaggy man was brave and did not intend to submit to such a horrid fate without a struggle
Im going to fight for our lives he whispered to the children for if I fail we will be no worse off than before and to sit here quietly until we are made into soup would be foolish and cowardly
The Scoodler on guard stood near the doorway turning first his white side toward them and then his black side as if he wanted to show to all of his greedy four eyes the sight of so many fat prisoners
The captives sat in a sorrowful group at the other end of the roomexcept Polychrome who danced back and forth in the little place to keep herself warm for she felt the chill of the cave
Whenever she approached the shaggy man he would whisper something in her ear and Polly would nod her pretty head as if she understood
The shaggy man told Dorothy and ButtonBright to stand before him while he emptied the potatoes out of one of the sacks
When this had been secretly done little Polychrome dancing near to the guard suddenly reached out her hand and slapped his face the next instant whirling away from him quickly to rejoin her friends
The angry Scoodler at once picked off his head and hurled it at the Rainbows Daughter but the shaggy man was expecting that and caught the head very neatly putting it in the sack which he tied at the mouth
The body of the guard not having the eyes of its head to guide it ran here and there in an aimless manner and the shaggy man easily dodged it and opened the door
Fortunately there was no one in the big cave at that moment so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as they could for the entrance and out across the narrow bridge
Ill carry ButtonBright he said for he knew the little boys legs were too short to run fast
Dorothy picked up Toto and then seized Pollys hand and ran swiftly toward the entrance to the cave
The shaggy man perched ButtonBright on his shoulders and ran after them
They moved so quickly and their escape was so wholly unexpected that they had almost reached the bridge when one of the Scoodlers looked out of his house and saw them
The creature raised a shrill cry that brought all of its fellows bounding out of the numerous doors and at once they started in chase
Dorothy and Polly had reached the bridge and crossed it when the Scoodlers began throwing their heads
One of the queer missiles struck the shaggy man on his back and nearly knocked him over but he was at the mouth of the cave now so he set down ButtonBright and told the boy to run across the bridge to Dorothy
Then the shaggy man turned around and faced his enemies standing just outside the opening and as fast as they threw their heads at him he caught them and tossed them into the black gulf below
The headless bodies of the foremost Scoodlers kept the others from running close up but they also threw their heads in an effort to stop the escaping prisoners
The shaggy man caught them all and sent them whirling down into the black gulf
Among them he noticed the crimson and yellow head of the Queen and this he tossed after the others with right good will
Presently every Scoodler of the lot had thrown its head and every head was down in the deep gulf and now the helpless bodies of the creatures were mixed together in the cave and wriggling around in a vain attempt to discover what had become of their heads
The shaggy man laughed and walked across the bridge to rejoin his companions
Its lucky I learned to play baseball when I was young he remarked for I caught all those heads easily and never missed one
But come along little ones the Scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else any more
ButtonBright was still frightened and kept insisting I dont want to be soup
for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy could not realize they were free and safe
But the shaggy man assured him that all danger of their being made into soup was now past as the Scoodlers would be unable to eat soup for some time to come
So now anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as possible they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just beyond the place where they had first met the Scoodlers and you may be sure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again
11
Johnny Dooit Does It Its getting awful rough walking said Dorothy as they trudged along
ButtonBright gave a deep sigh and said he was hungry
Indeed all were hungry and thirsty too for they had eaten nothing but the apples since breakfast so their steps lagged and they grew silent and weary
At last they slowly passed over the crest of a barren hill and saw before them a line of green trees with a strip of grass at their feet
An agreeable fragrance was wafted toward them
Our travelers hot and tired ran forward on beholding this refreshing sight and were not long in coming to the trees
Here they found a spring of pure bubbling water around which the grass was full of wild strawberry plants their pretty red berries ripe and ready to eat
Some of the trees bore yellow oranges and some russet pears so the hungry adventurers suddenly found themselves provided with plenty to eat and to drink
They lost no time in picking the biggest strawberries and ripest oranges and soon had feasted to their hearts content
Walking beyond the line of trees they saw before them a fearful dismal desert everywhere gray sand
At the edge of this awful waste was a large white sign with black letters neatly painted upon it and the letters made these words ALL PERSONS ARE WARNED NOT TO VENTURE UPON THIS DESERT For the Deadly Sands will Turn Any Living Flesh to Dust in an instant
Beyond This Barrier is the LAND OF OZ But no one can Reach that Beautiful Country because of these Destroying Sands Oh said Dorothy when the shaggy man had read the sign aloud Ive seen this desert before and its true no one can live who tries to walk upon the sands
Then we musnt try it answered the shaggy man thoughtfully
But as we cant go ahead and theres no use going back what shall we do next
Dont know said ButtonBright
Im sure I dont know either added Dorothy despondently
I wish father would come for me sighed the pretty Rainbows Daughter I would take you all to live upon the rainbow where you could dance along its rays from morning till night without a care or worry of any sort
But I suppose fathers too busy just now to search the world for me
Dont want to dance said ButtonBright sitting down wearily upon the soft grass
Its very good of you Polly said Dorothy but there are other things that would suit me better than dancing on rainbows
Im fraid theyd be kind of soft an squashy under foot anyhow although theyre so pretty to look at
This didnt help to solve the problem and they all fell silent and looked at one another questioningly
Really I dont know what to do muttered the shaggy man gazing hard at Toto and the little dog wagged his tail and said Bowwow
just as if he could not tell either what to do
ButtonBright got a stick and began to dig in the earth and the others watched him for a while in deep thought
Finally the shaggy man said Its nearly evening now so we may as well sleep in this pretty place and get rested perhaps by morning we can decide what is best to be done
There was little chance to make beds for the children but the leaves of the trees grew thickly and would serve to keep off the night dews so the shaggy man piled soft grasses in the thickest shade and when it was dark they lay down and slept peacefully until morning
Long after the others were asleep however the shaggy man sat in the starlight by the spring gazing thoughtfully into its bubbling waters
Suddenly he smiled and nodded to himself as if he had found a good thought after which he too laid himself down under a tree and was soon lost in slumber
In the bright morning sunshine as they ate of the strawberries and sweet juicy pears Dorothy said Polly can you do any magic
No dear answered Polychrome shaking her dainty head
You ought to know SOME magic being the Rainbows Daughter continued Dorothy earnestly
But we who live on the rainbow among the fleecy clouds have no use for magic replied Polychrome
What Id like said Dorothy is to find some way to cross the desert to the Land of Oz and its Emerald City
Ive crossed it already you know more than once
First a cyclone carried my house over and some Silver Shoes brought me back againin half a second
Then Ozma took me over on her Magic Carpet and the Nome Kings Magic Belt took me home that time
You see it was magic that did it every time cept the first and we cant spect a cyclone to happen along and take us to the Emerald City now
No indeed returned Polly with a shudder I hate cyclones anyway
Thats why I wanted to find out if you could do any magic said the little Kansas girl
Im sure I cant and Im sure ButtonBright cant and the only magic the shaggy man has is the Love Magnet which wont help us much
Dont be too sure of that my dear spoke the shaggy man a smile on his donkey face
I may not be able to do magic myself but I can call to us a powerful friend who loves me because I own the Love Magnet and this friend surely will be able to help us
Who is your friend
asked Dorothy
Johnny Dooit
What can Johnny do
Anything answered the shaggy man with confidence
Ask him to come she exclaimed eagerly
The shaggy man took the Love Magnet from his pocket and unwrapped the paper that surrounded it
Holding the charm in the palm of his hand he looked at it steadily and said these words Dear Johnny Dooit come to me
I need you bad as bad can be
Well here I am said a cheery little voice but you shouldnt say you need me bad cause Im always ALWAYS good
At this they quickly whirled around to find a funny little man sitting on a big copper chest puffing smoke from a long pipe
His hair was grey his whiskers were grey and these whiskers were so long that he had wound the ends of them around his waist and tied them in a hard knot underneath the leather apron that reached from his chin nearly to his feet and which was soiled and scratched as if it had been used a long time
His nose was broad and stuck up a little but his eyes were twinkling and merry
The little mans hands and arms were as hard and tough as the leather in his apron and Dorothy thought Johnny Dooit looked as if he had done a lot of hard work in his lifetime
Good morning Johnny said the shaggy man
Thank you for coming to me so quickly
I never waste time said the newcomer promptly
But whats happened to you
Where did you get that donkey head
Really I wouldnt have known you at all Shaggy Man if I hadnt looked at your feet
The shaggy man introduced Johnny Dooit to Dorothy and Toto and ButtonBright and the Rainbows Daughter and told him the story of their adventures adding that they were anxious now to reach the Emerald City in the Land of Oz where Dorothy had friends who would take care of them and send them safe home again
But said he we find that we cant cross this desert which turns all living flesh that touches it into dust so I have asked you to come and help us
Johnny Dooit puffed his pipe and looked carefully at the dreadful desert in front of themstretching so far away they could not see its end
You must ride he said briskly
What in
asked the shaggy man
In a sandboat which has runners like a sled and sails like a ship
The wind will blow you swiftly across the desert and the sand cannot touch your flesh to turn it into dust
Good
cried Dorothy clapping her hands delightedly
That was the way the Magic Carpet took us across
We didnt have to touch the horrid sand at all
But where is the sandboat
asked the shaggy man looking all around him
Ill make you one said Johnny Dooit
As he spoke he knocked the ashes from his pipe and put it in his pocket
Then he unlocked the copper chest and lifted the lid and Dorothy saw it was full of shining tools of all sorts and shapes
Johnny Dooit moved quickly nowso quickly that they were astonished at the work he was able to accomplish
He had in his chest a tool for everything he wanted to do and these must have been magic tools because they did their work so fast and so well
The man hummed a little song as he worked and Dorothy tried to listen to it
She thought the words were something like these The only way to do a thing Is do it when you can And do it cheerfully and sing And work and think and plan
The only real unhappy one Is he who dares to shirk The only really happy one Is he who cares to work
Whatever Johnny Dooit was singing he was certainly doing things and they all stood by and watched him in amazement
He seized an axe and in a couple of chops felled a tree
Next he took a saw and in a few minutes sawed the treetrunk into broad long boards
He then nailed the boards together into the shape of a boat about twelve feet long and four feet wide
He cut from another tree a long slender pole which when trimmed of its branches and fastened upright in the center of the boat served as a mast
From the chest he drew a coil of rope and a big bundle of canvas and with thesestill humming his songhe rigged up a sail arranging it so it could be raised or lowered upon the mast
Dorothy fairly gasped with wonder to see the thing grow so speedily before her eyes and both ButtonBright and Polly looked on with the same absorbed interest
It ought to be painted said Johnny Dooit tossing his tools back into the chest for that would make it look prettier
But though I can paint it for you in three seconds it would take an hour to dry and thats a waste of time
We dont care how it looks said the shaggy man if only it will take us across the desert
It will do that declared Johnny Dooit
All you need worry about is tipping over
Did you ever sail a ship
Ive seen one sailed said the shaggy man
Good
Sail this boat the way youve seen a ship sailed and youll be across the sands before you know it
With this he slammed down the lid of the chest and the noise made them all wink
While they were winking the workman disappeared tools and all
12
The Deadly Desert Crossed Oh thats too bad
cried Dorothy I wanted to thank Johnny Dooit for all his kindness to us
He hasnt time to listen to thanks replied the shaggy man but Im sure he knows we are grateful
I suppose he is already at work in some other part of the world
They now looked more carefully at the sandboat and saw that the bottom was modeled with two sharp runners which would glide through the sand
The front of the sandboat was pointed like the bow of a ship and there was a rudder at the stern to steer by
It had been built just at the edge of the desert so that all its length lay upon the gray sand except the after part which still rested on the strip of grass
Get in my dears said the shaggy man Im sure I can manage this boat as well as any sailor
All you need do is sit still in your places
Dorothy got in Toto in her arms and sat on the bottom of the boat just in front of the mast
ButtonBright sat in front of Dorothy while Polly leaned over the bow
The shaggy man knelt behind the mast
When all were ready he raised the sail halfway
The wind caught it
At once the sandboat started forwardslowly at first then with added speed
The shaggy man pulled the sail way up and they flew so fast over the Deadly Desert that every one held fast to the sides of the boat and scarcely dared to breathe
The sand lay in billows and was in places very uneven so that the boat rocked dangerously from side to side but it never quite tipped over and the speed was so great that the shaggy man himself became frightened and began to wonder how he could make the ship go slower
It were spilled in this sand in the middle of the desert Dorothy thought to herself well be nothing but dust in a few minutes and that will be the end of us
But they were not spilled and byandby Polychrome who was clinging to the bow and looking straight ahead saw a dark line before them and wondered what it was
It grew plainer every second until she discovered it to be a row of jagged rocks at the end of the desert while high above these rocks she could see a tableland of green grass and beautiful trees
Look out
she screamed to the shaggy man
Go slowly or we shall smash into the rocks
He heard her and tried to pull down the sail but the wind would not let go of the broad canvas and the ropes had become tangled
Nearer and nearer they drew to the great rocks and the shaggy man was in despair because he could do nothing to stop the wild rush of the sandboat
They reached the edge of the desert and bumped squarely into the rocks
There was a crash as Dorothy ButtonBright Toto and Polly flew up in the air in a curve like a skyrockets one after another landing high upon the grass where they rolled and tumbled for a time before they could stop themselves
The shaggy man flew after them head first and lighted in a heap beside Toto who being much excited at the time seized one of the donkey ears between his teeth and shook and worried it as hard as he could growling angrily
The shaggy man made the little dog let go and sat up to look around him
Dorothy was feeling one of her front teeth which was loosened by knocking against her knee as she fell
Polly was looking sorrowfully at a rent in her pretty gauze gown and ButtonBrights fox head had stuck fast in a gopher hole and he was wiggling his little fat legs frantically in an effort to get free
Otherwise they were unhurt by the adventure so the shaggy man stood up and pulled ButtonBright out of the hole and went to the edge of the desert to look at the sandboat
It was a mere mass of splinters now crushed out of shape against the rocks
The wind had torn away the sail and carried it to the top of a tall tree where the fragments of it fluttered like a white flag
Well he said cheerfully were here but where the here is I dont know
It must be some part of the Land of Oz observed Dorothy coming to his side
Must it
Course it must
Were across the desert arent we
And somewhere in the middle of Oz is the Emerald City
To be sure said the shaggy man nodding
Lets go there
But I dont see any people about to show us the way she continued
Lets hunt for them he suggested
There must be people somewhere but perhaps they did not expect us and so are not at hand to give us a welcome
13
The Truth Pond They now made a more careful examination of the country around them
All was fresh and beautiful after the sultriness of the desert and the sunshine and sweet crisp air were delightful to the wanderers
Little mounds of yellowish green were away at the right while on the left waved a group of tall leafy trees bearing yellow blossoms that looked like tassels and pompoms
Among the grasses carpeting the ground were pretty buttercups and cowslips and marigolds
After looking at these a moment Dorothy said reflectively We must be in the Country of the Winkies for the color of that country is yellow and you will notice that most everything here is yellow that has any color at all
But I thought this was the Land of Oz replied the shaggy man as if greatly disappointed
So it is she declared but there are four parts to the Land of Oz
The North Country is purple and its the Country of the Gillikins
The East Country is blue and thats the Country of the Munchkins
Down at the South is the red Country of the Quadlings and here in the West the yellow Country of the Winkies
This is the part that is ruled by the Tin Woodman you know
Whos he
asked ButtonBright
Why hes the tin man I told you about
His name is Nick Chopper and he has a lovely heart given him by the wonderful Wizard
Where does HE live
asked the boy
The Wizard
Oh he lives in the Emerald City which is just in the middle of Oz where the corners of the four countries meet
Oh said ButtonBright puzzled by this explanation
We must be some distance from the Emerald City remarked the shaggy man
Thats true she replied so wed better start on and see if we can find any of the Winkies
Theyre nice people she continued as the little party began walking toward the group of trees and I came here once with my friends the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion to fight a wicked witch who had made all the Winkies her slaves
Did you conquer her
asked Polly
Why I melted her with a bucket of water and that was the end of her replied Dorothy
After that the people were free you know and they made Nick Chopperthats the Tin Woodmantheir Empror
Whats that
asked ButtonBright
Empror
Oh its something like an alderman I guess
Oh said the boy
But I thought Princess Ozma ruled Oz said the shaggy man
So she does she rules the Emerald City and all the four countries of Oz but each country has another little ruler not so big as Ozma
Its like the officers of an army you see the little rulers are all captains and Ozmas the general
By this time they had reached the trees which stood in a perfect circle and just far enough apart so that their thick branches touchedor shook hands as ButtonBright remarked
Under the shade of the trees they found in the center of the circle a crystal pool its water as still as glass
It must have been deep too for when Polychrome bent over it she gave a little sigh of pleasure
Why its a mirror
she cried for she could see all her pretty face and fluffy rainbowtinted gown reflected in the pool as natural as life
Dorothy bent over too and began to arrange her hair blown by the desert wind into straggling tangles
ButtonBright leaned over the edge next and then began to cry for the sight of his fox head frightened the poor little fellow
I guess I wont look remarked the shaggy man sadly for he didnt like his donkey head either
While Polly and Dorothy tried to comfort ButtonBright the shaggy man sat down near the edge of the pool where his image could not be reflected and stared at the water thoughtfully
As he did this he noticed a silver plate fastened to a rock just under the surface of the water and on the silver plate was engraved these words THE TRUTH POND Ah
cried the shaggy man springing to his feet with eager joy weve found it at last
Found what
asked Dorothy running to him
The Truth Pond
Now at last I may get rid of this frightful head for we were told you remember that only the Truth Pond could restore to me my proper face
Me too
shouted ButtonBright trotting up to them
Of course said Dorothy
It will cure you both of your bad heads I guess
Isnt it lucky we found it
It is indeed replied the shaggy man
I hated dreadfully to go to Princess Ozma looking like this and shes to have a birthday celebration too
Just then a splash startled them for ButtonBright in his anxiety to see the pool that would cure him had stepped too near the edge and tumbled heels over head into the water
Down he went out of sight entirely so that only his sailor hat floated on the top of the Truth Pond
He soon bobbed up and the shaggy man seized him by his sailor collar and dragged him to the shore dripping and gasping for breath
They all looked upon the boy wonderingly for the fox head with its sharp nose and pointed ears was gone and in its place appeared the chubby round face and blue eyes and pretty curls that had belonged to ButtonBright before King Dox of Foxville transformed him
Oh what a darling
cried Polly and would have hugged the little one had he not been so wet
Their joyful exclamations made the child rub the water out of his eyes and look at his friends questioningly
Youre all right now dear said Dorothy
Come and look at yourself
She led him to the pool and although there were still a few ripples on the surface of the water he could see his reflection plainly
Its me
he said in a pleased yet awed whisper
Course it is replied the girl and were all as glad as you are ButtonBright
Well announced the shaggy man its my turn next
He took off his shaggy coat and laid it on the grass and dived head first into the Truth Pond
When he came up the donkey head had disappeared and the shaggy mans own shaggy head was in its place with the water dripping in little streams from his shaggy whiskers
He scrambled ashore and shook himself to get off some of the wet and then leaned over the pool to look admiringly at his reflected face
I may not be strictly beautiful even now he said to his companions who watched him with smiling faces but Im so much handsomer than any donkey that I feel as proud as I can be
Youre all right Shaggy Man declared Dorothy
And ButtonBright is all right too
So lets thank the Truth Pond for being so nice and start on our journey to the Emerald City
I hate to leave it murmured the shaggy man with a sigh
A truth pond wouldnt be a bad thing to carry around with us
But he put on his coat and started with the others in search of some one to direct them on their way
14
TikTok and Billina They had not walked far across the flowerstrewn meadows when they came upon a fine road leading toward the northwest and winding gracefully among the pretty yellow hills
That way said Dorothy must be the direction of the Emerald City
Wed better follow the road until we meet some one or come to a house
The sun soon dried ButtonBrights sailor suit and the shaggy mans shaggy clothes and so pleased were they at regaining their own heads that they did not mind at all the brief discomfort of getting wet
Its good to be able to whistle again remarked the shaggy man for those donkey lips were so thick I could not whistle a note with them
He warbled a tune as merrily as any bird
Youll look more natural at the birthday celebration too said Dorothy happy in seeing her friends so happy
Polychrome was dancing ahead in her usual sprightly manner whirling gaily along the smooth level road until she passed from sight around the curve of one of the mounds
Suddenly they heard her exclaim Oh
and she appeared again running toward them at full speed
Whats the matter Polly
asked Dorothy perplexed
There was no need for the Rainbows Daughter to answer for turning the bend in the road there came advancing slowly toward them a funny round man made of burnished copper gleaming brightly in the sun
Perched on the copper mans shoulder sat a yellow hen with fluffy feathers and a pearl necklace around her throat
Oh Tiktok
cried Dorothy running forward
When she came to him the copper man lifted the little girl in his copper arms and kissed her cheek with his copper lips
Oh Billina
cried Dorothy in a glad voice and the yellow hen flew to her arms to be hugged and petted by turns
The others were curiously crowding around the group and the girl said to them Its Tiktok and Billina and oh
Im so glad to see them again
Welcome to Oz said the copper man in a monotonous voice
Dorothy sat right down in the road the yellow hen in her arms and began to stroke Billinas back
Said the hen Dorothy dear Ive got some wonderful news to tell you
Tell it quick Billina
said the girl
Just then Toto who had been growling to himself in a cross way gave a sharp bark and flew at the yellow hen who ruffled her feathers and let out such an angry screech that Dorothy was startled
Stop Toto
Stop that this minute
she commanded
Cant you see that Billina is my friend
In spite of this warning had she not grabbed Toto quickly by the neck the little dog would have done the yellow hen a mischief and even now he struggled madly to escape Dorothys grasp
She slapped his ears once or twice and told him to behave and the yellow hen flew to Tiktoks shoulder again where she was safe
What a brute
croaked Billina glaring down at the little dog
Toto isnt a brute replied Dorothy but at home Uncle Henry has to whip him sometimes for chasing the chickens
Now look here Toto she added holding up her finger and speaking sternly to him youve got to understand that Billina is one of my dearest friends and musnt be hurtnow or ever
Toto wagged his tail as if he understood
The miserable thing cant talk said Billina with a sneer
Yes he can replied Dorothy he talks with his tail and I know everything he says
If you could wag your tail Billina you wouldnt need words to talk with
Nonsense
said Billina
It isnt nonsense at all
Just now Toto says hes sorry and that hell try to love you for my sake
Dont you Toto
Bowwow
said Toto wagging his tail again
But Ive such wonderful news for you Dorothy cried the yellow hen Ive Wait a minute dear interrupted the little girl Ive got to introduce you all first
Thats manners Billina
This turning to her traveling companions is Mr Tiktok who works by machinery cause his thoughts wind up and his talk winds up and his action winds uplike a clock
Do they all wind up together
asked the shaggy man
No each one separate
But he works just lovely and Tiktok was a good friend to me once and saved my lifeand Billinas life too
Is he alive
asked ButtonBright looking hard at the copper man
Oh no but his machinery makes him just as good as alive
She turned to the copper man and said politely Mr Tiktok these are my new friends the shaggy man and Polly the Rainbows Daughter and ButtonBright and Toto
Only Toto isnt a new friend cause hes been to Oz before
The copper man bowed low removing his copper hat as he did so
Im very pleased to meet Dorothys frrrr Here he stopped short
Oh I guess his speech needs winding
said the little girl running behind the copper man to get the key off a hook at his back
She wound him up at a place under his right arm and he went on to say Pardon me for running down
I was about to say I am pleased to meet Dorothys friends who must be my friends
The words were somewhat jerky but plain to understand
And this is Billina continued Dorothy introducing the yellow hen and they all bowed to her in turn
Ive such wonderful news said the hen turning her head so that one bright eye looked full at Dorothy
What is it dear
asked the girl
Ive hatched out ten of the loveliest chicks you ever saw
Oh how nice
And where are they Billina
I left them at home
But theyre beauties I assure you and all wonderfully clever
Ive named them Dorothy
Which one
asked the girl
All of them replied Billina
Thats funny
Why did you name them all with the same name
It was so hard to tell them apart explained the hen
Now when I call Dorothy they all come running to me in a bunch its much easier after all than having a separate name for each
Im just dying to see em Billina said Dorothy eagerly
But tell me my friends how did you happen to be here in the Country of the Winkies the first of all to meet us
Ill tell you answered Tiktok in his monotonous voice all the sounds of his words being on one levelPrincess Ozma saw you in her magic picture and knew you were coming here so she sent Billina and me to welcome you as she could not come herself so thatfizidigle cumsoluting hybergobble intuzibick Good gracious
Whatevers the matter now
cried Dorothy as the copper man continued to babble these unmeaning words which no one could understand at all because they had no sense
Dont know said ButtonBright who was half scared
Polly whirled away to a distance and turned to look at the copper man in a fright
His thoughts have run down this time remarked Billina composedly as she sat on Tiktoks shoulder and pruned her sleek feathers
When he cant think he cant talk properly any more than you can
Youll have to wind up his thoughts Dorothy or else Ill have to finish his story myself
Dorothy ran around and got the key again and wound up Tiktok under his left arm after which he could speak plainly again
Pardon me he said but when my thoughts run down my speech has no meaning for words are formed only by thought
I was about to say that Ozma sent us to welcome you and invite you to come straight to the Emerald City
She was too busy to come herself for she is preparing for her birthday celebration which is to be a grand affair
Ive heard of it said Dorothy and Im glad weve come in time to attend
Is it far from here to the Emerald City
Not very far answered Tiktok and we have plenty of time
Tonight we will stop at the palace of the Tin Woodman and tomorrow night we will arrive at the Emerald City
Goody
cried Dorothy
Id like to see dear Nick Chopper again
Hows his heart
Its fine said Billina the Tin Woodman says it gets softer and kindlier every day
Hes waiting at his castle to welcome you Dorothy but he couldnt come with us because hes getting polished as bright as possible for Ozmas party
Well then said Dorothy lets start on and we can talk more as we go
They proceeded on their journey in a friendly group for Polychrome had discovered that the copper man was harmless and was no longer afraid of him
ButtonBright was also reassured and took quite a fancy to Tiktok
He wanted the clockwork man to open himself so that he might see the wheels go round but that was a thing Tiktok could not do
ButtonBright then wanted to wind up the copper man and Dorothy promised he should do so as soon as any part of the machinery ran down
This pleased ButtonBright who held fast to one of Tiktoks copper hands as he trudged along the road while Dorothy walked on the other side of her old friend and Billina perched by turns upon his shoulder or his copper hat
Polly once more joyously danced ahead and Toto ran after her barking with glee
The shaggy man was left to walk behind but he didnt seem to mind that a bitand whistled merrily or looked curiously upon the pretty scenes they passed
At last they came to a hilltop from which the tin castle of Nick Chopper could plainly be seen its towers glistening magnificently under the rays of the declining sun
How pretty
exclaimed Dorothy
Ive never seen the Emprors new house before
He built it because the old castle was damp and likely to rust his tin body said Billina
All those towers and steeples and domes and gables took a lot of tin as you can see
Is it a toy
asked ButtonBright softly
No dear answered Dorothy its better than that
Its the fairy dwelling of a fairy prince
15
The Emperors Tin Castle The grounds around Nick Choppers new house were laid out in pretty flowerbeds with fountains of crystal water and statues of tin representing the Emperors personal friends
Dorothy was astonished and delighted to find a tin statue of herself standing on a tin pedestal at a bend in the avenue leading up to the entrance
It was lifesize and showed her in her sunbonnet with her basket on her arm just as she had first appeared in the Land of Oz
Oh Totoyoure there too
she exclaimed and sure enough there was the tin figure of Toto lying at the tin Dorothys feet
Also Dorothy saw figures of the Scarecrow and the Wizard and Ozma and of many others including Tiktok
They reached the grand tin entrance to the tin castle and the Tin Woodman himself came running out of the door to embrace little Dorothy and give her a glad welcome
He welcomed her friends as well and the Rainbows Daughter he declared to be the loveliest vision his tin eyes had ever beheld
He patted ButtonBrights curly head tenderly for he was fond of children and turned to the shaggy man and shook both his hands at the same time
Nick Chopper the Emperor of the Winkies who was also known throughout the Land of Oz as the Tin Woodman was certainly a remarkable person
He was neatly made all of tin nicely soldered at the joints and his various limbs were cleverly hinged to his body so that he could use them nearly as well as if they had been common flesh
Once he told the shaggy man he had been made all of flesh and bones as other people are and then he chopped wood in the forests to earn his living
But the axe slipped so often and cut off parts of himwhich he had replaced with tinthat finally there was no flesh left nothing but tin so he became a real tin woodman
The wonderful Wizard of Oz had given him an excellent heart to replace his old one and he didnt at all mind being tin
Every one loved him he loved every one and he was therefore as happy as the day was long
The Emperor was proud of his new tin castle and showed his visitors through all the rooms
Every bit of the furniture was made of brightly polished tinthe tables chairs beds and alleven the floors and walls were of tin
I suppose said he that there are no cleverer tinsmiths in all the world than the Winkies
It would be hard to match this castle in Kansas wouldnt it little Dorothy
Very hard replied the child gravely
It must have cost a lot of money remarked the shaggy man
Money
Money in Oz
cried the Tin Woodman
What a queer idea
Did you suppose we are so vulgar as to use money here
Why not
asked the shaggy man
If we used money to buy things with instead of love and kindness and the desire to please one another then we should be no better than the rest of the world declared the Tin Woodman
Fortunately money is not known in the Land of Oz at all
We have no rich and no poor for what one wishes the others all try to give him in order to make him happy and no one in all Oz cares to have more than he can use
Good
cried the shaggy man greatly pleased to hear this
I also despise moneya man in Butterfield owes me fifteen cents and I will not take it from him
The Land of Oz is surely the most favored land in all the world and its people the happiest
I should like to live here always
The Tin Woodman listened with respectful attention
Already he loved the shaggy man although he did not yet know of the Love Magnet
So he said If you can prove to the Princess Ozma that you are honest and true and worthy of our friendship you may indeed live here all your days and be as happy as we are
Ill try to prove that said the shaggy man earnestly
And now continued the Emperor you must all go to your rooms and prepare for dinner which will presently be served in the grand tin dininghall
I am sorry Shaggy Man that I can not offer you a change of clothing but I dress only in tin myself and I suppose that would not suit you
I care little about dress said the shaggy man indifferently
So I should imagine replied the Emperor with true politeness
They were shown to their rooms and permitted to make such toilets as they could and soon they assembled again in the grand tin dininghall even Toto being present
For the Emperor was fond of Dorothys little dog and the girl explained to her friends that in Oz all animals were treated with as much consideration as the peopleif they behave themselves she added
Toto behaved himself and sat in a tin highchair beside Dorothy and ate his dinner from a tin platter
Indeed they all ate from tin dishes but these were of pretty shapes and brightly polished Dorothy thought they were just as good as silver
ButtonBright looked curiously at the man who had no appetite inside him for the Tin Woodman although he had prepared so fine a feast for his guests ate not a mouthful himself sitting patiently in his place to see that all built so they could eat were well and plentifully served
What pleased ButtonBright most about the dinner was the tin orchestra that played sweet music while the company ate
The players were not tin being just ordinary Winkies but the instruments they played upon were all tintin trumpets tin fiddles tin drums and cymbals and flutes and horns and all
They played so nicely the Shining Emperor Waltz composed expressly in honor of the Tin Woodman by Mr H M Wogglebug TE that Polly could not resist dancing to it
After she had tasted a few dewdrops freshly gathered for her she danced gracefully to the music while the others finished their repast and when she whirled until her fleecy draperies of rainbow hues enveloped her like a cloud the Tin Woodman was so delighted that he clapped his tin hands until the noise of them drowned the sound of the cymbals
Altogether it was a merry meal although Polychrome ate little and the host nothing at all
Im sorry the Rainbows Daughter missed her mistcakes said the Tin Woodman to Dorothy but by a mistake Miss Pollys mistcakes were mislaid and not missed until now
Ill try to have some for her breakfast
They spent the evening telling stories and the next morning left the splendid tin castle and set out upon the road to the Emerald City
The Tin Woodman went with them of course having by this time been so brightly polished that he sparkled like silver
His axe which he always carried with him had a steel blade that was tin plated and a handle covered with tin plate beautifully engraved and set with diamonds
The Winkies assembled before the castle gates and cheered their Emperor as he marched away and it was easy to see that they all loved him dearly
16
Visiting the PumpkinField Dorothy let ButtonBright wind up the clockwork in the copper man this morninghis thinking machine first then his speech and finally his action so he would doubtless run perfectly until they had reached the Emerald City
The copper man and the tin man were good friends and not so much alike as you might think
For one was alive and the other moved by means of machinery one was tall and angular and the other short and round
You could love the Tin Woodman because he had a fine nature kindly and simple but the machine man you could only admire without loving since to love such a thing as he was as impossible as to love a sewingmachine or an automobile
Yet Tiktok was popular with the people of Oz because he was so trustworthy reliable and true he was sure to do exactly what he was wound up to do at all times and in all circumstances
Perhaps it is better to be a machine that does its duty than a fleshandblood person who will not for a dead truth is better than a live falsehood
About noon the travelers reached a large field of pumpkinsa vegetable quite appropriate to the yellow country of the Winkiesand some of the pumpkins which grew there were of remarkable size
Just before they entered upon this field they saw three little mounds that looked like graves with a pretty headstone to each one of them
What is this
asked Dorothy in wonder
Its Jack Pumpkinheads private graveyard replied the Tin Woodman
But I thought nobody ever died in Oz she said
Nor do they although if one is bad he may be condemned and killed by the good citizens he answered
Dorothy ran over to the little graves and read the words engraved upon the tombstones
The first one said Here Lies the Mortal Part of JACK PUMPKINHEAD Which Spoiled April 9th
She then went to the next stone which read Here Lies the Mortal Part of JACK PUMPKINHEAD Which Spoiled October 2nd
On the third stone were carved these words Here Lies the Mortal Part of JACK PUMPKINHEAD Which Spoiled January 24th
Poor Jack
sighed Dorothy
Im sorry he had to die in three parts for I hoped to see him again
So you shall declared the Tin Woodman since he is still alive
Come with me to his house for Jack is now a farmer and lives in this very pumpkin field
They walked over to a monstrous big hollow pumpkin which had a door and windows cut through the rind
There was a stovepipe running through the stem and six steps had been built leading up to the front door
They walked up to this door and looked in
Seated on a bench was a man clothed in a spotted shirt a red vest and faded blue trousers whose body was merely sticks of wood jointed clumsily together
On his neck was set a round yellow pumpkin with a face carved on it such as a boy often carves on a jacklantern
This queer man was engaged in snapping slippery pumpkinseeds with his wooden fingers trying to hit a target on the other side of the room with them
He did not know he had visitors until Dorothy exclaimed Why its Jack Pumpkinhead himself
He turned and saw them and at once came forward to greet the little Kansas girl and Nick Chopper and to be introduced to their new friends
ButtonBright was at first rather shy with the quaint Pumpkinhead but Jacks face was so jolly and smilingbeing carved that waythat the boy soon grew to like him
I thought a while ago that you were buried in three parts said Dorothy but now I see youre just the same as ever
Not quite the same my dear for my mouth is a little more onesided than it used to be but pretty nearly the same
Ive a new head and this is the fourth one Ive owned since Ozma first made me and brought me to life by sprinkling me with the Magic Powder
What became of the other heads Jack
They spoiled and I buried them for they were not even fit for pies
Each time Ozma has carved me a new head just like the old one and as my body is by far the largest part of me I am still Jack Pumpkinhead no matter how often I change my upper end
Once we had a dreadful time to find another pumpkin as they were out of season and so I was obliged to wear my old head a little longer than was strictly healthy
But after this sad experience I resolved to raise pumpkins myself so as never to be caught again without one handy and now I have this fine field that you see before you
Some grow pretty bigtoo big to be used for headsso I dug out this one and use it for a house
Isnt it damp
asked Dorothy
Not very
There isnt much left but the shell you see and it will last a long time yet
I think you are brighter than you used to be Jack said the Tin Woodman
Your last head was a stupid one
The seeds in this one are better was the reply
Are you going to Ozmas party
asked Dorothy
Yes said he I wouldnt miss it for anything
Ozmas my parent you know because she built my body and carved my pumpkin head
Ill follow you to the Emerald City tomorrow where we shall meet again
I cant go today because I have to plant fresh pumpkinseeds and water the young vines
But give my love to Ozma and tell her Ill be there in time for the jubilation
We will she promised and then they all left him and resumed their journey
17
The Royal Chariot Arrives The neat yellow houses of the Winkies were now to be seen standing here and there along the roadway giving the country a more cheerful and civilized look
They were farmhouses though and set far apart for in the Land of Oz there were no towns or villages except the magnificent Emerald City in its center
Hedges of evergreen or of yellow roses bordered the broad highway and the farms showed the care of their industrious inhabitants
The nearer the travelers came to the great city the more prosperous the country became and they crossed many bridges over the sparkling streams and rivulets that watered the lands
As they walked leisurely along the shaggy man said to the Tin Woodman What sort of a Magic Powder was it that made your friend the Pumpkinhead live
It was called the Powder of Life was the answer and it was invented by a crooked Sorcerer who lived in the mountains of the North Country
A Witch named Mombi got some of this powder from the crooked Sorcerer and took it home with her
Ozma lived with the Witch then for it was before she became our Princess while Mombi had transformed her into the shape of a boy
Well while Mombi was gone to the crooked Sorcerers the boy made this pumpkinheaded man to amuse himself and also with the hope of frightening the Witch with it when she returned
But Mombi was not scared and she sprinkled the Pumpkinhead with her Magic Powder of Life to see if the Powder would work
Ozma was watching and saw the Pumpkinhead come to life so that night she took the pepperbox containing the Powder and ran away with it and with Jack in search of adventures
Next day they found a wooden SawHorse standing by the roadside and sprinkled it with the Powder
It came to life at once and Jack Pumpkinhead rode the SawHorse to the Emerald City
What became of the SawHorse afterward
asked the shaggy man much interested in this story
Oh its alive yet and you will probably meet it presently in the Emerald City
Afterward Ozma used the last of the Powder to bring the Flying Gump to life but as soon as it had carried her away from her enemies the Gump was taken apart so it doesnt exist any more
Its too bad the Powder of Life was all used up remarked the shaggy man it would be a handy thing to have around
I am not so sure of that sir answered the Tin Woodman
A while ago the crooked Sorcerer who invented the Magic Powder fell down a precipice and was killed
All his possessions went to a relativean old woman named Dyna who lives in the Emerald City
She went to the mountains where the Sorcerer had lived and brought away everything she thought of value
Among them was a small bottle of the Powder of Life but of course Dyna didnt know it was a Magic Powder at all
It happened she had once had a big blue bear for a pet but the bear choked to death on a fishbone one day and she loved it so dearly that Dyna made a rug of its skin leaving the head and four paws on the hide
She kept the rug on the floor of her front parlor
Ive seen rugs like that said the shaggy man nodding but never one made from a blue bear
Well continued the Tin Woodman the old woman had an idea that the Powder in the bottle must be mothpowder because it smelled something like mothpowder so one day she sprinkled it on her bear rug to keep the moths out of it
She said looking lovingly at the skin I wish my dear bear were alive again
To her horror the bear rug at once came to life having been sprinkled with the Magic Powder and now this live bear rug is a great trial to her and makes her a lot of trouble
Why
asked the shaggy man
Well it stands up on its four feet and walks all around and gets in the way and that spoils it for a rug
It cant speak although it is alive for while its head might say words it has no breath in a solid body to push the words out of its mouth
Its a very slimpsy affair altogether that bear rug and the old woman is sorry it came to life
Every day she has to scold it and make it lie down flat on the parlor floor to be walked upon but sometimes when she goes to market the rug will hump up its back skin and stand on its four feet and trot along after her
I should think Dyna would like that said Dorothy
Well she doesnt because every one knows it isnt a real bear but just a hollow skin and so of no actual use in the world except for a rug answered the Tin Woodman
Therefore I believe it is a good thing that all the Magic Powder of Life is now used up as it can not cause any more trouble
Perhaps youre right said the shaggy man thoughtfully
At noon they stopped at a farmhouse where it delighted the farmer and his wife to be able to give them a good luncheon
The farm people knew Dorothy having seen her when she was in the country before and they treated the little girl with as much respect as they did the Emperor because she was a friend of the powerful Princess Ozma
They had not proceeded far after leaving this farmhouse before coming to a high bridge over a broad river
This river the Tin Woodman informed them was the boundary between the Country of the Winkies and the territory of the Emerald City
The city itself was still a long way off but all around it was a green meadow as pretty as a wellkept lawn and in this were neither houses nor farms to spoil the beauty of the scene
From the top of the high bridge they could see far away the magnificent spires and splendid domes of the superb city sparkling like brilliant jewels as they towered above the emerald walls
The shaggy man drew a deep breath of awe and amazement for never had he dreamed that such a grand and beautiful place could existeven in the fairyland of Oz
Polly was so pleased that her violet eyes sparkled like amethysts and she danced away from her companions across the bridge and into a group of feathery trees lining both the roadsides
These trees she stopped to look at with pleasure and surprise for their leaves were shaped like ostrich plumes their feather edges beautifully curled and all the plumes were tinted in the same dainty rainbow hues that appeared in Polychromes own pretty gauze gown
Father ought to see these trees she murmured they are almost as lovely as his own rainbows
Then she gave a start of terror for beneath the trees came stalking two great beasts either one big enough to crush the little Daughter of the Rainbow with one blow of his paws or to eat her up with one snap of his enormous jaws
One was a tawny lion as tall as a horse nearly the other a striped tiger almost the same size
Polly was too frightened to scream or to stir she stood still with a wildly beating heart until Dorothy rushed past her and with a glad cry threw her arms around the huge lions neck hugging and kissing the beast with evident joy
Oh Im SO glad to see you again
cried the little Kansas girl
And the Hungry Tiger too
How fine youre both looking
Are you well and happy
We certainly are Dorothy answered the Lion in a deep voice that sounded pleasant and kind and we are greatly pleased that you have come to Ozmas party
Its going to be a grand affair I promise you
There will be lots of fat babies at the celebration I hear remarked the Hungry Tiger yawning so that his mouth opened dreadfully wide and showed all his big sharp teeth but of course I cant eat any of em
Is your Conscience still in good order
asked Dorothy anxiously
Yes it rules me like a tyrant answered the Tiger sorrowfully
I can imagine nothing more unpleasant than to own a Conscience and he winked slyly at his friend the Lion
Youre fooling me
said Dorothy with a laugh
I dont blieve youd eat a baby if you lost your Conscience
Come here Polly she called and be introduced to my friends
Polly advanced rather shyly
You have some queer friends Dorothy she said
The queerness doesnt matter so long as theyre friends was the answer
This is the Cowardly Lion who isnt a coward at all but just thinks he is
The Wizard gave him some courage once and he has part of it left
The Lion bowed with great dignity to Polly
You are very lovely my dear said he
I hope we shall be friends when we are better acquainted
And this is the Hungry Tiger continued Dorothy
He says he longs to eat fat babies but the truth is he is never hungry at all cause he gets plenty to eat and I dont spose hed hurt anybody even if he WAS hungry
Hush Dorothy whispered the Tiger youll ruin my reputation if you are not more discreet
It isnt what we are but what folks think we are that counts in this world
And come to think of it Miss Polly would make a fine variegated breakfast Im sure
18
The Emerald City The others now came up and the Tin Woodman greeted the Lion and the Tiger cordially
ButtonBright yelled with fear when Dorothy first took his hand and led him toward the great beasts but the girl insisted they were kind and good and so the boy mustered up courage enough to pat their heads after they had spoken to him gently and he had looked into their intelligent eyes his fear vanished entirely and he was so delighted with the animals that he wanted to keep close to them and stroke their soft fur every minute
As for the shaggy man he might have been afraid if he had met the beasts alone or in any other country but so many were the marvels in the Land of Oz that he was no longer easily surprised and Dorothys friendship for the Lion and Tiger was enough to assure him they were safe companions
Toto barked at the Cowardly Lion in joyous greeting for he knew the beast of old and loved him and it was funny to see how gently the Lion raised his huge paw to pat Totos head
The little dog smelled of the Tigers nose and the Tiger politely shook paws with him so they were quite likely to become firm friends
Tiktok and Billina knew the beasts well so merely bade them good day and asked after their healths and inquired about the Princess Ozma
Now it was seen that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were drawing behind them a splendid golden chariot to which they were harnessed by golden cords
The body of the chariot was decorated on the outside with designs in clusters of sparkling emeralds while inside it was lined with a green and gold satin and the cushions of the seats were of green plush embroidered in gold with a crown underneath which was a monogram
Why its Ozmas own royal chariot
exclaimed Dorothy
Yes said the Cowardly Lion Ozma sent us to meet you here for she feared you would be weary with your long walk and she wished you to enter the City in a style becoming your exalted rank
What
cried Polly looking at Dorothy curiously
Do you belong to the nobility
Just in Oz I do said the child cause Ozma made me a Princess you know
But when Im home in Kansas Im only a country girl and have to help with the churning and wipe the dishes while Aunt Em washes em
Do you have to help wash dishes on the rainbow Polly
No dear answered Polychrome smiling
Well I dont have to work any in Oz either said Dorothy
Its kind of fun to be a Princess once in a while dont you think so
Dorothy and Polychrome and ButtonBright are all to ride in the chariot said the Lion
So get in my dears and be careful not to mar the gold or put your dusty feet on the embroidery
ButtonBright was delighted to ride behind such a superb team and he told Dorothy it made him feel like an actor in a circus
As the strides of the animals brought them nearer to the Emerald City every one bowed respectfully to the children as well as to the Tin Woodman Tiktok and the shaggy man who were following behind
The Yellow Hen had perched upon the back of the chariot where she could tell Dorothy more about her wonderful chickens as they rode
And so the grand chariot came finally to the high wall surrounding the City and paused before the magnificent jewelstudded gates
These were opened by a cheerfullooking little man who wore green spectacles over his eyes
Dorothy introduced him to her friends as the Guardian of the Gates and they noticed a big bunch of keys suspended on the golden chain that hung around his neck
The chariot passed through the outer gates into a fine arched chamber built in the thick wall and through the inner gates into the streets of the Emerald City
Polychrome exclaimed in rapture at the wondrous beauty that met her eyes on every side as they rode through this stately and imposing City the equal of which has never been discovered even in Fairyland
ButtonBright could only say My
so amazing was the sight but his eyes were wide open and he tried to look in every direction at the same time so as not to miss anything
The shaggy man was fairly astounded at what he saw for the graceful and handsome buildings were covered with plates of gold and set with emeralds so splendid and valuable that in any other part of the world any one of them would have been worth a fortune to its owner
The sidewalks were superb marble slabs polished as smooth as glass and the curbs that separated the walks from the broad street were also set thick with clustered emeralds
There were many people on these walksmen women and childrenall dressed in handsome garments of silk or satin or velvet with beautiful jewels
Better even than this all seemed happy and contented for their faces were smiling and free from care and music and laughter might be heard on every side
Dont they work at all
asked the shaggy man
To be sure they work replied the Tin Woodman this fair city could not be built or cared for without labor nor could the fruit and vegetables and other food be provided for the inhabitants to eat
But no one works more than half his time and the people of Oz enjoy their labors as much as they do their play
Its wonderful
declared the shaggy man
I do hope Ozma will let me live here
The chariot winding through many charming streets paused before a building so vast and noble and elegant that even ButtonBright guessed at once that it was the Royal Palace
Its gardens and ample grounds were surrounded by a separate wall not so high or thick as the wall around the City but more daintily designed and built all of green marble
The gates flew open as the chariot appeared before them and the Cowardly Lion and Hungry Tiger trotted up a jeweled driveway to the front door of the palace and stopped short
Here we are
said Dorothy gaily and helped ButtonBright from the chariot
Polychrome leaped out lightly after them and they were greeted by a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants who bowed low as the visitors mounted the marble steps
At their head was a pretty little maid with dark hair and eyes dressed all in green embroidered with silver
Dorothy ran up to her with evident pleasure and exclaimed O Jellia Jamb
Im so glad to see you again
Wheres Ozma
In her room your Highness replied the little maid demurely for this was Ozmas favorite attendant
She wishes you to come to her as soon as you have rested and changed your dress Princess Dorothy
And you and your friends are to dine with her this evening
When is her birthday Jellia
asked the girl
Day after tomorrow your Highness
And wheres the Scarecrow
Hes gone into the Munchkin country to get some fresh straw to stuff himself with in honor of Ozmas celebration replied the maid
He returns to the Emerald City tomorrow he said
By this time Toktok the Tin Woodman and the shaggy man had arrived and the chariot had gone around to the back of the palace Billina going with the Lion and Tiger to see her chickens after her absence from them
But Toto stayed close beside Dorothy
Come in please said Jellia Jamb it shall be our pleasant duty to escort all of you to the rooms prepared for your use
The shaggy man hesitated
Dorothy had never known him to be ashamed of his shaggy looks before but now that he was surrounded by so much magnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place
Dorothy assured him that all her friends were welcome at Ozmas palace so he carefully dusted his shaggy shoes with his shaggy handkerchief and entered the grand hall after the others
Tiktok lived at the Royal Palace and the Tin Woodman always had the same room whenever he visited Ozma so these two went at once to remove the dust of the journey from their shining bodies
Dorothy also had a pretty suite of rooms which she always occupied when in the Emerald City but several servants walked ahead politely to show the way although she was quite sure she could find the rooms herself
She took ButtonBright with her because he seemed too small to be left alone in such a big palace but Jellia Jamb herself ushered the beautiful Daughter of the Rainbow to her apartments because it was easy to see that Polychrome was used to splendid palaces and was therefore entitled to especial attention
19
The Shaggy Mans Welcome The shaggy man stood in the great hall his shaggy hat in his hands wondering what would become of him
He had never been a guest in a fine palace before perhaps he had never been a guest anywhere
In the big cold outside world people did not invite shaggy men to their homes and this shaggy man of ours had slept more in haylofts and stables than in comfortable rooms
When the others left the great hall he eyed the splendidly dressed servants of the Princess Ozma as if he expected to be ordered out but one of them bowed before him as respectfully as if he had been a prince and said Permit me sir to conduct you to your apartments
The shaggy man drew a long breath and took courage
Very well he answered
Im ready
Through the big hall they went up the grand staircase carpeted thick with velvet and so along a wide corridor to a carved doorway
Here the servant paused and opening the door said with polite deference Be good enough to enter sir and make yourself at home in the rooms our Royal Ozma has ordered prepared for you
Whatever you see is for you to use and enjoy as if your own
The Princess dines at seven and I shall be here in time to lead you to the drawingroom where you will be privileged to meet the lovely Ruler of Oz
Is there any command in the meantime with which you desire to honor me
No said the shaggy man but Im much obliged
He entered the room and shut the door and for a time stood in bewilderment admiring the grandeur before him
He had been given one of the handsomest apartments in the most magnificent palace in the world and you can not wonder that his good fortune astonished and awed him until he grew used to his surroundings
The furniture was upholstered in cloth of gold with the royal crown embroidered upon it in scarlet
The rug upon the marble floor was so thick and soft that he could not hear the sound of his own footsteps and upon the walls were splendid tapestries woven with scenes from the Land of Oz
Books and ornaments were scattered about in profusion and the shaggy man thought he had never seen so many pretty things in one place before
In one corner played a tinkling fountain of perfumed water and in another was a table bearing a golden tray loaded with freshly gathered fruit including several of the redcheeked apples that the shaggy man loved
At the farther end of this charming room was an open doorway and he crossed over to find himself in a bedroom containing more comforts than the shaggy man had ever before imagined
The bedstead was of gold and set with many brilliant diamonds and the coverlet had designs of pearls and rubies sewed upon it
At one side of the bedroom was a dainty dressingroom with closets containing a large assortment of fresh clothing and beyond this was the batha large room having a marble pool big enough to swim in with white marble steps leading down to the water
Around the edge of the pool were set rows of fine emeralds as large as doorknobs while the water of the bath was clear as crystal
For a time the shaggy man gazed upon all this luxury with silent amazement
Then he decided being wise in his way to take advantage of his good fortune
He removed his shaggy boots and his shaggy clothing and bathed in the pool with rare enjoyment
After he had dried himself with the soft towels he went into the dressingroom and took fresh linen from the drawers and put it on finding that everything fitted him exactly
He examined the contents of the closets and selected an elegant suit of clothing
Strangely enough everything about it was shaggy although so new and beautiful and he sighed with contentment to realize that he could now be finely dressed and still be the shaggy man
His coat was of rosecolored velvet trimmed with shags and bobtails with buttons of bloodred rubies and golden shags around the edges
His vest was a shaggy satin of a delicate cream color and his kneebreeches of rose velvet trimmed like the coat
Shaggy creamy stockings of silk and shaggy slippers of rose leather with ruby buckles completed his costume and when he was thus attired the shaggy man looked at himself in a long mirror with great admiration
On a table he found a motherofpearl chest decorated with delicate silver vines and flowers of clustered rubies and on the cover was a silver plate engraved with these words THE SHAGGY MAN HIS BOX OF ORNAMENTS The chest was not locked so he opened it and was almost dazzled by the brilliance of the rich jewels it contained
After admiring the pretty things he took out a fine golden watch with a big chain several handsome fingerrings and an ornament of rubies to pin upon the breast of his shaggy shirtbosom
Having carefully brushed his hair and whiskers all the wrong way to make them look as shaggy as possible the shaggy man breathed a deep sigh of joy and decided he was ready to meet the Royal Princess as soon as she sent for him
While he waited he returned to the beautiful sitting room and ate several of the redcheeked apples to pass away the time
Meanwhile Dorothy had dressed herself in a pretty gown of soft grey embroidered with silver and put a blueandgold suit of satin upon little ButtonBright who looked as sweet as a cherub in it
Followed by the boy and Totothe dog with a new green ribbon around his neckshe hastened down to the splendid drawingroom of the palace where seated upon an exquisite throne of carved malachite and nestled amongst its green satin cushions was the lovely Princess Ozma waiting eagerly to welcome her friend
20
Princess Ozma Of Oz The royal historians of Oz who are fine writers and know any number of big words have often tried to describe the rare beauty of Ozma and failed because the words were not good enough
So of course I cannot hope to tell you how great was the charm of this little Princess or how her loveliness put to shame all the sparkling jewels and magnificent luxury that surrounded her in this her royal palace
Whatever else was beautiful or dainty or delightful of itself faded to dullness when contrasted with Ozmas bewitching face and it has often been said by those who know that no other ruler in all the world can ever hope to equal the gracious charm of her manner
Everything about Ozma attracted one and she inspired love and the sweetest affection rather than awe or ordinary admiration
Dorothy threw her arms around her little friend and hugged and kissed her rapturously and Toto barked joyfully and ButtonBright smiled a happy smile and consented to sit on the soft cushions close beside the Princess
Why didnt you send me word you were going to have a birthday party
asked the little Kansas girl when the first greetings were over
Didnt I
asked Ozma her pretty eyes dancing with merriment
Did you
replied Dorothy trying to think
Who do you imagine dear mixed up those roads so as to start you wandering in the direction of Oz
inquired the Princess
Oh
I never spected YOU of that cried Dorothy
Ive watched you in my Magic Picture all the way here declared Ozma and twice I thought I should have to use the Magic Belt to save you and transport you to the Emerald City
Once was when the Scoodlers caught you and again when you reached the Deadly Desert
But the shaggy man was able to help you out both times so I did not interfere
Do you know who ButtonBright is
asked Dorothy
No I never saw him until you found him in the road and then only in my Magic Picture
And did you send Polly to us
No dear the Rainbows Daughter slid from her fathers pretty arch just in time to meet you
Well said Dorothy Ive promised King Dox of Foxville and King Kikabray of Dunkiton that Id ask you to invite them to your party
I have already done that returned Ozma because I thought it would please you to favor them
Did you vite the Musicker
asked ButtonBright
No because he would be too noisy and might interfere with the comfort of others
When music is not very good and is indulged in all the time it is better that the performer should be alone said the Princess
I like the Musickers music declared the boy gravely
But I dont said Dorothy
Well there will be plenty of music at my celebration promised Ozma so Ive an idea ButtonBright wont miss the Musicker at all
Just then Polychrome danced in and Ozma rose to greet the Rainbows Daughter in her sweetest and most cordial manner
Dorothy thought she had never seen two prettier creatures together than these lovely maidens but Polly knew at once her own dainty beauty could not match that of Ozma yet was not a bit jealous because this was so
The Wizard of Oz was announced and a driedup little old man clothed all in black entered the drawingroom
His face was cheery and his eyes twinkling with humor so Polly and ButtonBright were not at all afraid of the wonderful personage whose fame as a humbug magician had spread throughout the world
After greeting Dorothy with much affection he stood modestly behind Ozmas throne and listened to the lively prattle of the young people
Now the shaggy man appeared and so startling was his appearance all clad in shaggy new rainment that Dorothy cried Oh
and clasped her hands impulsively as she examined her friend with pleased eyes
Hes still shaggy all right remarked ButtonBright and Ozma nodded brightly because she had meant the shaggy man to remain shaggy when she provided his new clothes for him
Dorothy led him toward the throne as he was shy in such fine company and presented him gracefully to the Princess saying This your Highness is my friend the shaggy man who owns the Love Magnet
You are welcome to Oz said the girl Ruler in gracious accents
But tell me sir where did you get the Love Magnet which you say you own
The shaggy man grew red and looked downcast as he answered in a low voice I stole it your Majesty
Oh Shaggy Man
cried Dorothy
How dreadful
And you told me the Eskimo gave you the Love Magnet
He shuffled first on one foot and then on the other much embarrassed
I told you a falsehood Dorothy he said but now having bathed in the Truth Pond I must tell nothing but the truth
Why did you steal it
asked Ozma gently
Because no one loved me or cared for me said the shaggy man and I wanted to be loved a great deal
It was owned by a girl in Butterfield who was loved too much so that the young men quarreled over her which made her unhappy
After I had stolen the Magnet from her only one young man continued to love the girl and she married him and regained her happiness
Are you sorry you stole it
asked the Princess
No your Highness Im glad he answered for it has pleased me to be loved and if Dorothy had not cared for me I could not have accompanied her to this beautiful Land of Oz or met its kindhearted Ruler
Now that Im here I hope to remain and to become one of your Majestys most faithful subjects
But in Oz we are loved for ourselves alone and for our kindness to one another and for our good deeds she said
Ill give up the Love Magnet said the shaggy man eagerly Dorothy shall have it
But every one loves Dorothy already declared the Wizard
Then ButtonBright shall have it
Dont want it said the boy promptly
Then Ill give it to the Wizard for Im sure the lovely Princess Ozma does not need it
All my people love the Wizard too announced the Princess laughing so we will hang the Love Magnet over the gates of the Emerald City that whoever shall enter or leave the gates may be loved and loving
That is a good idea said the shaggy man I agree to it most willingly
Those assembled now went in to dinner which you can imagine was a grand affair and afterward Ozma asked the Wizard to give them an exhibition of his magic
The Wizard took eight tiny white piglets from an inside pocket and set them on the table
One was dressed like a clown and performed funny antics and the others leaped over the spoons and dishes and ran around the table like racehorses and turned handsprings and were so sprightly and amusing that they kept the company in one roar of merry laughter
The Wizard had trained these pets to do many curious things and they were so little and so cunning and soft that Polychrome loved to pick them up as they passed near her place and fondle them as if they were kittens
It was late when the entertainment ended and they separated to go to their rooms
Tomorrow said Ozma my invited guests will arrive and you will find among them some interesting and curious people I promise you
The next day will be my birthday and the festivities will be held on the broad green just outside the gates of the City where all my people can assemble without being crowded
I hope the Scarecrow wont be late said Dorothy anxiously
Oh he is sure to return tomorrow answered Ozma
He wanted new straw to stuff himself with so he went to the Munchkin Country where straw is plentiful
With this the Princess bade her guests good night and went to her own room
21
Dorothy Receives the Guests Next morning Dorothys breakfast was served in her own pretty sitting room and she sent to invite Polly and the shaggy man to join her and ButtonBright at the meal
They came gladly and Toto also had breakfast with them so that the little party that had traveled together to Oz was once more reunited
No sooner had they finished eating than they heard the distant blast of many trumpets and the sound of a brass band playing martial music so they all went out upon the balcony
This was at the front of the palace and overlooked the streets of the City being higher than the wall that shut in the palace grounds
They saw approaching down the street a band of musicians playing as hard and loud as they could while the people of the Emerald City crowded the sidewalks and cheered so lustily that they almost drowned the noise of the drums and horns
Dorothy looked to see what they were cheering at and discovered that behind the band was the famous Scarecrow riding proudly upon the back of a wooden SawHorse which pranced along the street almost as gracefully as if it had been made of flesh
Its hoofs or rather the ends of its wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold and the saddle strapped to the wooden body was richly embroidered and glistened with jewels
As he reached the palace the Scarecrow looked up and saw Dorothy and at once waved his peaked hat at her in greeting
He rode up to the front door and dismounted and the band stopped playing and went away and the crowds of people returned to their dwellings
By the time Dorothy and her friends had reentered her room the Scarecrow was there and he gave the girl a hearty embrace and shook the hands of the others with his own squashy hands which were white gloves filled with straw
The shaggy man ButtonBright and Polychrome stared hard at this celebrated person who was acknowledged to be the most popular and most beloved man in all the Land of Oz
Why your face has been newly painted
exclaimed Dorothy when the first greetings were over
I had it touched up a bit by the Munchkin farmer who first made me answered the Scarecrow pleasantly
My complexion had become a bit grey and faded you know and the paint had peeled off one end of my mouth so I couldnt talk quite straight
Now I feel like myself again and I may say without immodesty that my body is stuffed with the loveliest oatstraw in all Oz
He pushed against his chest
Hear me crunkle
he asked
Yes said Dorothy you sound fine
ButtonBright was wonderfully attracted by the strawman and so was Polly
The shaggy man treated him with great respect because he was so queerly made
Jellia Jamb now came to say that Ozma wanted Princess Dorothy to receive the invited guests in the ThroneRoom as they arrived
The Ruler was herself busy ordering the preparations for the morrows festivities so she wished her friend to act in her place
Dorothy willingly agreed being the only other Princess in the Emerald City so she went to the great ThroneRoom and sat in Ozmas seat placing Polly on one side of her and ButtonBright on the other
The Scarecrow stood at the left of the throne and the Tin Woodman at the right while the Wonderful Wizard and the shaggy man stood behind
The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger came in with bright new bows of ribbon on their collars and tails
After greeting Dorothy affectionately the huge beasts lay down at the foot of the throne
While they waited the Scarecrow who was near the little boy asked Why are you called ButtonBright
Dont know was the answer
Oh yes you do dear said Dorothy
Tell the Scarecrow how you got your name
Papa always said I was bright as a button so mama always called me ButtonBright announced the boy
Where is your mama
asked the Scarecrow
Dont know said ButtonBright
Where is your home
asked the Scarecrow
Dont know said ButtonBright
Dont you want to find your mama again
asked the Scarecrow
Dont know said ButtonBright calmly
The Scarecrow looked thoughtful
Your papa may have been right he observed but there are many kinds of buttons you see
There are silver and gold buttons which are highly polished and glitter brightly
There are pearl and rubber buttons and other kinds with surfaces more or less bright
But there is still another sort of button which is covered with dull cloth and that must be the sort your papa meant when he said you were bright as a button
Dont you think so
Dont know said ButtonBright
Jack Pumpkinhead arrived wearing a pair of new white kid gloves and he brought a birthday present for Ozma consisting of a necklace of pumpkinseeds
In each seed was set a sparkling carolite which is considered the rarest and most beautiful gem that exists
The necklace was in a plush case and Jellia Jamb put it on a table with the Princess Ozmas other presents
Next came a tall beautiful woman clothed in a splendid trailing gown trimmed with exquisite lace as fine as cobweb
This was the important Sorceress known as Glinda the Good who had been of great assistance to both Ozma and Dorothy
There was no humbug about her magic you may be sure and Glinda was as kind as she was powerful
She greeted Dorothy most lovingly and kissed ButtonBright and Polly and smiled upon the shaggy man after which Jellia Jamb led the Sorceress to one of the most magnificent rooms of the royal palace and appointed fifty servants to wait upon her
The next arrival was Mr H M WoggleBug TE
 the H M meaning Highly Magnified and the TE
meaning Thoroughly Educated
The WoggleBug was head professor at the Royal College of Oz and he had composed a fine Ode in honor of Ozmas birthday
This he wanted to read to them but the Scarecrow wouldnt let him
Soon they heard a clucking sound and a chorus of cheep
cheep
and a servant threw open the door to allow Billina and her ten fluffy chicks to enter the ThroneRoom
As the Yellow Hen marched proudly at the head of her family Dorothy cried Oh you lovely things
and ran down from her seat to pet the little yellow downy balls
Billina wore a pearl necklace and around the neck of each chicken was a tiny gold chain holding a locket with the letter D engraved upon the outside
Open the lockets Dorothy said Billina
The girl obeyed and found a picture of herself in each locket
They were named after you my dear continued the Yellow Hen so I wanted all my chickens to wear your picture
Cluckcluck
come here Dorothythis minute
she cried for the chickens were scattered and wandering all around the big room
They obeyed the call at once and came running as fast as they could fluttering their fluffy wings in a laughable way
It was lucky that Billina gathered the little ones under her soft breast just then for Tiktok came in and tramped up to the throne on his flat copper feet
I am all wound up and working finely said the clockwork man to Dorothy
I can hear him tick declared ButtonBright
You are quite the polished gentleman said the Tin Woodman
Stand up here beside the shaggy man Tiktok and help receive the company
Dorothy placed soft cushions in a corner for Billina and her chicks and had just returned to the Throne and seated herself when the playing of the royal band outside the palace announced the approach of distinguished guests
And my how they did stare when the High Chamberlain threw open the doors and the visitors entered the ThroneRoom
First walked a gingerbread man neatly formed and baked to a lovely brown tint
He wore a silk hat and carried a candy cane prettily striped with red and yellow
His shirtfront and cuffs were white frosting and the buttons on his coat were licorice drops
Behind the gingerbread man came a child with flaxen hair and merry blue eyes dressed in white pajamas with sandals on the soles of its pretty bare feet
The child looked around smiling and thrust its hands into the pockets of the pajamas
Close after it came a big rubber bear walking erect on its hind feet
The bear had twinkling black eyes and its body looked as if it had been pumped full of air
Following these curious visitors were two tall thin men and two short fat men all four dressed in gorgeous uniforms
Ozmas High Chamberlain now hurried forward to announce the names of the new arrivals calling out in a loud voice His Gracious and Most Edible Majesty King Dough the First Ruler of the Two Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland
Also the Head Boolywag of his Majesty known as Chick the Cherub and their faithful friend Para Bruin the rubber bear
These great personages bowed low as their names were called and Dorothy hastened to introduce them to the assembled company
They were the first foreign arrivals and the friends of Princess Ozma were polite to them and tried to make them feel that they were welcome
Chick the Cherub shook hands with every one including Billina and was so joyous and frank and full of good spirits that John Doughs Head Booleywag at once became a prime favorite
Is it a boy or a girl
whispered Dorothy
Dont know said ButtonBright
Goodness me
what a queer lot of people you are exclaimed the rubber bear looking at the assembled company
Sore you said ButtonBright gravely
Is King Dough good to eat
Hes too good to eat laughed Chick the Cherub
I hope none of you are fond of gingerbread said the King rather anxiously
We should never think of eating our visitors if we were declared the Scarecrow so please do not worry for you will be perfectly safe while you remain in Oz
Why do they call you Chick
the Yellow Hen asked the child
Because Im an Incubator Baby and never had any parents replied the Head Booleywag
My chicks have a parent and Im it said Billina
Im glad of that answered the Cherub because theyll have more fun worrying you than if they were brought up in an Incubator
The Incubator never worries you know
King John Dough had brought for Ozmas birthday present a lovely gingerbread crown with rows of small pearls around it and a fine big pearl in each of its five points
After this had been received by Dorothy with proper thanks and placed on the table with the other presents the visitors from Hiland and Loland were escorted to their rooms by the High Chamberlain
They had no sooner departed than the band before the palace began to play again announcing more arrivals and as these were doubtless from foreign parts the High Chamberlain hurried back to receive them in his most official manner
22
Important Arrivals First entered a band of Ryls from the Happy Valley all merry little sprites like fairy elves
A dozen crooked Knooks followed from the great Forest of Burzee
They had long whiskers and pointed caps and curling toes yet were no taller than ButtonBrights shoulder
With this group came a man so easy to recognize and so important and dearly beloved throughout the known world that all present rose to their feet and bowed their heads in respectful homage even before the High Chamberlain knelt to announce his name
The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children His Supreme HighnessSanta Claus
said the Chamberlain in an awed voice
Well well well
Glad to see youglad to meet you all
cried Santa Claus briskly as he trotted up the long room
He was round as an apple with a fresh rosy face laughing eyes and a bushy beard as white as snow
A red cloak trimmed with beautiful ermine hung from his shoulders and upon his back was a basket filled with pretty presents for the Princess Ozma
Hello Dorothy still having adventures
he asked in his jolly way as he took the girls hand in both his own
How did you know my name Santa
she replied feeling more shy in the presence of this immortal saint than she ever had before in her young life
Why dont I see you every Christmas Eve when youre asleep
he rejoined pinching her blushing cheek
Oh do you
And heres ButtonBright I declare
cried Santa Claus holding up the boy to kiss him
What a long way from home you are dear me
Do you know ButtonBright too
questioned Dorothy eagerly
Indeed I do
Ive visited his home several Christmas Eves
And do you know his father
asked the girl
Certainly my dear
Who else do you suppose brings him his Christmas neckties and stockings
with a sly wink at the Wizard
Then where does he live
Were just crazy to know cause ButtonBrights lost she said
Santa laughed and laid his finger aside of his nose as if thinking what to reply
He leaned over and whispered something in the Wizards ear at which the Wizard smiled and nodded as if he understood
Now Santa Claus spied Polychrome and trotted over to where she stood
Seems to me the Rainbows Daughter is farther from home than any of you he observed looking at the pretty maiden admiringly
Ill have to tell your father where you are Polly and send him to get you
Please do dear Santa Claus implored the little maid beseechingly
But just now we must all have a jolly good time at Ozmas party said the old gentleman turning to put his presents on the table with the others already there
It isnt often I find time to leave my castle as you know but Ozma invited me and I just couldnt help coming to celebrate the happy occasion
Im so glad
exclaimed Dorothy
These are my Ryls pointing to the little sprites squatting around him
Their business is to paint the colors of the flowers when they bud and bloom but I brought the merry fellows along to see Oz and theyve left their paintpots behind them
Also I brought these crooked Knooks whom I love
My dears the Knooks are much nicer than they look for their duty is to water and care for the young trees of the forest and they do their work faithfully and well
Its hard work though and it makes my Knooks crooked and gnarled like the trees themselves but their hearts are big and kind as are the hearts of all who do good in our beautiful world
Ive read of the Ryls and Knooks said Dorothy looking upon these little workers with interest
Santa Claus turned to talk with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and he also said a kind word to the shaggy man and afterward went away to ride the SawHorse around the Emerald City
For said he I must see all the grand sights while I am here and have the chance and Ozma has promised to let me ride the SawHorse because Im getting fat and short of breath
Where are your reindeer
asked Polychrome
I left them at home for it is too warm for them in this sunny country he answered
Theyre used to winter weather when they travel
In a flash he was gone and the Ryls and Knooks with him but they could all hear the golden hoofs of the SawHorse ringing on the marble pavement outside as he pranced away with his noble rider
Presently the band played again and the High Chamberlain announced Her Gracious Majesty the Queen of Merryland
They looked earnestly to discover whom this queen might be and saw advancing up the room an exquisite wax doll dressed in dainty fluffs and ruffles and spangled gown
She was almost as big as ButtonBright and her cheeks and mouth and eyebrow were prettily painted in delicate colors
Her blue eyes stared a bit being of glass yet the expression upon her Majestys face was quite pleasant and decidedly winning
With the Queen of Merryland were four wooden soldiers two stalking ahead of her with much dignity and two following behind like a royal bodyguard
The soldiers were painted in bright colors and carried wooden guns and after them came a fat little man who attracted attention at once although he seemed modest and retiring
For he was made of candy and carried a tin sugarsifter filled with powdered sugar with which he dusted himself frequently so that he wouldnt stick to things if he touched them
The High Chamberlain had called him The Candy Man of Merryland and Dorothy saw that one of his thumbs looked as if it had been bitten off by some one who was fond of candy and couldnt resist the temptation
The wax doll Queen spoke prettily to Dorothy and the others and sent her loving greetings to Ozma before she retired to the rooms prepared for her
She had brought a birthday present wrapped in tissue paper and tied with pink and blue ribbons and one of the wooden soldiers placed it on the table with the other gifts
But the Candy Man did not go to his room because he said he preferred to stay and talk with the Scarecrow and Tiktok and the Wizard and Tin Woodman whom he declared the queerest people he had ever met
ButtonBright was glad the Candy Man stayed in the Throne Room because the boy thought this guest smelled deliciously of wintergreen and maple sugar
The Braided Man now entered the room having been fortunate enough to receive an invitation to the Princess Ozmas party
He was from a cave halfway between the Invisible Valley and the Country of the Gargoyles and his hair and whiskers were so long that he was obliged to plait them into many braids that hung to his feet and every braid was tied with a bow of colored ribbon
Ive brought Princess Ozma a box of flutters for her birthday said the Braided Man earnestly and I hope she will like them for they are the finest quality I have ever made
Im sure she will be greatly pleased said Dorothy who remembered the Braided Man well and the Wizard introduced the guest to the rest of the company and made him sit down in a chair and keep quiet for if allowed he would talk continually about his flutters
The band then played a welcome to another set of guests and into the ThroneRoom swept the handsome and stately Queen of Ev
Beside her was young King Evardo and following them came the entire royal family of five Princesses and four Princes of Ev
The Kingdom of Ev lay just across the Deadly Desert to the North of Oz and once Ozma and her people had rescued the Queen of Ev and her ten children from the Nome King who had enslaved them
Dorothy had been present on this adventure so she greeted the royal family cordially and all the visitors were delighted to meet the little Kansas girl again
They knew Tiktok and Billina too and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman as well as the Lion and Tiger so there was a joyful reunion as you may imagine and it was fully an hour before the Queen and her train retired to their rooms
Perhaps they would not have gone then had not the band begun to play to announce new arrivals but before they left the great ThroneRoom King Evardo added to Ozmas birthday presents a diadem of diamonds set in radium
The next comer proved to be King Renard of Foxville or King Dox as he preferred to be called
He was magnificently dressed in a new feather costume and wore white kid mittens over his paws and a flower in his buttonhole and had his hair parted in the middle
King Dox thanked Dorothy fervently for getting him the invitation to come to Oz which he all his life longed to visit
He strutted around rather absurdly as he was introduced to all the famous people assembled in the ThroneRoom and when he learned that Dorothy was a Princess of Oz the Fox King insisted on kneeling at her feet and afterward retired backwarda dangerous thing to do as he might have stubbed his paw and tumbled over
No sooner was he gone than the blasts of bugles and clatter of drums and cymbals announced important visitors and the High Chamberlain assumed his most dignified tone as he threw open the door and said proudly Her Sublime and Resplendent Majesty Queen Zixi of Ix
His Serene and Tremendous Majesty King Bud of Noland
Her Royal Highness the Princess Fluff
That three such high and mighty royal personages should arrive at once was enough to make Dorothy and her companions grow solemn and assume their best company manners but when the exquisite beauty of Queen Zixi met their eyes they thought they had never beheld anything so charming
Dorothy decided that Zixi must be about sixteen years old but the Wizard whispered to her that this wonderful queen had lived thousands of years but knew the secret of remaining always fresh and beautiful
King Bud of Noland and his dainty fairhaired sister the Princess Fluff were friends of Zixi as their kingdoms were adjoining so they had traveled together from their faroff domains to do honor to Ozma of Oz on the occasion of her birthday
They brought many splendid gifts so the table was now fairly loaded down with presents
Dorothy and Polly loved the Princess Fluff the moment they saw her and little King Bud was so frank and boyish that ButtonBright accepted him as a chum at once and did not want him to go away
But it was after noon now and the royal guests must prepare their toilets for the grand banquet at which they were to assemble that evening to meet the reigning Princess of this Fairyland so Queen Zixi was shown to her room by a troop of maidens led by Jellia Jamb and Bud and Fluff presently withdrew to their own apartments
My
what a big party Ozma is going to have exclaimed Dorothy
I guess the palace will be chock full ButtonBright dont you think so
Dont know said the boy
But we must go to our rooms pretty soon to dress for the banquet continued the girl
I dont have to dress said the Candy Man from Merryland
All I need do is to dust myself with fresh sugar
Tiktok always wears the same suits of clothes said the Tin Woodman and so does our friend the Scarecrow
My feathers are good enough for any occasion cried Billina from her corner
Then I shall leave you four to welcome any new guests that come said Dorothy for ButtonBright and I must look our very best at Ozmas banquet
Who is still to come
asked the Scarecrow
Well theres King Kikabray of Dunkiton and Johnny Dooit and the Good Witch of the North
But Johnny Dooit may not get here until late hes so very busy
We will receive them and give them a proper welcome promised the Scarecrow
So run along little Dorothy and get yourself dressed
23
The Grand Banquet I wish I could tell you how fine the company was that assembled that evening at Ozmas royal banquet
A long table was spread in the center of the great dininghall of the palace and the splendor of the decorations and the blaze of lights and jewels was acknowledged to be the most magnificent sight that any of the guests had ever seen
The jolliest person present as well as the most important was of course old Santa Claus so he was given the seat of honor at one end of the table while at the other end sat Princess Ozma the hostess
John Dough Queen Zixi King Bud the Queen of Ev and her son Evardo and the Queen of Merryland had golden thrones to sit in while the others were supplied with beautiful chairs
At the upper end of the banquet room was a separate table provided for the animals
Toto sat at one end of this table with a bib tied around his neck and a silver platter to eat from
At the other end was placed a small stand with a low rail around the edge of it for Billina and her chicks
The rail kept the ten little Dorothys from falling off the stand while the Yellow Hen could easily reach over and take her food from her tray upon the table
At other places sat the Hungry Tiger the Cowardly Lion the SawHorse the Rubber Bear the Fox King and the Donkey King they made quite a company of animals
At the lower end of the great room was another table at which sat the Ryls and Knooks who had come with Santa Claus the wooden soldiers who had come with the Queen of Merryland and the Hilanders and Lolanders who had come with John Dough
Here were also seated the officers of the royal palace and of Ozmas army
The splendid costumes of those at the three tables made a gorgeous and glittering display that no one present was ever likely to forget perhaps there has never been in any part of the world at any time another assemblage of such wonderful people as that which gathered this evening to honor the birthday of the Ruler of Oz
When all members of ethe company were in their places an orchestra of five hundred pieces in a balcony overlooking the banquet room began to play sweet and delightful music
Then a door draped with royal green opened and in came the fair and girlish Princess Ozma who now greeted her guests in person for the first time
As she stood by her throne at the head of the banquet table every eye was turned eagerly upon the lovely Princess who was as dignified as she was bewitching and who smiled upon all her old and new friends in a way that touched their hearts and brought an answering smile to every face
Each guest had been served with a crystal goblet filled with lacasa which is a sort of nectar famous in Oz and nicer to drink than sodawater or lemonade
Santa now made a pretty speech in verse congratulating Ozma on having a birthday and asking every one present to drink to the health and happiness of their dearly beloved hostess
This was done with great enthusiasm by those who were made so they could drink at all and those who could not drink politely touched the rims of their goblets to their lips
All seated themselves at the tables and the servants of the Princess began serving the feast
I am quite sure that only in Fairyland could such a delicious repast be prepared
The dishes were of precious metals set with brilliant jewels and the good things to eat which were placed upon them were countless in number and of exquisite flavor
Several present such as the Candy Man the Rubber Bear Tiktok and the Scarecrow were not made so they could eat and the Queen of Merryland contented herself with a small dish of sawdust but these enjoyed the pomp and glitter of the gorgeous scene as much as did those who feasted
The WoggleBug read his Ode to Ozma which was written in very good rhythm and was well received by the company
The Wizard added to the entertainment by making a big pie appear before Dorothy and when the little girl cut the pie the nine tiny piglets leaped out of it and danced around the table while the orchestra played a merry tune
This amused the company very much but they were even more pleased when Polychrome whose hunger had been easily satisfied rose from the table and performed her graceful and bewildering Rainbow Dance for them
When it was ended the people clapped their hands and the animals clapped their paws while Billina cackled and the Donkey King brayed approval
Johnny Dooit was present and of course he proved he could do wonders in the way of eating as well as in everything else that he undertook to do the Tin Woodman sang a love song every one joining in the chorus and the wooden soldiers from Merryland gave an exhibition of a lightning drill with their wooden muskets the Ryls and Knooks danced the Fairy Circle and the Rubber Bear bounced himself all around the room
There was laughter and merriment on every side and everybody was having a royal good time
ButtonBright was so excited and interested that he paid little attention to his fine dinner and a great deal of attention to his queer companions and perhaps he was wise to do this because he could eat at any other time
The feasting and merrymaking continued until late in the evening when they separated to meet again the next morning and take part in the birthday celebration to which this royal banquet was merely the introduction
24
The Birthday Celebration A clear perfect day with a gentle breeze and a sunny sky greeted Princess Ozma as she wakened next morning the anniversary of her birth
While it was yet early all the city was astir and crowds of people came from all parts of the Land of Oz to witness the festivities in honor of their girl Rulers birthday
The noted visitors from foreign countries who had all been transported to the Emerald City by means of the Magic Belt were as much a show to the Ozites as were their own familiar celebrities and the streets leading from the royal palace to the jeweled gates were thronged with men women and children to see the procession as it passed out to the green fields where the ceremonies were to take place
And what a great procession it was
First came a thousand young girlsthe prettiest in the landdressed in white muslin with green sashes and hair ribbons bearing green baskets of red roses
As they walked they scattered these flowers upon the marble pavements so that the way was carpeted thick with roses for the procession to walk upon
Then came the Rulers of the four Kingdoms of Oz the Emperor of the Winkies the Monarch of the Munchkins the King of the Quadlings and the Sovereign of the Gillikins each wearing a long chain of emeralds around his neck to show that he was a vassal of the Ruler of the Emerald City
Next marched the Emerald City Cornet Band clothed in greenandgold uniforms and playing the Ozma TwoStep
The Royal Army of Oz followed consisting of twentyseven officers from the CaptainGeneral down to the Lieutenants
There were no privates in Ozmas Army because soldiers were not needed to fight battles but only to look important and an officer always looks more imposing than a private
While the people cheered and waved their hats and handkerchiefs there came walking the Royal Princess Ozma looking so pretty and sweet that it is no wonder her people love her so dearly
She had decided she would not ride in her chariot that day as she preferred to walk in the procession with her favored subjects and her guests
Just in front of her trotted the living Blue Bear Rug owned by old Dyna which wobbled clumsily on its four feet because there was nothing but the skin to support them with a stuffed head at one end and a stubby tail at the other
But whenever Ozma paused in her walk the Bear Rug would flop down flat upon the ground for the princess to stand upon until she resumed her progress
Following the Princess stalked her two enormous beasts the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger and even if the Army had not been there these two would have been powerful enough to guard their mistress from any harm
Next marched the invited guests who were loudly cheered by the people of Oz along the road and were therefore obliged to bow to right and left almost every step of the way
First was Santa Claus who because he was fat and not used to walking rode the wonderful SawHorse
The merry old gentleman had a basket of small toys with him and he tossed the toys one by one to the children as he passed by
His Ryls and Knooks marched close behind him
Queen Zixi of Ix came after then John Dough and the Cherub with the rubber bear named Para Bruin strutting between them on its hind legs then the Queen of Merryland escorted by her wooden soldiers then King Bud of Noland and his sister the Princess Fluff then the Queen of Ev and her ten royal children then the Braided Man and the Candy Man side by side then King Dox of Foxville and King Kikabray of Dunkiton who by this time had become good friends and finally Johnny Dooit in his leather apron smoking his long pipe
These wonderful personages were not more heartily cheered by the people than were those who followed after them in the procession
Dorothy was a general favorite and she walked arm in arm with the Scarecrow who was beloved by all
Then came Polychrome and ButtonBright and the people loved the Rainbows pretty Daughter and the beautiful blueeyed boy as soon as they saw them
The shaggy man in his shaggy new suit attracted much attention because he was such a novelty
With regular steps tramped the machineman Tiktok and there was more cheering when the Wizard of Oz followed in the procession
The WoggleBug and Jack Pumpkinhead were next and behind them Glinda the Sorceress and the Good Witch of the North
Finally came Billina with her brood of chickens to whom she clucked anxiously to keep them together and to hasten them along so they would not delay the procession
Another band followed this time the Tin Band of the Emperor of the Winkies playing a beautiful march called Theres No Plate Like Tin
Then came the servants of the Royal Palace in a long line and behind them all the people joined the procession and marched away through the emerald gates and out upon the broad green
Here had been erected a splendid pavilion with a grandstand big enough to seat all the royal party and those who had taken part in the procession
Over the pavilion which was of green silk and cloth of gold countless banners waved in the breeze
Just in front of this and connected with it by a runway had been built a broad platform so that all the spectators could see plainly the entertainment provided for them
The Wizard now became Master of Ceremonies as Ozma had placed the conduct of the performance in his hands
After the people had all congregated about the platform and the royal party and the visitors were seated in the grandstand the Wizard skillfully performed some feats of juggling glass balls and lighted candles
He tossed a dozen or so of them high in the air and caught them one by one as they came down without missing any
Then he introduced the Scarecrow who did a swordswallowing act that aroused much interest
After this the Tin Woodman gave an exhibition of Swinging the Axe which he made to whirl around him so rapidly that the eye could scarcely follow the motion of the gleaming blade
Glinda the Sorceress then stepped upon the platform and by her magic made a big tree grow in the middle of the space made blossoms appear upon the tree and made the blossoms become delicious fruit called tamornas and so great was the quantity of fruit produced that when the servants climbed the tree and tossed it down to the crowd there was enough to satisfy every person present
Para Bruin the rubber bear climbed to a limb of the big tree rolled himself into a ball and dropped to the platform whence he bounded up again to the limb
He repeated this bouncing act several times to the great delight of all the children present
After he had finished and bowed and returned to his seat Glinda waved her wand and the tree disappeared but its fruit still remained to be eaten
The Good Witch of the North amused the people by transforming ten stones into ten birds the ten birds into ten lambs and the ten lambs into ten little girls who gave a pretty dance and were then transformed into ten stones again just as they were in the beginning
Johnny Dooit next came on the platform with his toolchest and in a few minutes built a great flying machine then put his chest in the machine and the whole thing flew away togetherJohnny and allafter he had bid goodbye to those present and thanked the Princess for her hospitality
The Wizard then announced the last act of all which was considered really wonderful
He had invented a machine to blow huge soapbubbles as big as balloons and this machine was hidden under the platform so that only the rim of the big clay pipe to produce the bubbles showed above the flooring
The tank of soapsuds and the airpumps to inflate the bubbles were out of sight beneath so that when the bubbles began to grow upon the floor of the platform it really seemed like magic to the people of Oz who knew nothing about even the common soapbubbles that our children blow with a penny clay pipe and a basin of soapandwater
The Wizard had invented another thing
Usually soapbubbles are frail and burst easily lasting only a few moments as they float in the air but the Wizard added a sort of glue to his soapsuds which made his bubbles tough and as the glue dried rapidly when exposed to the air the Wizards bubbles were strong enough to float for hours without breaking
He began by blowingby means of his machinery and airpumpsseveral large bubbles which he allowed to float upward into the sky where the sunshine fell upon them and gave them iridescent hues that were most beautiful
This aroused much wonder and delight because it was a new amusement to every one presentexcept perhaps Dorothy and ButtonBright and even they had never seen such big strong bubbles before
The Wizard then blew a bunch of small bubbles and afterward blew a big bubble around them so they were left in the center of it then he allowed the whole mass of pretty globes to float into the air and disappear in the far distant sky
That is really fine
declared Santa Claus who loved toys and pretty things
I think Mr Wizard I shall have you blow a bubble around me then I can float away home and see the country spread out beneath me as I travel
There isnt a spot on earth that I havent visited but I usually go in the nighttime riding behind my swift reindeer
Here is a good chance to observe the country by daylight while I am riding slowly and at my ease
Do you think you will be able to guide the bubble
asked the Wizard
Oh yes I know enough magic to do that replied Santa Claus
You blow the bubble with me inside of it and Ill be sure to get home in safety
Please send me home in a bubble too
begged the Queen of Merryland
Very well madam you shall try the journey first politely answered old Santa
The pretty wax doll bade goodbye to the Princess Ozma and the others and stood on the platform while the Wizard blew a big soapbubble around her
When completed he allowed the bubble to float slowly upward and there could be seen the little Queen of Merryland standing in the middle of it and blowing kisses from her fingers to those below
The bubble took a southerly direction quickly floating out of sight
Thats a very nice way to travel said Princess Fluff
Id like to go home in a bubble too
So the Wizard blew a big bubble around Princess Fluff and another around King Bud her brother and a third one around Queen Zixi and soon these three bubbles had mounted into the sky and were floating off in a group in the direction of the kingdom of Noland
The success of these ventures induced the other guests from foreign lands to undertake bubble journeys also so the Wizard put them one by one inside his bubbles and Santa Claus directed the way they should go because he knew exactly where everybody lived
Finally ButtonBright said I want to go home too
Why so you shall
cried Santa for Im sure your father and mother will be glad to see you again
Mr Wizard please blow a big fine bubble for ButtonBright to ride in and Ill agree to send him home to his family as safe as safe can be
Im sorry said Dorothy with a sigh for she was fond of her little comrade but praps its best for ButtonBright to get home cause his folks must be worrying just dreadful
She kissed the boy and Ozma kissed him too and all the others waved their hands and said goodbye and wished him a pleasant journey
Are you glad to leave us dear
asked Dorothy a little wistfully
Dont know said ButtonBright
He sat down crosslegged on the platform with his sailor hat tipped back on his head and the Wizard blew a beautiful bubble all around him
A minute later it had mounted into the sky sailing toward the west and the last they saw of ButtonBright he was still sitting in the middle of the shining globe and waving his sailor hat at those below
Will you ride in a bubble or shall I send you and Toto home by means of the Magic Belt
the Princess asked Dorothy
Guess Ill use the Belt replied the little girl
Im sort of fraid of those bubbles
Bowwow
said Toto approvingly
He loved to bark at the bubbles as they sailed away but he didnt care to ride in one
Santa Claus decided to go next
He thanked Ozma for her hospitality and wished her many happy returns of the day
Then the Wizard blew a bubble around his chubby little body and smaller bubbles around each of his Ryls and Knooks
As the kind and generous friend of children mounted into the air the people all cheered at the top of their voices for they loved Santa Claus dearly and the little man heard them through the walls of his bubble and waved his hands in return as he smiled down upon them
The band played bravely while every one watched the bubble until it was completely out of sight
How bout you Polly
Dorothy asked her friend
Are you fraid of bubbles too
No answered Polychrome smiling but Santa Claus promised to speak to my father as he passed through the sky
So perhaps I shall get home an easier way
Indeed the little maid had scarcely made this speech when a sudden radiance filled the air and while the people looked on in wonder the end of a gorgeous rainbow slowly settled down upon the platform
With a glad cry the Rainbows Daughter sprang from her seat and danced along the curve of the bow mounting gradually upward while the folds of her gauzy gown whirled and floated around her like a cloud and blended with the colors of the rainbow itself
Goodbye Ozma
Goodbye Dorothy
cried a voice they knew belonged to Polychrome but now the little maidens form had melted wholly into the rainbow and their eyes could no longer see her
Suddenly the end of the rainbow lifted and its colors slowly faded like mist before a breeze
Dorothy sighed deeply and turned to Ozma
Im sorry to lose Polly she said but I guess shes better off with her father cause even the Land of Oz couldnt be like home to a cloud fairy
No indeed replied the Princess but it has been delightful for us to know Polychrome for a little while andwho knowsperhaps we may meet the Rainbows Daughter again some day
The entertainment being now ended all left the pavilion and formed their gay procession back to the Emerald City again
Of Dorothys recent traveling companions only Toto and the shaggy man remained and Ozma had decided to allow the latter to live in Oz for a time at least
If he proved honest and true she promised to let him live there always and the shaggy man was anxious to earn this reward
They had a nice quiet dinner together and passed a pleasant evening with the Scarecrow the Tin Woodman Tiktok and the Yellow Hen for company
When Dorothy bade them goodnight she kissed them all goodbye at the same time
For Ozma had agreed that while Dorothy slept she and Toto should be transported by means of the Magic Belt to her own little bed in the Kansas farmhouse and the little girl laughed as she thought how astonished Uncle Henry and Aunt Em would be when she came down to breakfast with them next morning
Quite content to have had so pleasant an adventure and a little tired by all the days busy scenes Dorothy clasped Toto in her arms and lay down upon the pretty white bed in her room in Ozmas royal palace
Presently she was sound asleep
