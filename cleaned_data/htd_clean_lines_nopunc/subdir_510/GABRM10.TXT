Preface Every normal boy loves a motorboat but words fail to express his enthusiasm when that boat is also a racer
Behind the events recorded in this story are certain facts so that the tale is largely true
The author will be glad if the account of life in the open the adventures and fortunes good or ill the contests and exciting experiences interest his readers even partly as much as they did the boys who shared in the actual occurrences
I have tried to write a story filled with action but devoid of sensationalism and false representations
If my boy friends enjoy the company of the Go Ahead boys I shall feel repaid for my labor

Were off
Look quick or well be out of your sight
The long low motorboat glided smoothly out from the dock to which it had been made fast
Behind it the water boiled as if it had been stirred by some invisible furnace
The graceful lines of the boat its manifest power and speed formed a fitting complement to the bright sunshine and clear air which rested over the waters of the Hudson River
On the dock which the Black Growler was leaving so rapidly behind her were assembled various members of the families represented by the four boys on board the motorboat
Younger brothers and sisters two uncles several aunts not to mention the various fathers and mothers united in a final word of farewell
Handkerchiefs were waved and the sounds of the last faint call came across the intervening waters
The Black Growler was leaving Yonkers to be gone more than a month
The trip was one to which the Go Ahead boys had looked forward with steadily increasing interest
In the first place the boat belonged to Fred Button one of the quartet
Fred now was at the wheel and the expression of pride on his face as he occasionally glanced behind him at his companions was one that indicated something of the feeling in his heart
And indeed there was a substantial basis for Freds pride
Among the many boats on the river the Black Growler moved as if she belonged in a class of her own
People on board the cat boats or yachts and even the passengers on a great passing steamer all stood looking with manifest interest at the darkcolored little boat which was speeding over the waters almost like a thing alive
Fred Button the owner and present pilot of the swift motorboat was the smallest or at least the shortest of the four boys
His age was the same as that of his companions all of whom were about seventeen
His round body and rounder face were evidences that in time what Fred lacked in length he might provide in breadth
Among his companions he was a great favorite and frequently was called by one of the several nicknames which his comrades had bestowed upon him
Peewee or Pygmy the latter sometimes shortened to Pyg were names to which he answered almost as readily as to his Christian name
His most intimate friend of the four was John Clemens whose nickname String indicated what his physique was
He was six feet three inches in height although his weight was not much more than that of the more diminutive Fred
The long and the short of it the two boys sometimes were called when they were seen together
Grant was the one member of the Go Ahead boys who easily led in whatever he attempted
His standing in school was high and his time in the hundred yards dash stood now as a school record
His fund of general information was so large that some years before in a joke he had been dubbed Socrates
That expressive name however had recently been shortened to Soc
George Washington Sanders one of the most popular boys in his school frequently was referred to as Pop by which designation his friends indirectly expressed their admiration for one who even if he bore the name of the Father of his Country was laughingly referred to as the Papa of the Land
This nickname in the course of time had been shortened to Pop
Already the four Go Ahead boys had had several stirring experiences in their summer vacations
One of these had been spent at Mackinac Island where their adventures had been chiefly concerned with Smugglers Island
Together they had made a voyage to the West Indies where their experiences on a desert island have been already recorded
1 Together they had investigated the mysteries connected with an old house near Georges country home a place shunned by the country folk because of its reputation of being haunted
2 Another delightful summer had been spent by the boys in a camp in the Canadian woods
3 All these experiences had only prepared the way for the days which now were confronting them
1 See The Go Ahead Boys and The Treasure Cave
2 The Go Ahead Boys and the Mysterious Old House
3 See The Go Ahead Boys and the Island Camp
Every one was confident that the Black Growler would give a good account of herself in the motorboat races which were to be held on the St Lawrence River
The grandfather of Fred Button who was the fortunate owner of an island in the majestic river had invited the boys to spend a month with him in his cottage
Incidentally he had explained that their visit would be at the time when the boat races occurred which he had no question they all would greatly enjoy
He was unaware that Mr Button had already purchased a motorboat of marvelous speed although at the time he had no thought that it would be entered in any contest or races
Yielding to Freds persuasions at last his father had somewhat reluctantly given his consent for the boat to be entered as well as for Fred to invite the other three Go Ahead boys to spend the coming weeks together on the island
All these thoughts were more or less in the minds of the Go Ahead boys when the Black Growler swiftly started on her long voyage
Are you going to keep her going like this all the time
demanded John as the swift little boat steadily continued on her way
She doesnt like to slow up replied Fred glancing behind him as he spoke
She had better slow up than blow up retorted John
No danger of that laughed Fred
The first thing you know well be in the canal
I hope not laughed Grant
It will be a great day when the Go Ahead boys learn how to use the English language
You dont mean in the canal you mean on the canal
Perhaps he means what my grandfather used to call the ragin canawl suggested Grant
Maybe well be both IN it and ON it laughed Fred
If we should happen to strike a rock or bump into another boat it wouldnt be very hard to understand what would follow
That makes me think said Grant solemnly
Are you sure that you know how to steer
If we were traveling on the Erie Canal as they used to go soon after it was opened When was that
broke in George
1825
The Erie Canal extended from Albany to Lake Erie and was constructed chiefly because DeWitt Clinton worked for it with might and main from 1817 to 1825
Good for you
laughed George Its pretty hard to trip up old Soc when it comes to figures
Now I myself happen to know how long the canal is and so I shall be able to tell whether you reeled off your figures depending upon our ignorance or whether you gave them because you knew what they are
How long is the Erie Canal
he added slowly
Three hundred and fifty and onehalf miles though I find some authorities give it as three hundred and fiftytwo miles laughed Grant
Splendid
Splendid
retorted George solemnly
I suppose you know all about all the other great canals too
I have looked them up replied Grant simply
I dont believe in starting off on a trip like ours without finding out some of the facts connected with it
Dont ask me
Dont ask me
protested John quickly
I havent been looking them up so I dont know
I didnt say I was going to ask you retorted Grant
I told you I was going to inform you
I looked them up for the benefit of my benighted companions
Now theres the Cape Cod Canal he added
I dont believe theres one of you that knows anything about it
If we dont stop you there wont be one of us that doesnt know ALL about it said John pretending to be discouraged by the attitude of his friend
I suppose well have to have it he added solemnly so the sooner we get it out of the way the better
Tell us and have it over with
The Cape Cod Canal said Grant as he looked sternly at John is eight miles long it is twentyfive feet deep and one hundred feet wide
My now I am almost ready to go back home
said George solemnly
I cannot imagine finding out anything more important than that
Have you noticed these Palisades we have been passing
Did you ever see anything more beautiful than the river
Pretty soon well come to the Highlands and to West Point and I want to say to you right now Soc that I would rather know about these things than I would to hear about a ditch that is one hundred feet wide and twentyfive feet deep and eight miles long
Whats the good of knowing that anyway
I shall try to improve your mind before we come back home said Grant shaking his head
You dont expect to accomplish much in just a month do you
interposed George
Not much more than to get ready to prepare to begin to start to commence on the contract
My what a fluent talker my friend is
said George
He never is at a loss for a word
It doesnt make any difference to him whether he knows what it means or not
Never mind your old facts and figures spoke up Fred
I want you to notice that big
black yacht yonder
Isnt she a beauty
She is that replied Grant with enthusiasm
I can almost make out her name he added as he looked through the fieldglasses
There it is CaleCaledonia he added quickly
They have got quite a good many people on board suggested George as he noticed a group of boys and girls near the rail who apparently were as deeply interested in the motorboat as the Go Ahead boys were in the big black yacht
Lets have a race with her suggested George
Start her up Fred and see if the yacht will try to keep up with us
Fred laughingly complied with the request although neither of his companions had any suspicion of the many experiences they were to have with the passengers and crew of the Caledonia before either vessel returned to New York
CHAPTER II ON THE WAY The proposed race however did not take place
The graceful Caledonia steadily continued on her way without increasing her speed
There were calls from the deck where the boys noticed several young people standing near the rail
It was plain that there was great admiration on each boat for the beauty and speed of the other
There were calls and cheers and waving of handkerchiefs to express their feelings
Perhaps it was in part due to this fact that the Black Growler soon began to pull away from the larger boat and not long afterward the Caledonia was left far behind
Thats the kind of a boat Im going to have when I get rich
said George enthusiastically
I should like to spend about four months a year on board a craft like that
Thats all right spoke up Grant but I think after about two months of it you would want something else
You see I know you better than you know yourself
Yes I see retorted George sharply
You make me think of what Josh Billings said that its a good deal better not to know so many things than it is to know so many things that aint so
 Never you mind fellows spoke up Fred
This boat suits me all right
You wait until you see that cup the Black Growler is going to win
I hope we shant have to wait too long said John dryly
Youll wait until the race comes off declared Fred
Im not taking any cups before I win them but when the time comes you wait and see me run away from any boat that tries to keep up with us
I have been on the St Lawrence before and unless there is something a good deal better than I have ever seen there we shall simply show our heels to any motorboats on the river
And they say there are more motorboats between Clayton and Ogdensburg than anywhere else in America
How many
inquired John
I have been told that there are more than a thousand
Well said George Im deeply impressed by the modesty of Peewee
He simply thinks this boat will outclass nine hundred and ninetynine others that will be madly chasing him all summer long trying to keep pace with him
But he hasnt won the cup yet said Grant quietly
Thats right
Thats right spoke up Fred pretending to be annoyed by the bantering of his friends
There are always some people that try to take the joy out of life
I heard of an old man the other day who was so disgruntled that when he met a friend on the street who saluted him with a hearty good morning this old man looked all over the sky to make sure he couldnt find a cloud somewhere and say that it wasnt a good morning
What did he do if he didnt find any
laughed George
Why he put his hand on his stomach as if he had a pain and shook his head and closed his eyes and groaned out Yes its a fine day but I am sure it is a weatherbreeder
Well have rain tomorrow
 Do you know there are a lot of people like that
said George
I met an old woman up near our farm one summer who always said when anybody asked her how she was that she enjoyed poor health
And I guess she did
I never knew any one who took such pride in her aches and pains as she did
One day when the doctor had been to see her she had told him all the pains she suffered and the poor old doctor had to sit there and listen to her for almost an hour
Finally when he left she started out of the house after him calling to him to come back because she had just thought of another ache that she hadnt told him about
The boys laughed and silence for a time rested upon the little boat
The Black Growler was moving swiftly and still was attracting attention from every boat she met
Following the channel they kept well out in the river but the towering hills and the attractive shores were all within sight and manifestly did much to impress the Go Ahead boys
Tell me Fred spoke up John at last
Do they have these races on the St Lawrence every summer
They have had for the past few years and they have had water sports too
What do you mean
Oh they have swimming tilting contests canoe races diving and I dont know what all
Did you ever go in any of them
inquired John
A solemn expression came over Freds face as he said Yes once
What did you go into
I tried to walk the greased pole
There was a silver cup on the end of it and the fellow who could walk out and take it could claim it
Did you get the cup
I did not replied Fred shortly
Im surprised Peewee
I dont know a fellow in all my acquaintance that I think could walk better on a greased pole than you
Huh muttered Fred
You ought to have seen me
That pole was a part of a telegraph pole
It stuck out from the dock about fifteen feet
It was covered with grease and the grease had been rubbed in
How many times were you allowed to try
asked George
Five
And you couldnt go in five trials
I didnt go
The first time I stepped on the pole my feet flew out from under me and I sat down on the river about six or seven feet below
I sat down hard too
Did you enjoy it
laughed John
I did not replied Fred slowly but the people on the docks and along the banks seemed to have a fine time
What did you do next
laughed George
I tied some old sacking on my feet and tried to wipe up the grease as I went along 
And didnt that work
Nay verily it didnt work
I took my seat that time on the pole and then when I slipped I tried to throw my arms around it
But for some good reason I didnt delay very long before I dropped with a splash into the St
Lawrence
I hope they will have those things this summer spoke up John
You would be a good one to walk on a greased pole said George soberly
You wouldnt take much space and if you could once get a footing you could reach forward almost to the end and grab the cup
If I did retorted John you can rest easy that I wouldnt let go of it
How soon do we come to West Point
inquired Grant
In about an hour answered Fred
Do you know I sometimes think I should like to go there said George
Couldnt be done my son spoke up John
Why cant it be done
Because a fellow that enters West Point has to pass an examination
Dont you think I could pass it
demanded George as his friends laughed
It depends on what it is answered John
If they would examine you about the old Meeker House and running tin tubes from the kitchen into the front room and a few other things like that maybe you would pass
4 4 See The Go Ahead Boys and the Mysterious Old House
Thats all right spoke up George promptly
I know something about what a fellow has to do before he passes the West Point examinations anyway and thats more than some fellows I know can say
What do you know that we dont
inquired John
How old does a fellow have to be to enter West Point
demanded George
I dont know replied John somewhat foolishly
I suppose he has to be about eighteen at least I suppose a fellow eighteen could enter
Could he enter if he was twentyone
inquired George
He could spoke up Grant
A fellow has to be between seventeen and twentytwo years of age before he can take the preliminary examinations
But theres another qualification almost as necessary he added
He has got to be free from infirmities
No hope for Pop then said John solemnly
He has too many infirmities
What for example
demanded George
His appetite is abnormal his confidence in himself colossal his willingness to condescend to the level of his superiors is Youre getting all mixed up interrupted George
A fellow has to pass a good physical examination and that is all there is to it
Of course if he has too long a tongue or too small a head it might shut him out
Of course assented John
How does a fellow get a chance to try the examination anyway
He has to be named by his congressman
Most of them I guess have a preliminary examination for all the boys that want to enter and then select the one who passes the best examination
But even if he passes his troubles have only begun for they make every fellow work his way
The government appropriates some money for every cadet doesnt it
inquired John
Yes replied George 70950 per year
That is supposed to cover the necessary expenses
It is not only hard work but the boys dont get but one leave of absence in all the course and even that isnt given until after the first two years
But they have vacations dont they
inquired John
If you want to call them vacations laughed Grant
From about the middle of June to the end of August the cadets go into camp
They are busy every day
What does a fellow have to pass an examination in in order to enter West Point
English grammar English composition algebra through quadratic equations plane geometry descriptive geography physical geography United States history and the outlines of general history
I think Ill go if thats all laughed John who was well known to have troubles with most of his examinations in school
Look at that boat over yonder
suddenly interrupted Fred pointing to a motorboat about one hundred feet away
It looks to me as if it was trying to pass us
Thats just what it is trying to do said Grant eagerly
Dont you let them do it Peewee
Thats just what I intend not to do said Fred resolutely
In a moment the speed of the Black Growler was increased but it was also manifest as the boys glanced behind them that the boat they had noticed was in swift pursuit
CHAPTER III JOHN DISAPPEARS The rival boat was distant about one hundred feet moving in a line nearly parallel with that which the Black Growler was following
I believe I have seen that boat before muttered Fred
Can any of you fellows make out the name
George hastily took the fieldglasses and gazed earnestly at the swiftly moving boat
I can make out some of the letters Fred he said slowly
I can see Var the next letter looks like n Whats that
demanded Fred abruptly
I cant make out the whole of it yet answered George
I dont see what Varn spells anyway
You better look again suggested Fred
I think I know the boat
I guess its the Varmint
Thats it said George quickly
Only theres something right after the word
I cant just see what that is
Here let me take those glasses said Grant quickly
I dont believe you can find anything
Your mother told me that she doesnt want any better evidence that your clothes are hanging in the right places in the closet than for you to say that you had looked for them and they arent there
Listen to the words of our modest friend said George as he handed the glasses to his comrade
Grant is a good boy
The only difficulty with him is he doesnt realize how good he is
If he doesnt spoke up John it isnt because he doesnt try
Keep still fellows said Grant waving his hand at the other Go Ahead boys
Im just about to find out what the name of that motorboat that is beating us  Beating us nothing
interrupted Fred
Cant you see that she isnt gaining a foot
I cant even see her name yet said Grant
You had better slow up a bit Pygmy
That will give you a good excuse
In response Fred increased the power of the fast moving motorboat
I have it
I have it called Grant exultantly a moment later
It is Varmint II
It is what
demanded Fred quickly as he glanced behind him for a moment
Varmint II thats what it is said Grant positively
What do you know about that
Fred was silent a moment before he replied
Two years ago when I was visiting at my grandfathers I saw the Varmint run away from all the boats in the race
This must be a new one and if shes swifter than the other one then there will be some race let me tell you
Im going to try her out a little now
In accordance with his words Fred changed the course which the Black Growler was following until he was nearer the rival boat
It was plain now that the crew of the Varmint II were deeply interested in the Black Growler
They were watching her movements and eagerly talking to the man at the wheel
For several minutes the race continued and then abruptly the Varmint II shut off part of her power and speedily dropped behind
I told you what would happen said Fred exultantly
I would like to run away from that boat in a race
There isnt a boat on the St Lawrence I would like better to beat
But you dont even know she is going to be on the St Lawrence or in that race suggested John
Thats right
Thats right said Fred dolefully
Theres always somebody taking the joy out of life
You mark my words that boat is going to the St Lawrence and well find her in the race when we leave the stake
I hope so said Grant
It will be a great race if shes in it
But honestly Fred if you knew a little more about steering a boat I think you could win from her
How would it do for you to get somebody to steer the day of the race
Thats right spoke up George quickly
All the Black Growler needs is a pilot
Thatismostcertainly true said John slowly winking at Grant as he spoke
Huh spoke up Fred
Its a pity there isnt enough gray matter somewhere in this crowd to spell me at the wheel
I have run all the way from New York and Im tired and yet there isnt a fellow here who is able to steer this boat
Beg your pardon said John
Ill steer her with great gladness
I dont doubt your gladness  said Fred
What Im afraid of is your ability
If it was Grant now steering and we struck a rock he would never own up that that wasnt the very place he was steering for
However String take hold here awhile and give me a rest
Where are we going to stop for dinner
inquired George
This mad race has brought on an attack of hunger with me
Thats all right laughed Fred
I think the only thing you can say is that you are less hungry some times than others
We can stop anywhere you want
Then I say we stop at Poughkeepsie said Grant
Poughkeepsie will do for me all right said John soberly
A halfhour later the graceful little motorboat was lying alongside a dock at Poughkeepsie
Two of the boys had remained on board to guard their possessions while two had gone to a restaurant to purchase a luncheon with which they were to return to the boat
John and George had volunteered their services for the latter purpose and about fifteen minutes after their departure George was seen returning to the dock his arms well laden with packages of fruit and sandwiches
Wheres String
Fred asked as his friend stepped on board and deposited his packages
I dont know
I lost him up here
Poor John
Lost in Poughkeepsie
Im afraid well have to advertise
Theres one thing we wont do though said Grant
Whats that
inquired Fred
We shant wait for him to come before we begin operations
It does my heart good to hear you speak so truthfully said George as at once he opened the packages and passed the various articles of food which he had obtained
So busily engaged were the boys that time passed rapidly and a halfhour later George said What do you suppose has become of that fellow
I told you that his mother said that he was worse than I am and couldnt find any of his belongings but I didnt know that he would lose himself
Have you ever been in Poughkeepsie
inquired Grant soberly
I have never stopped here
Then I have no need for other explanations
I know what has become of John
Then youll be the one to go and get him
I guess not laughed Fred
No if he doesnt show up within fifteen minutes the Black Growler proceeds gracefully on its way and leaves little Johnnie to come after us
Maybe he can work his way by driving mules for a canal boat
There isnt any canal here said Fred
Well well leave it to him to settle the way he will come
We shant wait for him
Whos captain of this ship anyway
spoke up Fred
Thats the question that has often puzzled me too said Grant soberly
Well I am said Fred
You are
Then let me tell you Captain Peewee you will have a mutiny on your hands before you know it
This boat is going on to Albany
We have got to get there tonight and if John doesnt care enough about going with us he will have to take the consequences
Do you know I think he may have lost his nerve and gone back home
Dont you believe it said Fred sharply
John will be here in a few minutes
He never will lose his nerve
Fifteen minutes however elapsed and still the absent member of the Go Ahead boys did not return
When fifteen more minutes had passed Fred who had insisted that some investigation should be made and a search for John begun was overruled by his two companions and in spite of the captains protests the Black Growler slipped quickly away from the dock and proceeded steadily on her way up the Hudson
There were no mishaps although twice Fred stopped to secure fresh supplies of gasoline
No trace of the Varmint II had been seen and if she too was headed for the far away St Lawrence there was nothing to indicate the fact
And yet Fred became more positive with the passing minutes that among his rivals in the race in which his own swift motorboat was already entered would be found the boat whose pursuit he had found it so difficult to shake off
The boys by the middle of the afternoon were tired
There was no opportunity for exercise and in spite of the beauty of the region through which they were passing there was a certain monotony in their voyage which at last became wearisome
The sun was sinking low in the western sky when Fred at last said I think well make Albany in about an hour
Do you think well find String there
inquired George
I hope so
If it was any other of the Go Ahead boys I would say we would be sure to find him there but no one knows what Jack will do
The only certain thing about him is his uncertainty
Dont you remember Im telling you interrupted Grant that well find John waiting for us at the dock
He knows where were going to land
If String is there Ill agree to pay for the dinner tonight said George
My own feeling is that he hasnt left Poughkeepsie yet
It was still light when at last the Black Growler approached the dock where she was to be tied up for the night
The three Go Ahead boys were peering ahead of them with interest every one looking among the men on the docks for their missing companion
CHAPTER IV THE LOST IS FOUND He isnt there exclaimed George gleefully
Im safe on my dinner
I believe you are right said Fred in a low voice after he had glanced along the docks several times searching for his missing friend
Of course Im right said George
I am always right
Thats the reason why your fond parents wanted me to go with you on this trip
Somebody has to go along who understands modern life so I reluctantly gave up my own convenience and came along to look after these poor benighted Go Ahead boys
Keep quiet a minute George said Grant we all appreciate your kindness
Just now however I would rather see String than hear you
Not seeing String you must listen to me laughed George again
Let me see I dont buy the dinner and it seems to me that one or the other of my friends agreed to provide one if I was mistaken about John
No such agreement was made declared Fred sharply
Is that so Grant
demanded George turning to the remaining member of the party
It certainly is declared Grant
You were the only one to make the offer
Then I suppose I shall have to put up with it said George disconsolately
Now as soon as we get everything shipshape we had better go up to the hotel
Shall we take our bags or send down for them
inquired Grant
If we dont take them some one else will said Fred quickly
We can lock up everything else but we dont want to leave anything on board that can be taken away
Just as you say said Grant as taking his bag in his hand he stepped quickly to the dock
Already a small assembly had gathered and was commenting upon the beauty of the little motorboat
The pride of Fred had been satisfied so many times throughout the day that he was not unduly moved now by the words which he overheard
In a brief time he and his two companions were walking up State Street and soon secured rooms for the night in their hotel
An hour later when they entered the diningroom they were amazed to behold their missing friend John seated at a small table at which there were three places besides the one he had taken
For a moment the three Go Ahead boys stopped and gazed in amazement at him and then without a word being spoken all three silently advanced to the table which he had reserved and apparently without recognizing the presence of their friend at once seated themselves
Why dont you say something
demanded John a grin appearing on his face as he spoke
Im going to say something in a minute said George
I want to read through this program first to find out what Im to have for my dinner
 Program is a good word said Grant soberly
When George has such a chance to get a square meal he always has a regular program mapped out
Thats all right retorted George without glancing up from the menu card
Why dont you say something
demanded John again
My friend said Grant soberly gazing a moment at John as he spoke words are not adequate to express our feeling
How is it with you
Im fine said John
Why dont you ask me where I have been and how I came to Albany
Youre in Albany and that is enough to satisfy all the curiosity we have said Grant
It doesnt satisfy me said John
When three fellows run away from you and leave you high and dry in a city like Poughkeepsie why all I can say is that Thats enough to say Johnnie
That will do interrupted George waving his right hand at his friend
You are simply mistaken said John the grin appearing on his face once more
I want to tell you that whether you want it or not you are going to hear from me and in more ways than one
 Threatened people live long  spoke up Fred
At the same time String youll have to own up that we waited for you as long as we thought we could before we started for Albany
I didnt want to be out after dark in the Black Growler
I appreciate all your kind feelings laughed John
Now I want you to sympathize with me
I had gone to half a dozen different places doing my best to select certain good things for our luncheon
I had a choice assortment too let me tell you
Why Pops eyes would have popped out if he had seen what I had obtained but alas when I came down to the dock I saw the Growler running up the river as if she was trying to get away from me
Did you come up by train
inquired Fred
I did not come up by train retorted John speaking deliberately
How did you come
asked George interested now in spite of his effort to appear indifferent
Didnt you see the aeroplane
asked John
Aeroplane
No we didnt see any said Grant quickly
Well I didnt either said John so thats one way that I didnt come
Oh leave him alone said George he is just bursting with his story
He wants to tell us and we shant be able to stop him so lets have our dinner and you may rest easy that before we are done youll know all of Johns story and some beside
Tomorrow it will grow big and fast
Its like the pumpkins out in South Dakota
They say that a man has to be on horseback when he plants them
Hows that
laughed John
Why the vines grow so fast that the only way he can escape is to put his horse into his best paces
Even then they dont always escape
What happens if they are overtaken
asked John
Oh the pumpkin vines grow right around them and cover them up and choke off their wind and do other various stunts
Fine
Fine laughed John My story isnt growing like that though let me tell you
This story is true
Its a complete narrative of truthful John
I was about to turn back and make inquiries when I could get an express train for Albany when what should I see coming up to the dock but the Varmint II
As soon as the people on board saw me they immediately began to urge me to come with them
They had seen the Growler just pulling out and leaving me in my unfortunate plight
I guess they suspected what you had in the basket laughed Fred
That may be acknowledged John
At all events it saved them buying a good spread for they took me on board right away and we trailed you all the way up the Hudson
I tell you Peewee its a comfort to ride in a good boat
That Varmint II can travel
Oh I dont know how many knots an hour
Can she beat the Black Growler
inquired Fred anxiously
Beat her
Beat her
retorted John
Why you would think the Black Growler was standing still the Varmint can pull away from her so fast
I dont believe that said Fred shaking his head
Well you will have to for they are going to the same place we are
They have entered her in the motorboat races and as she belongs to the same class that your tub does you will have a fine chance to see her win the cup
Thats about the only chance youll have too in my opinion
John winked at George and Grant who immediately in doleful tones expressed their sympathy for Fred
Its too bad declared George after a fellows father has given him a boat such as the Black Growler to find out that it doesnt stand any show in the race
Now if you had found that out before you had bought the boat Fred just think how much money time labor trouble perplexity sleeplessness loss of appetite Never that broke in Grant shaking his head
All the other things yes but loss of appetite never
Just look at him
John insisted upon relating his experiences and increased the interest of his friends in spite of their efforts to appear indifferent when he said there were three young people on board the Varmint who were expecting to spend the summer on an island near Freds grandfathers and were also confident that the boat race was to be the supreme event of the summer
In spite of his declaration that he was not anxious it was plain to his friends that Fred was somewhat cast down by the glowing reports which his companion had brought concerning the swift rival motorboat
Tomorrow well be on the ragin canawl said Grant
Now then I want to know if there is any fellow in this crowd who knows anything about the worlds great canals
We dont know anything said Fred
We heard you talking this morning but how much of what you said is true nobody knows not even yourself
Its all true retorted Grant
As I told you I wasnt willing to start on a trip like this without knowing something about what I was doing
When do you start on that new line
laughed George
It doesnt make any difference said Grant
Now the Panama Canal for example belongs to the United States doesnt it
It does acknowledged Fred
Well now as a future citizen of this country just tell me between what places that canal extends
If there is one fellow in this crowd who can give me the right answer I will pay for the dinner for all the Go Ahead boys
Panama said John promptly
Panama what
retorted Grant sharply
Why the Panama Canal is located at the City of Panama said John somewhat abashed by the manner of his friend
Thats good as far as it goes said Grant but I want to know if you know where the other end of the canal is located
The three boys looked blankly at one another and for an instant no one spoke
The canal extends between Colon and the City of Panama said Grant hastily
Thats exactly what I was going to say said George
You took the words right out of my mouth
You did it so that you wouldnt have to pay for the dinner tomorrow
I guess every one of us knows where the Panama Canal is
All right said Grant
Ill take your word for it if youll tell me how long it is
Again there was silence among the Go Ahead boys as they glanced foolishly at one another
Of course every young American is sure to know such simple facts as that said Grant condescendingly but for my own satisfaction I am willing to state that it is exactly fifty and onehalf miles long
How deep is it
said Fred sharply
It is about fortyone feet answered Grant promptly
Of course in the lakes it is deeper than that and it is from three hundred to six hundred and fortynine feet wide
Why I dont believe he continued that some American boys I happen to know although they passed right through it could tell me how long the Sault Ste
Marie Canal is
I have a dim suspicion too that they dont know what it connects
I know that said George
It connects Lake Superior with St Marys River and Lake Huron
Im glad youre right once in your life said Grant
Now tell me how long that canal is
I cant tell a lie Mr Schoolmaster said George the Sault Ste
Marie Canal is two miles long
All right I dont have to buy the dinner tomorrow said Grant
There may be some other things youll have to do though said John
Youre not done with me yet
No sir he added emphatically that is NOT all
CHAPTER V THE MISSING BAG Early the following morning the Go Ahead boys were moving swiftly over the waters of the Erie Canal
Most of the country through which they were passing was new to them and rested as they were from the voyage of the preceding day they were deeply interested in the various scenes through which they were moving
The speedy Growler still aroused the interest of the people who saw the graceful little boat
The speed at which Fred was driving was not as great as when they had been on the Hudson
The stream was narrower and frequently there were long canalboats to be passed
The experiences when they arrived at the locks were alike novel and filled with interest
After they had watched the slowly rising waters and several times had been lifted to a different level the novelty however wore off and by the middle of the forenoon the Go Ahead boys were beginning to tease one another
Theres one thing said John thats as fixed as the sun
Nobody made any response to his startling suggestion and after he had glanced quizzically at his companions John continued No crowd ever left a fellow at Poughkeepsie and went on without him without having to pay the price
Im telling you fellows that just as sure as the sun shines theres something coming to every one of you and most of all to Grant
Why am I selected for this special favor
demanded Grant quickly
If you dont know there isnt any one who can tell you retorted John
All Im saying is that action and reaction are equal even if the Panama Canal is fifty and onehalf miles long
Speaking of canals said Grant
I want to know if anybody knows how long the Suez Canal is
Speak up Professor said George dejectedly
We have got to hear it so we might as well have it now as any time
How long is it
Its exactly one hundred miles
Now if theres any Go Ahead boy who can tell what the Suez Canal connects it will be my turn to pay for the dinner
There was a silence following Grants words while the Go Ahead boys looked foolishly at one another
Not one of them was able to answer the simple question
The Suez Canal began Grant connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea
How do you know
demanded Fred
You have never seen it
I dont have to see it to know
I have never seen London but I am quite confident there is a city by that name
By the way fellows if youll wait a minute Ill show you something I put in my bag
I saved it for a day just like this
Rising from his seat Grant hastily sought his bag and in a brief time rejoined his companions
Whats the matter
demanded John as he saw an expression of consternation on the face of his friend
Matter
retorted Grant
Matter enough
Somebody brought the wrong bag
Let me see said John rising and examining the bag which Grant had placed on the seat near him
Thats not mine
It surely isnt mine said George
I wont claim it either added Fred as he glanced behind him
Well it isnt mine said Grant
Somebody made a mistake at the hotel this morning and instead of giving me what belonged to me they have sent my bag off in some other direction and given me a bag that belongs to some one else
Try your keys suggested John
Maybe it isnt as bad as you think
The keys dont fit declared Grant after he had tested them all
Maybe theres a catch or a trick of some kind
Look again Soc and see if there isnt some way to find out what there is inside that bag
Thats about the only way you can tell whose it is
I have been trying retorted Grant sharply
Its locked and I havent any key that will fit it
It feels pretty heavy said John as he lifted the bag in question
Yes its heavier than mine acknowledged Grant
I dont see how that porter could have made any such mistake
I dont see any way out of it Soc but for you to take your bag back to Albany said Fred
Im not going back declared Grant
Ill send the bag back by express and telegraph the hotel to send my bag in the same way to Utica
If they get busy right away it ought to be there by the time we are
No use my dear friend said John shaking his head
Your bag by this time is on its way to Timbuctoo or San Francisco
Some other fellow has it and if he has and isnt making remarks that sound like echoes of yours it is only because he hasnt yet found out his mistake
The perplexity in which Grant found himself was increasing
Many of his necessary articles and much of his clothing that he would require on the trip were contained in the missing bag
He was unable to see the sly wink which John gave Fred when the latter looked questioningly at him
So insistent was Grant that the Black Growler was stopped at Schenectady to enable him to send a telegram to the hotel at which the Go Ahead boys had stopped the preceding night at Albany
No one had offered to assist him in his task and the boy alone carried the bag which he believed had been given him in place of his own to the express office
There in accordance with the word which he had already sent the hotel he shipped the bag to Albany
When he returned to the motorboat so engrossed was he with his own troubles that he failed to discover the grin which appeared on the faces of two of the Go Ahead boys
You might have offered to go back to get my bag suggested Grant sharply when he resumed his seat on board
Yes we might said Fred
We might have offered to buy a new one for you and fit it out with all the things you need but we thought we wouldnt
You need the lesson Soc
You have been telling all the world how to do it so long that it is time for you to begin to find out some things for yourself
Grant made no reply and indeed he had little to say until the boat stopped at an attractive village where the boys obtained their luncheon
When the voyage was resumed Grants confidence that his own missing bag would be found when they arrived at Utica in a measure served to restore his good nature and throughout the afternoon he took an active part in the bantering in which the boys engaged
Occasionally Fred relinquished his task at the wheel and permitted his friends to take turns in steering the boat
The banks of the canal were free from rocks and even if the swift little motorboat was turned from her course no great amount of damage could follow
There were other boats they were informed that had preceded them and among them the references to the swift Varmint II were frequent
On such occasions Freds passengers at once resumed their task of informing their captain how small his chances of winning the race were becoming
Apparently the Varmint had everything her own way
Fred did his utmost to appear indifferent to the words of his companions but in spite of it all it became plain to the other boys that he was seriously disturbed by the comments they made
There were times when the course being clear the speed of the Black Growler was increased almost to her maximum
At such times the farmers in the fields stopped in their labors and stared at the motorboat which almost seemed to be shooting through the country
At other times when they were passing through villages or met a heavily laden canalboat the Black Growler moved slowly and seemed to share in the need of caution
It was late in the afternoon when at last the little party arrived at Utica
Well go up to the hotel and have our dinner said Grant
I do not know that I owe the rest of you anything but Im going to take pity on you and do what I at first thought I wouldnt
Im going to give you a dinner
Thats very kind said John winking at Fred as he spoke
Meanwhile whos going to look after our bags
Im going to find out first if mine is here to be looked after said Grant
Come on with me Jack and Ill go to the express offices and see if it is there
John followed his friend but their labors were not crowned with success when after an absence of an hour they returned to the place where the Black Growler was awaiting them
Not a word had been received from Albany nor had Grant succeeded in finding any trace of his missing baggage
Never mind he said quickly
Ill have to make the best of it
Im not going to spoil all the fun of the trip crying over spilled milk
Again John winked at Fred but no words were spoken after the boat and its belongings had been left in charge of a man and the boys together had started for their hotel
It was still light when they returned to the dock and Fred said I wonder how it would do for us to go on a bit farther
There are hotels all along the way and I think it would be good fun to stop at some one of those country taverns
Were with you said George
We want to get all the experiences we can on this trip
I guess it will be something you will remember said Grant
CHAPTER VI IN THE TAVERN About halfpast eight o clock the Go Ahead boys returned to the dock where the Black Growler had been left
A hasty examination convinced them that all their belongings were safe
In accordance with the suggestion which had been made they soon decided to set forth on their voyage
Just how far they would go was left undecided
I hear said Fred that we can stop at a village halfway between here and Rome
They say it is all right
If we dont like to sail in the night then we can stop there but if we want to we can keep on until we get to Rome or Oneida
Thats about as far as well want to go anyway
I think it will be good fun said John to travel through the country by night
Perhaps well find some more places like the old Meeker House
5 5 The Go Ahead Boys and the Mysterious Old House
Im afraid laughed George that well find our ghosts a little more substantial than they were in that old place
I wish we could find my bag spoke up Grant
Its strange it didnt come to Utica
I left word with the express office though to send it ahead just as soon as they received it
Maybe well find the ghost of it suggested Fred
Meanwhile they had cast off and the Black Growler was moving noiselessly over the waters of the Erie Canal
They were soon beyond the borders of the attractive city but after they had passed the first village on their way George said quickly Fellows I believe its going to rain
Look at those clouds over yonder
As he spoke George pointed to some heavy clouds that could be seen massing in the western sky
I dont want to get caught out here in a thunder storm said John
We shant be said Fred
Ill put on a little more speed and well go on to the next place
Thats where the hotel or tavern is that they told me about in Utica
It wont rain before we get there for it is only four or five miles ahead
If it is going to rain we can stop
If it doesnt we can keep on if we want to
Conversation ceased as the speed of the swift little boat increased
Less than a halfhour had elapsed when the boys found that they were entering the village to which Fred had referred
How about it Fred
called John
It looks pretty black to me
It does to me too replied Fred
I think the best thing for us to do will be to stop
Well find a place where we can leave the motorboat and then well go up to the hotel and if we have to well stay there all night
The boys all agreed to the suggestion and in a brief time the graceful little boat was covered in such a way that she was protected from the coming storm which now was almost upon them
Hastily the boys took their bags and at once started for the hotel which they were informed was only a few yards distant
With difficulty they made their way along the darkened street and in a few minutes arrived at their destination
Just as they entered the storm broke
There was a long roll of thunder followed by a blinding flash and then the rain began to fall in torrents
Just in time werent we
said Fred with a laugh
Youre always right if you do what I tell you to
It was my suggestion and I am glad that for once in your lives you had wisdom enough to do what I said
That remains to be seen said Grant dryly as he looked about the room in which they found themselves
It seems to me that the motto over the door of this place ought to be He who enters here leaves soap behind
 Where did you find that
laughed George
Didnt you ever hear of the motto over the Bridge of Sighs
Whether the boys had ever heard of the famous bridge or not was not manifest for at that moment in the midst of a deafening peal of thunder the landlady entered the room where the boys were waiting
What can I do for you
she inquired as the thunder ceased
Were caught in the storm and thought perhaps we might stay here all night suggested Fred
The house is pretty full said the woman dubiously
I dont know whether I can give you rooms or not
At that moment there came a burst of loud laughter from the barroom
It was plain that many of the men who were employed on the canal also had sought shelter in the little tavern
The house was old so old that the boards in the floor were warped and the low ceilings gave evidence of the many years that had passed since they had been placed there
Not a door fitted its frame and the windows were all small the panes being not much more than seven by nine
Whatever was done in one part of the house plainly was likely to be known also in other parts
The noisy men who were drinking in the barroom whose shouts and songs and cries now were even more distinctly heard could not confine their loud demonstrations to the room in which they had assembled even if they had been so inclined
If you dont mind suggested Fred to the landlady I think we would like to go up to our rooms
Have you had any supper
inquired the woman
Yes we got some in Utica replied Fred
Where are you goin
We expect to go to the St Lawrence River
You dont tell me exclaimed the woman
How be you goin
We have got a motorboat
Land sakes
You dont say so
Thats a terrible long ways and I dont see how you can get there with a boat all the way
The storm caught us and we thought we had better stop here for the night than try to go on any farther
Where do you come from
inquired the woman who busied herself lighting two candles while she was talking
We came from Albany this morning replied Fred who did not think it necessary to go more into details concerning their expedition
My you must have come pretty fast
Now if youll follow me Ill show you to your rooms
Fred glanced uneasily behind him as from the barroom at that moment there came another noisy outburst that was almost alarming in its character
How many men are there in there
inquired Fred nodding his head toward the room as he spoke
Its about full replied the landlady
A stormy night like this drives a good many of the boatmen and the hands under cover
They are a noisy lot suggested Fred
They are a tough crowd said the woman feelingly
Sometimes they go off and dont pay me a cent
Thats one reason why I make everybody pay before I give them a room
Do you mean that well have to pay before we take the room
inquired John
Yes sir thats just what I say
Thats the rule o this house
Well I guess well see the rooms first then said George
Conversation ceased as the woman who was stout and consequently slow in her movements led the way up the creaking stairway and then through the hall on the second floor
The floor here also was loose and every step was announced by creakings while various other sounds were emitted as the boards resumed their accustomed places
Here you be said the woman at last as she stopped before the rooms at the end of the hallway
Were directly over the barroom arent we
inquired John as another noisy outburst came from below
Yes but you wont mind that after a bit explained the landlady
Youll get used to it same as I have
I go to sleep and dont pay no more attention to the noises than I do to the wind that blows
By this time she had opened the doors which were unlocked and entered the rooms
The boys looked ruefully at one another when they became aware in the dim light of the condition of the rooms to which they had been shown
I dont believe those windows have seen soap and water since the Erie Canal was built whispered George to Grant
When did you say that was
Keep quiet a minute Pop retorted Grant
The rain was beating against the windows with renewed force
The storm apparently was at its height
For them to go on in the Black Growler was almost impossible
There was nothing to be done except to make the best of the conditions in which they now found themselves
Soon after the withdrawal of their landlady who had been paid in advance for the use of the rooms although breakfast was not included as the boys explained they might have to leave the village before sunrise they prepared for bed
They were thoroughly tired by the new experiences of the past day and in spite of their surroundings and the noise of the men below and of the storm which still was raging they decided to retire
Their rooms did not connect and as George and Grant withdrew Fred said If we need your help in the night fellows dont fail to come right away
Are you scared Peewee
laughed George
Yes I am and I dont mind saying so retorted Fred
I dont like the sound that comes from that room downstairs
Freds feelings were not relieved when he found it was impossible to lock the doors
An old fashioned iron latch was the only means by which each door was opened and there were not even bolts or buttons by which the door could be fastened
Im going to put a chair against the door said Fred
Im afraid something will happen before morning
Nor was Fred disappointed for two hours after the boys were in bed the door of the room which Fred and John occupied was stealthily opened by some one in the hall
CHAPTER VII AN UNWELCOME PARTY Whos there
Whos there
demanded Fred sharply
The noise in the room below had prevented him from sleeping soundly
Several times he sat erect in bed convinced that some one was in the room
Even when his fears proved to be groundless he was unable to ignore the shouts and songs and calls that frequently indicated that the men in the room below were angry
Before he had retired he had obtained a glimpse of the shouting assembly when a door had been opened and the sight had not soothed his feelings
And now he was positive some one was trying to open the door of their room
Aroused by the call of his friend John also quickly sat up and stared about him
There was no mistaking the fact that some one was trying to enter by the door which yielded slightly to the pressure and the chair which had been placed by Fred to protect them had been moved back a few inches from its place
Whos there
Whos there
demanded Fred sharply
No reply was given to his question although the door slowly was closed again and the sound of the footsteps of some one moving down the hall was plainly heard
What do you suppose that was
demanded Fred in a whisper
Somebody was trying to break in replied John
What do you suppose he wanted
He wanted to get in
What for
I dont know
Youll have to ask him I guess replied John drowsily for by this time he had resumed his place on the pillow
I think he wanted our money suggested Fred
He didnt want much then
Maybe he wanted our money and our lives
All the same Im scared
I dont like this place
I dont know why we stopped here
It must be past one oclock now and yet hear those men yell down there in the barroom
Im going to see what time it is
Fred climbed out of bed and striking a match looked at his watch
Its quarter past one he said but the sound which came from John did not indicate that he was specially interested in the report of the watch
Fred looked out of the window and saw that the storm long since had passed
The air was cool and fresh and had it not been for the uproar in the hotel the night would have been an ideal one
Before he rejoined his companion Fred replaced the chair so that it barred the opening of the door
Convinced that he had done all in his power he climbed back into bed once more and in spite of his declaration when daylight came that he had not been asleep John was not convinced
Come on String said Fred when once more he had looked at his watch to discover the time
Its five oclock
Its time for us to be moving
I wouldnt have breakfast in this hole if they paid me for it
Why cant you leave a fellow alone and let him sleep
Im tired
I got left at Poughkeepsie and I had a hard day yesterday too
No sir said Fred firmly
This party starts from this place in thirty minutes
Any one who isnt ready will have to come by canalboat
The Black Growler leaves here at fivethirty sharp
With a groan John arose and began to dress although he protested feelingly all the time against the unreasonable demands of Fred
The other two Go Ahead boys were speedily aroused and twenty minutes later they departed from the hotel
It looks worse in the morning than it does at night and we thought that wasnt possible when we came here last evening said George when the Go Ahead boys looked behind them after their departure
I think I will send that landlady a Christmas present of a cake of soap said Grant soberly
She wouldnt know what it was for laughed John if you did
My I would like to hear what my mother would say if she could see the inside of that old tavern
The worst thing of all said Fred was the riot in the barroom
I didnt sleep a wink last night
You didnt sound that way Freddie said George
What time did the noise downstairs stop Peewee
inquired John
It didnt stop I guess laughed Fred
The landlady said the storm drove all the canalmen into the house but it didnt seem to me there was anything that drove them out
I shouldnt like to meet one of those men in a dark alley
You dont have to meet them suggested George
We have lived through the night somehow and are all safe
Now if the Black Growler is ready we are
Well get our breakfast at Rome I suppose
Thats what we will said Fred quickening his pace as he spoke
Look yonder
exclaimed John abruptly halting as he spoke and pointing in surprise at their motorboat which was only a few yards distant
In response to his suggestion the Go Ahead boys all stopped and stared in amazement at the sight before them
On board the Black Growler were at least a halfdozen men and it required no explanation to enable the boys to understand that they were a part of the noisy assembly which had made night hideous in the hotel
Here called Fred running ahead of his companions
What are you doing in that boat
Who are you
demanded one of the occupants turning and facing Fred as he spoke
Thats my boat declared Fred
You dont say so
replied the man in shrill tones at which his companions laughed loudly
For a moment Fred stopped and stared blankly at the men who had apparently made themselves fully at home on board his motorboat
The awnings had been taken in and the selfinvited guests had been examining various parts of the fleet little craft
Did you ever hear continued the spokesman that possession is nine points of the law and that the tenth isnt worth fighting about
Maybe well ask you to prove that this boat is yours
According to the records of my private secretary this here yacht is mine
Im goin on a cruise up to Buffalo and I have invited a few o my pals to come along with me
The men were a brutal and powerful lot
Every one showed the effect of the night which he had spent in the barroom
The boys were powerless to compel them to leave the boat if they did not choose to do so
The predicament in which the Go Ahead boys now found themselves seemed to appeal strongly to the men on board
They laughed loudly and the leader who had spoken before said Why dont you come on board
If this boat is yours all you have to do is to come and take it
It is all right
That is our boat said Fred
If you dont get out I shall have to get some one to put you out
Dont be so unkind mister retorted the leader while his companions again united in a shout of glee
There arent many men around this place that will want to undertake that job
If you would really like to have us go ashore it seems to me the best plan would be for you to come and throw us out
Once more the unwelcome guests laughed loudly at the words of their leader while the confusion among the Go Ahead boys became more marked
Withdrawing a few feet from the bank Fred called his companions about him and in low tones they discussed the course of action which they ought to follow
We had better go up and get the constable suggested John
Get out a warrant for these men
They wont make any trouble even if the constable comes down alone
Im not so sure said Fred
What do you think Grant
I dont believe the men intend to stay on board replied Grant
They probably were attracted by the appearance of the Black Growler and when they saw us coming they put up a bold front and just tried to scare Fred
What do you think is the best thing to do
inquired Fred
My suggestion is to go back to the boat not have much to say to the men and get ready to start
They wont bother us at least I dont believe they will
What shall we do if they make trouble
It will be time enough to decide that when we have to replied Grant
Im sure they wont make any trouble after they see that we are going to start
All right well try it said Fred dubiously and once more returning to the place where the Black Growler was awaiting them the three bags which contained the belongings of the boys were placed on board and ignoring the bantering of the men they at once prepared to cast off
You dont mean to say were going to start now do you
inquired the leader
Yes said Fred shortly
Why we didnt think youd go for an hour yet
We havent got our trunks
Again his companions laughed loudly at the wit of their leader but as yet not one of them had made any move to leave the boat
Freds alarm was plain in spite of the boldness with which he cast off the bow line
Grant already had performed a similar service with the stern line and the boys were now ready to depart
Its nice of you to invite us to go along with you said the leader
This is a purty little boat and me and my pals will enjoy a ride in her
Were going to start now said Fred quietly striving to conceal his fear
Why I guess were ready arent we
said the leader as he glanced at his companions
I reckon we are capn replied one of the men
The six men occupied most of the available space on board the little boat
Striving to appear indifferent to their presence Fred advanced to the wheel turned on the power and prepared to depart
CHAPTER VIII THE COMING OF THE CALEDONIA In response to Freds action there was a loud shout of protest from the men on board
Every one still was manifesting the effect of the drunken spree through which they had passed the preceding night
As yet however they had not offered any violence and although Freds heart was beating rapidly he resolutely stuck to his task and in a brief time the Black Growler darted forward like a thing alive
For a moment the uninvited passengers apparently were startled by the unexpected action of the young captain
They speedily recovered however from their surprise and one of the men turning to the leader said My ain t she purty Jim
She is that replied Jim promptly
She looks better than she did when I took my last trip to Niagra
When I left my house on Fifth Avenoo I didnt think shed ever measure up to what she was that time but she is goin one better
Yes sir shes all that you say she is
Still the men did not interfere with Fred in his management of the motorboat
Apparently too they did not have any objection to the voyage
Indeed the Go Ahead boys already were aware of the fact that every one of their selfinvited guests had brought a small bundle with him
They naturally inferred that these bundles contained most of the earthly possessions of their noisy passengers
How is it Jim
called another of the men
Isnt it about time we had breakfast
Thats right spoke up another
Im hungry too
Seems to me I would like one o them grape fruits
Grape fruits
You dont know what they be retorted Jim
You tell us what they be responded the man unabashed by the rebuke of the leader
Dont you know
retorted Jim scornfully
Why grape fruits the stuff that grows on grape vines
Get out
said the other one
I guess I know enough about the country to know that grapes grow on grape vines
In course they do acknowledged Jim but this isnt grapes this is grape FRUIT
It takes a special vine to grow it
Does it grow right on the vine
In course it does
What do you think it grows under the ground like tomatoes
Tomatoes dont grow under the ground spoke up another of the party
Its potatoes that grow under the ground
Its all one retorted Jim glibly
Potatoes and tomatoes
I knew one grew in the air and the other grew in the ground
What about the grape fruits Jim
demanded the first speaker
Well they grow on the vines
They are just like big yeller grapes
Many s a time out on my country estate I have climbed the ladder and picked em from the vines that grow so high they hid the sight of the street from the piazzy of my bungaloo
Im wondering where you got this yacht Jim inquired another
Never mind how I got it as long as we have got it
Thats the main thing interrupted another one
What I want to know is about those grape fruits were talking about
How does it taste
Fine
Fine answered Jim promptly
Then turning to the boys he inquired Have you got anything on board to eat
You see that monemint up yonder interrupted another pointing to a tall granite shaft that could be seen in the distance
The entire party including the boys at once looked in the direction indicated and saw a beautiful memorial stone although few of them were aware of what it commemorated
Yes thats my granddads tombstone said one of the tramps
I guess he must have been some man exclaimed one of his companions
Its a pity the rest of the family didnt take after him
We did but we didnt want to hog the whole thing
We had to let some one else have a chance too
Meanwhile the Black Growler was speeding swiftly over the waters of the Erie Canal
Fred was driving at high speed and as the boat sped forward he was keenly watching for the coming of a boat that might provide help for the Go Ahead boys in their predicament
Several canalboats had been passed but there was no one on board who appeared to be able to help
The unwelcome guests still talked noisily to one another but in the main they ignored the boys and as yet had not offered any violence
Whos running this ere boat Jim
suddenly spoke up one of the passengers
I thought you said this was your yacht
I did say so answered Jim promptly
Im just taking out a pleasure party
Didnt you never go to no picnic afore
I want you to be good for we have got compny on board
When you have got guests you have to be perlite whether you want to be or not
Still the Black Growler was moving swiftly
The waters over which she was passing seethed and boiled as if they had been heated by unseen fires
Even Fred had lost a part of his alarm as he began to suspect that his uninvited passengers did not know how to manage the boat
If they did it was difficult to understand why they had not yet driven the boys away and taken charge
There was another thought in Freds mind that was perplexing
He suspected that the supply of gasoline was running low
He had neglected to have the tank filled the preceding night believing that he had a supply ample to carry them forward until they could obtain more
Suppose the motorboat should stop
What would the men do
They might accuse him of deliberately stopping and in that event he was aware that there might be serious trouble
Indeed he was still puzzled to understand why the men appeared to be so contented
If they had been workers on the canal or had been employed by any of the boats why was it that they were free this morning
He was aware that the little city of Rome could not be far away
If once he should be able to bring the Black Growler safely within the borders of the city he was confident he would be able to rid himself speedily of the men whose presence with every passing moment was becoming more difficult to bear
He looked eagerly ahead for signs of the city
He was unable to discover any however but his fears increased as he became more positive that his supply of gasoline was low
If only it would last a halfhour longer
On either side of the canal was a level stretch of country and near to the water no houses were to be seen
His friends had taken seats on the deck forward
In low tones they conversed among themselves but Fred was too busy in his own task either to heed what they were saying or to join in their conversation
A few minutes later after the speed of the boat had materially decreased Fred said abruptly We have got to stop
What for
demanded the leader quickly rising as he spoke and turning toward the young pilot
Our gasoline is gone
Look here young fellow said the leader of the gang after he had silently glared at Fred a moment I dont want you to try any of your games on us
Were bad men
Now then you keep this boat goin he added threateningly
I only wish I could do it said Fred
Are you givin us straight goods when you say your gasoline is gone
I am
What are you goin to do
Nothing
Thats the trouble
You cant do anything without gasoline
I am thinking of letting some of my passengers go ahead and get enough to carry us into the town
Do you know how far it is to Rome
Must be about three mile
That wouldnt be very much of a walk said Fred glibly
For some unexplained reason his courage now had returned and he stood in less fear of his rough and noisy guests
What are you goin to do
again demanded the leader
There isnt anything I can do retorted Fred sharply unless some of you will go ahead and get some gasoline
Thats right Jim spoke up one of his companions
Well go and get his gasoline
Tell him to give us four dollars and well get a good supply
Thats right spoke up Jim quickly
We cant get gasoline without some money
Oh one of us will go along and pay the bills spoke up John who up to this point had taken no part in the conversation
How much money you got
I guess we have got just enough to buy fifteen gallons of gasoline
All right then give it to us and well get the gasoline for you
I told you that we shant give you the money said John
Well go with you
Perhaps we can get a ride on a canalboat or something
You wont save much time that way retorted Jim
The only thing to do is to let us have the money and save yourselves a lot of trouble
Were not going to give you any money said John quietly
I told you that before
The thing for you to do is to clear out every one of you if you dont want to help
Unknown to his companions John had been keeping a careful outlook on the canal behind them
In the distance he had seen a yacht approaching that he was confident was the Caledonia which they had passed when first they had set forth on their voyage
He was confident also that the coming of the yacht together with the number of men that comprised her crew would be sufficient to overawe the halfdozen men that had forced their company upon the Go Ahead boys
Yonder comes the Caledonia
he exclaimed suddenly
They will give us a lift as soon as they catch up with us
Instantly the eyes of every one on board the Black Growler were turned toward the approaching yacht
Apparently the sight had markedly different effects
The Go Ahead boys were elated but their passengers after a hasty glance and a few words spoken in low tones to one another instantly seizing their bundles leaped ashore and ran swiftly toward the road which was not more than fifty yards distant
CHAPTER IN A FRIEND IN NEED In response to the signal of distress which Fred waved from the deck of the Black Growler as the Caledonia approached the speed of the big yacht was checked and she stopped not far from the motorboat
It was still early in the morning and the owners or guests on board the Caledonia were not seen on deck
Whats wrong
Whats the trouble
called the captain leaning over the rail and speaking to Fred
We have had trouble replied Fred
A gang of tramps or canal men forced themselves on board and we have just gotten rid of them
When they saw the Caledonia coming they all ran
Well if you have got rid of them said the captain gruffly what more do you want
If you go ahead they wont catch up with you
But we cant go ahead
Why not
Our gasoline is out
We dont run by gasoline said the captain and Im afraid steam wouldnt do you any good
Perhaps you might give us a tow as far as Rome
Perhaps we might and then Whats the trouble
Fred looked up quickly as he saw a man about fifty years of age approaching the rail and standing near the captain of the yacht
He wore a yachting cap and it was plain to the perplexed boy that he either was the owner of the beautiful boat or one whose word counted for much
We have had our troubles explained Fred once more
A gang of tramps forced their way on board our boat and they have just left us
Our gasoline is out and I was asking the captain if he would be willing to give us a tow as far as Rome
Of course he will said the man heartily
Have you got a painter long enough
Im afraid not replied Fred
Then well toss you a rope
The captain at once responded to the word of the man who had been speaking to Fred and in a brief time a rope was thrown on board the little motorboat
Are you all ready
called the man from the deck
Yes sir replied Fred heartily for by this time he and his friends had made the rope fast and were prepared to start
All right then captain go ahead
The Caledonia at once resumed her way and the Black Growler obediently followed about twentyfive feet behind the larger boat
Before they arrived at Rome other people in addition to the man who assisted the boys were seen on the deck of the Caledonia
It was evident that the party had not followed the example of the Go Ahead boys in spending any nights at hotels
They slept on board and the portholes of what undoubtedly were beautiful little cabins were plainly seen along the sides of the yacht
It was manifest too that the story of the misfortunes of the Go Ahead boys was speedily told for a party of five young people in addition to the older ones assembled in the stern of the Caledonia and laughingly greeted the boys in the boat that was being towed
A short time afterward the boats entered the little city of Rome
When they arrived at a place where a landing safely could be made Fred shouted to the people on the Caledonia Well cast off now
Thank you for all you have done
You have helped us out of a bad fix
Youre very welcome Im sure replied the man who had arranged for their relief from their predicament
Are you going down the St
Lawrence
he added
Yes sir replied Fred as far as Alexandria Bay
Then we may see you again called the man
We expect to be on an island near there
My name is Stevens
If you expect to be in Alexandria Bay very long dont fail to look us up
Thank you sir replied Fred and his companions were as interested as he in his word
We certainly shall do so
Thank you again for all that you have done to help us
The Caledonia quickly resumed her voyage while the boys waving their handkerchiefs in response to the tokens of good will that came from the strangers who had helped them speedily made their boat fast and went ashore
In response to their inquiries they were directed to a place where they could obtain a breakfast and not many minutes had elapsed before the four Go Ahead boys were seated about a table busily engaged in their repast
I tell you Im hungry said John as he called for a second piece of beefsteak
Thats the way you would be all the time said George if you would only get up early in the morning
That doesnt go
I was up all night long spoke up Fred
I didnt sleep any last night
I noticed that said Grant
The sound that came from your room showed very plainly that you were not sleeping and yet I cannot understand why a fellow should make all those noises if he is wide awake
It was John you heard retorted Fred
Yes I heard John too said Grant
It was a duet most of the time
Now arent you glad he added that I told you how wide the Erie Canal is
You see there was plenty of room for the Caledonia to pass us and take us in tow
How wide is the Erie Canal
spoke up George
I dont believe you can remember it now yourself
You havent your notes with you
None of that he added quickly as Grant felt in his pocket for a paper
Tell me on your word of honor how wide the Erie Canal is
Seventy feet wide on the surface and fiftysix feet wide at the bottom said Grant promptly
I suppose well have to take your word for it said George as his friends laughed at his discomfiture
We cant dispute you and even if you dont know anything about it you tell it as if you believed it to be the most solemn truth in the world
Its true just as Im telling you said Grant
How about the new canal that New York State is building now
I have told you about that too said Grant but then you have to have a good many review lessons with some people
Thats all right but just the same tell me about the new canal
How wide is it
Thats one hundred and twentythree to one hundred and seventyone feet wide on the surface and seventyfive feet wide at the bottom
Of course there are some places Grant added when it runs into a lake or a pond where it is a good deal wider than that
But as far as the digging is concerned thats the width
Is it deeper than the Erie Canal
Yes sir
The Erie Canal is about seven feet deep and the new one is about twelve feet deep
Its going to be deep enough to take in boats of three thousand tons
As soon as their breakfast had been eaten and a fresh supply of gasoline had been obtained once more in high spirits the boys started in their swift motorboat
Their experience with the canalmen now was only a memory and they could well afford to laugh at what had been said and done
Thats what you get for having us stop in a place such as you picked out Peewee said George
Theres no accounting for the tastes of some people
Now I never should have selected that place
You can believe me Ill never select it again answered Fred so soberly that his friends all laughed
Once is enough and forever
I didnt believe there could be such a place in the whole of New York State
Well you know now there is said John and so do the rest of us
We dont stop again without knowing something of the hotel in which we are to stay
Where shall we stay tonight fellows
inquired Fred
We ought to get to Syracuse early this afternoon and we can go right on to Oswego if you want to or we can stay there until tomorrow morning and start then
Wait and see what time it is when we strike Syracuse said Grant
Probably the gasoline you bought back there at Rome wont last until we get there
I have got enough gasoline to take us to the St Lawrence River declared Fred
Im not going to be caught again as I was this morning
Meanwhile the Black Growler was noisily speeding on her way
To three of the boys the country through which they were moving was all new and therefore abounded in interest
Prosperous villages and fertile farms were passed
As the sun climbed higher into the heavens the day became so much warmer that the boys were glad to seek the shelter behind the awnings which they now had made use of as a protection from the heat and glare
It was early in the afternoon when the Go Ahead boys arrived at the thriving city of Syracuse
They speedily decided to rest an hour after they had stopped for luncheon and then through the Oswego Canal to go on to the shore of Lake Ontario
There they would be ready to start on the following morning and were hopeful that if no mishaps occurred they would arrive at their destination the following afternoon
The clear air the quiet that rested over the region through which they were passing the tranquil attitude of even the cattle in the fields gave slight indication that the peacefulness of the scene was soon to be broken and the Go Ahead boys were to enter upon one of their most stirring experiences
CHAPTER X IN TROUBLE The Black Growler was not moving as swiftly as when she had been speeding over the waters of the Erie Canal
There was less need of haste now and the boys were more interested as they were drawing near the city which was to be the destination of their inland voyage
It was dusk when they arrived at Oswego
They made the little motorboat safe until the following morning and then with their belongings at once walked to the hotel where they were to pass the night
A hearty dinner soon revived the spirits of the boys who were now somewhat wearied by their long voyage from New York
They visited several places of interest in the little city but at an early hour returned to the hotel and sought their rooms
The following morning found them soon after an early breakfast once more on board the Black Growler
They now were about to pass out upon the waters of Lake Ontario
Whatever perils they had experienced from the canalmen were no longer to be faced
If there was danger ahead it would come from the squalls which frequently occurred on Lake Ontario
They were all confident however that they would complete the remainder of their voyage successfully and in high spirits prepared to cast off
Hi Peewee
called George
Are you sure you have got all the gasoline we need
Yes sir Im sure laughed Fred
Thats one predicament Im never going to get caught in again
We may have something else go wrong but well not run short of gasoline
Im glad to hear it said Grant soberly
I noticed from the sounds that came from your room last night that you werent sleeping very well again
I didnt know but you would be so tired this morning that you would forget all about the Black Growler and even the Go Ahead boys
Thats all right laughed Fred
Do I look sleepy this morning
Not especially
Well Im not whether I look so or not retorted Fred
If you are all ready well start
Were all ready answered the Go Ahead boys together and a moment later the Black Growler was speeding on her way toward the waters of the open lake
My what a glorious day this is exclaimed John when a little later the motorboat was fast leaving Oswego behind
Indeed there was much to cause the young sailors to be enthusiastic over the morning
The clear air the morning sunlight the sparkling waters of the beautiful lake all combined to produce an effect that was unlike any which the boys before had experienced
Even the waves appeared to be peaceful
Not a whitecap was in sight
Did you hear what that man on the dock said when we passed
inquired Grant
What man
inquired Fred
What did he say
Why he said we had better take a man along with us that knows the lake
No I didnt hear him said Fred
And if I had it wouldnt have made any difference
I know my way all right and you fellows neednt be afraid that you wont be down among the Thousand Islands in time for dinner
Where shall we get our luncheon Fred
asked George
I dont know yet
It will depend somewhat on where we are
If we can make Cape Vincent all right well have it there
An hour later John said after he had looked out over the lake The wind is getting fresher
Dont you notice it fellows
Yes said George
I hope it will keep it up
I would like to be out here when the Black Growler was rolling a little
I would give a dime to see one of the Go Ahead boys seasick
Dont be so extravagant retorted Fred
Youll only have a chance to lose your money before night
The wind is rising he added a moment later
In the distance the boys saw occasional waves that now were capped with white
The Black Growler also had taken on a rolling motion and although all four of the Go Ahead boys declared that they enjoyed the experience it was noticed after a brief time that Fred was strangely quiet
He was still at the wheel and apparently devoting all his thought to his task
Say fellows will you take a look at Peewee
demanded George about ten minutes later
I believe he is getting sick
Fred turned and glanced at his companions but did not speak
The color and expression of his face however were such as to arouse great elation among his passengers
Thats the way Peewee
laughed John
Youll have to give up your place at the wheel
Im sorry that we havent any doctor on board
There was an old fellow down on Long Island Sound suggested George who used to tell us that the best cure for seasickness was a sweet apple and if that wasnt any good then he suggested swallowing a piece of raw salt pork with a string tied to it
What was the string for
demanded John
If you cant guess I shant tell you laughed George
Im just making these suggestions for little Pygs benefit
He doesnt look as if he was happy
Hi Fred
he added turning to the pilot you had better go back in the stern and lie down
I would answered Fred who was genuinely miserable now if there was any one on board who knew enough to take my place
Any one of us can do it spoke up George glibly
Fred shook his head in token of his unbelief as he said slowly We would go to the bottom
We may go there anyway said John if this wind keeps rising
I want you to notice how much higher the waves are and how many more white caps we can see
I dont know whats going to become of us
The boy spoke seriously and for a moment his companions looked keenly at him
Sometimes it was difficult to decide just what thoughts were in Johns mind
His manner of speaking did not betray his innermost feelings
This time however it was evident that he was anxious if not alarmed and when a moment later Fred declared that he was so miserable that he must find some relief the anxiety of the Go Ahead boys increased greatly
Fred retired to the cockpit and stretched himself at full length upon the cushions of the seats
A ghastly greenish pallor was upon his face and no proof was required that he was far from being happy
John now took the wheel and did his utmost to hold the Black Growler to a steady course
Occasionally the motorboat was caught in the trough of the waves and the spray dashed over the boys
It was not long before every one was wet Fred taking more than his full share of the water
He was however so miserable that he did not protest and even his friends now were silent as they devoted their efforts to holding the motorboat steadily to her course
All thoughts of luncheon were abandoned
Fred of course had passed the stage where the thought of food brought any pleasure while his companions were so busy that they too had forgotten that midday had arrived
You dont need to mind this too much suggested John in his loudest tones
I have seen the wind come up and then go down just as suddenly as it came
Perhaps that will be the way it will be today
Whatever the thoughts in the minds of George and Grant were they did not express them
They were standing near the wheel eagerly looking before them
Each boy was hopeful that a boat might be seen which would come to the aid of the unfortunate Black Growler
Several passing steamers were seen low on the horizon but it was impossible to attract the attention of any
I feel said George at last breaking in upon the silence that we made a great mistake this morning when we didnt take the advice of that man in Oswego
What man
What was his advice
asked Grant
Why the one who told us that we ought not to start out on Lake Ontario without taking some man along with us who knew the course and could help us if we got into a fix
I dont like such remarks at this time said Grant
I never want the man who says I told you so to come around to me with his comfort
I didnt mean it that way protested George
Of course you didnt Pop but were boxed here as sure as you live
There isnt any use in complaining or in spending our time wishing that we had done something else
Is the wind going down any
Not a bit spoke up John
I think its getting stronger if anything
Meanwhile the little boat had been rolling and tossing almost helpless in the trough of the waves
Poor Fred was stretched out at full length on the cushions and the ghastly expression of his face indicated that he at least was not suffering from any fear of the fate which might befall them
He had reached that stage in his sickness wherein he was completely indifferent to his surroundings
Again and again the anxious boys did their utmost to discover the cause of the trouble
They were unable to find any serious defect with the machinery however and their anxiety steadily increased
Several times the motorboat shipped water and once or twice she was thrown with such violence by the onrushing waves that it did not seem possible she could again right herself
The boys were now far from land for only a dim outline of the faraway shore could be seen
They had not taken the direct course to Cape Vincent
Although they might have saved time by doing so it was considered safer to keep near the shore although at no place were they within three miles of it
Another hour elapsed and still the wind continued strong
The sun was shining brightly and the clouds scudding across the face of the sky only occasionally concealed its beams
The supreme hope in the minds of all had been that their predicament would be discovered and that some one would come to their aid
The shore however was so far distant that it was vain to expect help from that direction and on the other hand most of the boats whose courses were marked by trails of smoke were so far away that it was almost impossible for them to discern the drifting motorboat
CHAPTER XI RESCUED No change occurred for another hour in the position in which the boys found themselves
Fred still was lying helpless on the cushions and the boys by taking turns or working together at the wheel had somehow in spite of numerous moments of peril been able to keep the Black Growler headed to the wind
At that time George broke in upon the silence by saying excitedly Look yonder fellows
Isnt that a boat coming this way
Instantly the eyes of all three turned in the direction in which George pointed
Far away a trail of smoke was visible and from the direction in which it was moving it was apparent that it had come from a boat which was coming nearer the place where the boys were drifting than had any boats since their mishap
I believe its coming exclaimed Grant
Well get some help pretty soon
Yes broke in John whose hands now were blistered and whose temper had suffered from his efforts
Yes shes probably bound for Liverpool and wont stop until shes gone across the ocean
A lot of good it will do us
Dont take all the joy out of living String laughed George goodnaturedly
Maybe we shant have any chance to be taken on board but well do our best anyway
Silence followed as the three boys eagerly watched the approaching boat for there was no question in their minds now that the unknown steamer was approaching
A few minutes later Grant said looking through the field glasses at the approaching stranger Thats a yacht of some kind in my opinion
As soon as he had spoken his companions eagerly demanded an opportunity to confirm his statement
Soc is right said John after a long inspection
Of course he is said Grant lightly
He always is right
How many times must I tell you that if you would only follow my advice you would soon be improving
Its no time to joke said John solemnly
Weve just got to make them take us on board or help us out of our trouble
Well have to wait until they come nearer than they are now said George
Have we got a big white cloth that we can use as a signal
I think there are some sheets down in the cabin suggested Grant
Then Ill get them said Grant quickly as he disappeared from sight
In a brief time he returned with two sheets in his arms
Handing one to Grant while John was still busy at the wheel George said excitedly Now we have got to stand up and let them know that were here
It was plain to the watching boys that the approaching boat was a yacht as Grant had suggested
Her graceful outlines now could be plainly seen and she was swiftly approaching
Im wondering suggested George thoughtfully if we are tossing around on the water the way she is
Just look at her he added excitedly as the yacht in the distance pitched visibly in the rough water
Of course we are said John only worse
A little boat like the Black Growler is not worth much more than an egg shell
Still I think I would rather be in the Black Growler laughed George
The spray continued to dash over the motorboat and the little craft was roughly tossed by the passing waves
Fred twice had rolled from his position on the cushions and fallen upon the floor
The assistance of his friends had been required to restore him to his former position
His ghastly appearance by this time had aroused the sympathies of his companions and besides they were all three anxious for the safety of the boat as well as of themselves
The sun was still shining brightly and there was life in the air as it swept across the great mass of fresh water
Steadily the Black Growler had been moving before the wind which was blowing directly from the lake
As a result they were able to see more distinctly the outlines of the shore before them which now was not more than two miles distant
A few minutes had elapsed when George said excitedly Do you see what boat that is
His companions did not reply for a brief time and then Grant said quietly Its the Caledonia
Yes I believe it is joined in John
I know it is said George
Were sure now that well get some help
We may have our troubles suggested Grant if the captain answers our hail or he may pick us up and claim salvage
I guess there wont be anything like that exclaimed George who was greatly relieved by the sight of the approaching yacht
Her black sides glistened in the sunlight and her graceful outline now that she was near had never appeared to greater advantage
Two of the boys were still waving and shaking the sheets as their signals of distress
It was evident however that they had been seen by the crew of the Caledonia and that the big black yacht was directly bearing down upon them
A few minutes later the Caledonia shut off steam and the captain was seen on deck
Approaching the rail with his speaking trumpet in his hand he called Ahoy there
Whats the trouble
Our engine is broken down replied John
Arent you the same boys we towed through the Erie Canal yesterday
Yes sir replied John
You seem to be in trouble most of the way retorted the captain
It seems to me the best thing we can do is to take you up and send you back to your mothers
You arent fit to be out here on Lake Ontario all alone
What do you want us to do
At that moment the owner of the yacht again appeared by the captains side and taking the speaking trumpet from that officer he called to the boys Are you in trouble
Yes sir replied John who still was the spokesman for the Go Ahead boys
What can we do for you
If you will take us on board or give us a tow until we can land somewhere we shall be very grateful to you
Whats the trouble
Thats just what we do not know said John
Have you got plenty of gasoline
Yes sir
Its something wrong with the machinery this time
Fred now was sitting erect and gazing interestedly at the people on the deck of the Caledonia
His face was still ghastly in its color but the opportunity to secure help apparently had aroused him from the semistupor into which he had fallen
I think the best thing will be to take you on board and tow the boat
Were going to put in for the night right here and if there isnt anybody there who can fix up your machinery then youll have to stay until tomorrow morning when we can take you on to Sackets Harbor
I think it will be better for all you boys to come aboard he added
In a sea like this theres no knowing what may happen to a boat in tow
You fellows go on board said Fred
Ill stay here and look after the boat
Youll do nothing of the kind retorted John promptly
If you stay I shall stay with you
It finally was agreed that the four boys should be taken on board the Caledonia and that one of the crew of the yacht should take his place on board the Black Growler and do his best to see that she was guided aright while she was being towed by the larger boat
The big yacht was drifting steadily nearer the motorboat and in a brief time it was possible for a rope to be cast
The boys succeeded in making this fast and then the yacht swung around so that the Black Growler was in the lea
In spite of the rough water the boys succeeded in making their way to the deck of the yacht while one of the crew took his place on board the Black Growler
The motorboat then was dropped back and when the Caledonia started she was fifty feet in the rear of the larger boat
Mr Stevens cordially and yet laughingly greeted the boys whom he dubbed at the time the sons of misfortune
Relieved as the Go Ahead boys were by their rescue they nevertheless all showed traces of chagrin over the fact that twice they had been helped by the big black yacht
Were going to put up at Henderson Harbor explained Mr Stevens
I have some friends staying at the big clubhouse and I have promised to spend the night there
Im sure there will be a welcome for you boys if you wish to stop
It may be however that there will be some one there who can fix you up so that you can go on to Sackets Harbor if you desire
My suggestion is however that you spend the night at the clubhouse
In the morning we can take your boat in tow again and drop you at Sackets Harbor or Cape Vincent for such repairs as you may need
Thank you replied John
Im sure we shall all be glad to do as you suggest
At this time the members of Mr Stevens family approached the little group and the Go Ahead boys one by one were introduced
The ghastly expression on the face of Fred in part disappeared when he was introduced to the older daughter of the owner
Miss Susie Stevens laughed in a manner which increased Freds annoyance when his companions explained the cause of his troubles
I wasnt seasick
declared Fred glibly
I just had a headache
Thats all right Peewee said George in mock seriousness
Thats all right
All I can say is that if I was not seasick Im mighty sure I wouldnt be doing some of the things you did
The young people all laughed at Freds manifest irritation but the subject was changed for the Caledonia by this time was drawing near the island on which the club house they were seeking was located
The water within the harbor was much smoother than on the open lake and the relief from the motion produced by the tossing waves speedily restored Fred so that when at last the yacht was anchored and the Black Growler was safely drawn into the boat house he was ready to take his part with his companions in the events that speedily followed
CHAPTER XII A BATTLE WITH ARMS AND LEGS The Go Ahead boys enjoyed a bath in the lake before they reported at the clubhouse in response to the invitation of Mr Stevens
Even Fred had now thoroughly recovered from his experience and was more than positive that he had not been seasick
His strong words greatly delighted his friends who aware now that he was sensitive concerning the matter lost no opportunity to describe his sufferings which began soon after they set sail from Oswego
At first the boys had insisted that as soon as the difficulty with the Black Growler had been remedied they must proceed at once on their way
When it was found however that there was no mechanic at the clubhouse they were easily persuaded to abandon their project and accept the hospitality of Mr Stevens for the night
Early the following morning a man skilled in all the uncertain ways of motorboats arrived in response to the summons of the officials and in a brief time he discovered that there was nothing seriously wrong with the Black Growler
Indeed within a few minutes he was racing the swift little motorboat over the waters of Lake Ontario which now was calm once more
The clubhouse was located on an island at the entrance of a marvelously beautiful harbor
Three miles inland and about an equal number in length the waters appeared like a great bowl
High wooded shores were seen on one shore and on another a row of attractive cottages behind which the road was visible winding in and out in the direction of Sackets Harbor
Soon after breakfast when Fred declared that it was time for the Go Ahead boys to start Mr Stevens said I think you young gentlemen will do well to take Sam Hodge along with you
Hes an excellent mechanic and if anything goes wrong he will know what to do
How about Fred
demanded George whose eyes twinkled as he spoke
Can he fix him up if he is seasick again
Im not going to be seasick retorted Fred
I wasnt seasick yesterday
I have told you so ten times
Ignoring the protest George said It seems to me it ought to be as easy to adjust the internal workings of Peewee as those of the Black Growler
Perhaps a dose of a similar kind might be good for both
Georges face was expressionless and his voice did not betray his purpose of bantering his diminutive friend
Freds face flushed an angry red for Miss Susie Stevens and other members of the club were standing on the dock when the conversation occurred
Her black eyes twinkled with mischief and it was manifest that she was enjoying the visit of the boys
I think said Grant positively that we had better take Sam Hodge with us
We ought to arrive at your grandfathers place by night Fred and he can come back by train
Thats right
Thats right spoke up John quickly
I had to steer the Black Growler most of the time yesterday and my arms are lame
All the length of them
asked George
Why think when John has a pain how long he must have it
John turned quickly upon his tormentor as he said Thats the thirteenth time I have heard you get off that old joke
You mustnt take him too seriously Miss Susie he added turning to the girl who was laughing at George s suggestion
You know what his nickname is dont you
No I cannot say that I do replied Miss Susie
Well we call him Pop
Why
she inquired
Because hes the papa of his country
He is named for George Washington who is the Father of his Country but the name doesnt go very far
Thats all right spoke up George
Up yonder where your topknot is theres an aching void
I read the other day that Sydney Smith said Nature never built a man more than seven stories high without leaving the top loft empty
On the contrary spoke up John all the great men have been those who could look down on the rest of the world
Huh
broke in Grant it will do you good to find out how much of your statement is really true
What do you think of Caesar Napoleon William of Orange General Grant Alexander Stephens Alexander Hamilton That will do my son
That will do said John patting Grant upon the head
That is a sufficiency of information this morning
Pray desist
In other words shut up
If we dont stop you pretty soon youll start in on the matter of canals again
All the way up from New York he added turning to Miss Susie as he spoke he has been giving us undigested and undesirable information about the canals
He even said that the Amsterdam Canal connected the Zuider Zee with the North Sea
So it does said Grant quickly
If youll tell me how long that canal is Ill buy the dinner when we stop at Cape Vincent
One hundred and sixtyfive miles declared John promptly
As he spoke however he glanced at his cuff on which the fact was plainly written
That doesnt count declared Grant
No ponying in this game
Look up into the sky John which isnt very far from you and if youll tell me how long the Panama Canal is Ill call it square and buy the dinner
ThePanamaCanalisisquite long
So I have heard laughed Grant
I guess you buy the dinner
How long is it
inquired John
I knew but I have forgotten
Its fifty and onehalf miles long
Here comes Sam Hodge Grant added as the boatman came alongside the dock
Are you going with us
he inquired as he quickly approached the dock
Wheres that
inquired Sam
Down the St Lawrence River
How far
Oh down among the Thousand Islands thats all
First I have heard of it said Sam
I think it will be a good thing if you can go with the boys Sam spoke up Mr Stevens
They had a mishap yesterday and didnt quite know what to do
Sure Ill go said Sam
Fred made no protests and the terms with the mechanic were speedily arranged
A halfhour later the Black Growler set forth on her voyage
The Caledonia was to follow some time that day and plans already had been made by which the boys were to spend some time on Hecla Island on which was located the summer home of the Stevens
Fortunately for Fred at least the lake continued to be calm
In the eagerness of the boy to prove to his friends that he merely had a headache the preceding day and had not been seasick he was unusually busy
Sam called the attention of the Go Ahead boys to the post at Sackets Harbor
On a bluff above the lake the barracks and other buildings of the place were plainly visible
Even the soldiers stationed there could be plainly seen as they moved about the quarters
Thats a great place to have an army post said George
I cant think of any place better unless its in the middle of the Sahara Desert
Why did the government establish a post here
Because there was a fort here way back in the War of 1812 answered Grant promptly
Sackets Harbor was the headquarters of the army of the North and so the place has been kept up ever since
Do any of you want to stop
inquired Fred glancing at his companions as he spoke
Not I replied John quickly
When we have a good sea like this and Fred can be safe from the misery he suffered yesterday Im not for taking any chances of the wind coming up later
Thats mighty kind of you growled Fred
I never knew you to be so thoughtful of any one except yourself
Dont say that said John
You dont mean it
What you mean is that this is the first time you ever have appreciated how good I am
Huh began Fred in response
His reply however was interrupted by Sam Hodge as he said This is a mighty good boat
She must have cost a pile of money
She did said George quickly
Fred had to save up his spending money for several days before he bought her
You dont talk like a native around here Sam
Where did you come from
I come from New York answered Sam
What were you doing there
Oh I worked in a factory where we made legs and feet and arms for dummies and models
Fine job laughed George
Did you like it
I liked the job all right replied Sam but I didnt like our foreman
I quit on account of him
What was wrong with him
Everything said Sam quietly
So that was why you left and came up here to work on motorboats was it
Yes answered Sam
That foreman was the hardest man to get along with I ever saw
I put up with it for months but finally there came a day when I decided I wouldnt stand any more of it
What happened
Why I had a sore hand and I asked him to cut one of my feet off and he cut it off for me and then he got mad at something I said and threw one of his legs at me
Then not satisfied with that he took one of the girls feet and threw that at me too
Of course I got mad
I picked up one of my legs in my hand and I tried to defend myself and then he hit me in the eye with one of his hands and knocked me over among a lot of legs and arms
He almost broke my foot and Did you say he cut one of your feet off
asked Grant soberly looking down at the pedal extremities of the mechanic as he did so
Thats just what he did answered Sam
But it seems to be all right now protested Fred
You dont quite see said Sam
Im talking about the foreman of the factory where I worked over on Broome Street
We manufactured legs and feet and arms for dummies and models like I was telling you
Like those that we see in the show windows
Thats it exactly said Sam
Those dummies and models that they put in the store windows to display gowns on
I was working on one of the artificial feet and I mean he broke it
Oh no he didnt cut one of my REAL feet off
But he did hit me in the eye with one of his hands
I see said George seriously
It was an artificial eye of yours that he hit
No it wasnt retorted Sam
It was my real eye
But he hit it with one of his artificial hands
Is that it or did he hit it with one of the hands he manufactured
No
No said Sam
He hit me in my real eye with his real hand
And that was why you picked up one of your legs and he took one of the girls feet and he hit you in the real eye no I mean the artificial eye with his real handthats not quite it
I mean he hit you in the hand with his artificial eye
No that isnt it either
Hold on
He threw one of his legs at you and then he took his eye and threw it at one of the girls feet
Hold on Im getting all mixed up
I cant tell just where I am at
Say it again Sam
I think its better for a man to have a wooden leg than it is to have a wooden head spoke up Fred
Splendid Peewee
Fine
laughed George
Thats immense
Great
Sam he added soberly as he turned to the mechanic who was now steering the Black Growler did you say you made artificial legs and arms and feet
Thats what I said acknowledged Sam
Did you ever manufacture artificial heads
Lots of em
Lots of em
Have you got any with you
No I havent
Im sorry said George
There are several reasons why I should like to buy one
Meanwhile the Black Growler swiftly and greatly to the delight of Sam was speeding over the smooth waters
Scarcely a ripple was to be seen
The reflection of the sunlight increased the discomfort of the Go Ahead boys and all four were rejoiced when at last Cape Vincent was sighted in the distance
CHAPTER XII A SURPRISE Wait a minute fellows
called Fred when his companions prepared to depart from the dock and go to the hotel for their luncheon
I have lost my knife
I think I must have dropped it somewhere behind the cushions
The boys halted on the dock while Fred speedily turned over the cushions
He did not discover his missing knife but he did find a large envelope lying directly beneath the cushion in the stern of the cockpit
Whats that
he called as he held the paper up to view
Have any of you fellows lost anything
All three Go Ahead boys declared that the paper did not belong to any of them
Approaching the place where Fred was standing on board and still looking at the document Grant suggested that he should open the envelope as it was unsealed and unaddressed
Fred followed the suggestion and to the amazement as well as to the consternation of his friends he drew forth a bond for five thousand dollars
For a moment an expression of blank amazement appeared on the faces of all on board
Whats that
demanded Fred at last
Whose is it
What is it doing on board the Black Growler
Its a railway mortgage bond and given by one of the strongest railroads in the United States said Grant who had been looking carefully at the surprising discovery which his friend had made
Is it good for anything
inquired John
Not much laughed Grant
Only five thousand dollars thats all
Do you mean to tell me you could get five thousand dollars for that piece of paper
Yes sir I think you could
Well then said John why dont we do it
It may be as good as money as you say but I think Id rather see the cold cash
Where can we get the money
It might take a little time to get it cashed but almost any bank would pay it
Its not a registered bond and it looks as if it was all right every way
Yes but whose is it
said Fred
Thats what troubles me
I guess you wont have any trouble in finding out whose bond it is laughed George
Though I must confess I dont see how it came on board
Neither do I said Fred slowly
It must have been here some time
Yes said John dryly
I guess this is the first time we have turned over or shaken out the cushions
 We have shaken out is good retorted Fred
I was doing this little job all myself
There wasnt a fellow who offered to lend a hand
But what shall I do with the thing
he added
Put it in your pocket now said Grant and wait until we have had our luncheon
We can talk it over while we are at the table and decide what is the best thing to do
Grants advice was followed
Fred thrust the bond into the envelope and then placed the package in the inner pocket of his jacket
Throughout their meal the discovery of the bond was the chief topic of conversation
The mystery of its presence on board the Black Growler as well as that of its ownership again and again were talked over but no satisfactory conclusion had been obtained when at last the boys departed from the hotel
Ill tell you what well do fellows said Grant
Lets take that bond down to the bank
There must be one or two banks here and we can find out about it and leave it there if it is thought best
It may be that we shant want to be found with the goods on us a little later
Thats all right Soc said Fred who was more nervous than any of the boys concerning the discovery which he had made
Ill find out where theres a bank
In response to his inquiries Fred soon was informed where a bank could be found and together with his companions at once entered it
He inquired for the president and soon was introduced to that official
Briefly Fred then related the story of the discovery of the bond
The man before him listened attentively and when Fred ceased he said Let me see the bond
As soon as he received it he carefully read its contents and then said slowly That is a perfectly good bond and is worth at least fiftytwo hundred and fifty dollars
What do you intend to do with it
Thats what we wanted to ask you explained Fred
And you havent any idea where it came from
inquired the banker looking keenly at Fred as he spoke
Not the slightest answered Fred
I never was more surprised in my life than when I found that bond under the cushion on our boat
Hum said the banker slowly
Will you accept a suggestion from me
Yes sir said Fred eagerly
Thats what we came for
Then my advice to you is to leave the bond here
Ill give you a description of it and the number and will make such inquiries as are in my power concerning its ownership
You must give me your names and addresses and tell me where I can get you on the phone within the next few days if I want to call you
Fred glanced questioningly at his companions and when Grant nodded his head he said All right Mr My name is Reese explained the banker
All right Mr Reese said Fred
You give us the paper and well be glad to leave the bond here in your keeping
Have you any idea he added how that bond may have been placed on board our boat
No sir not the slightest replied the banker
Mr Reese retired from the room in which the boys were waiting and in a moment returned stating that as soon as the chief facts concerning the bond had been transcribed he would give a copy to the boys
Meanwhile he took the names of all four Go Ahead boys and also their addresses
I know your grandfather quite well he explained when Fred gave his name as that in the care of which all letters and messages for the boys should be sent
He frequently comes up to Cape Vincent in his yacht
I am glad to meet you on his account as well as on your own
The task at last having been completed the Go Ahead boys at once started toward the dock where their motorboat had been left
As they drew near the place John suddenly stopped and clutching George by his arm who was walking beside him said Look at that man over on the dock
Who is it
Its the fellow who was the leader of that gang of canalmen that boarded us the other morning
What do you suppose hes doing here
demanded John in a whisper
I cant say
Im not sure that it is the same man but it certainly looks like him
The boys stopped and excitedly explained to their friends the discovery which they had made
The opinion was general as soon as all had looked at the man that it was indeed their unwelcome visitor who had fled precipitately with his companions when the Caledonia had stopped to aid them
The stranger was only a few yards from the place where the Black Growler had been made fast and as the boys approached he looked up and said with a laugh Glad to see yer
I thought Id come down and look ye up
I wonder if yer got any gasoline
Yes sir we have answered Fred tartly
He was not desirous of continuing the conversation
Sam Hodge who had come with the boys from Henderson Harbor had departed soon after the landing at Cape Vincent had been made
Consequently the Black Growler had been left without any one on board when the Go Ahead boys had gone to the hotel for their luncheon
Whether or not the man before them had made investigations or helped himself to anything of value on board the boat no one knew
There was however no one to prevent him from doing such things as he had desired
Where did you come from
demanded George as he stepped in front of the stranger
I jes started for me summer home laughed the canalman
I didnt think I would go down before the Fourth of July but the sight of you boys made me homesick
Where is your island
I cant jes describe it said the man but if youll give me a lift in your boat Ill pint it out to you when we come to it
How did you come down here
demanded George
The same as any gintleman might come
I thought of comin in me yacht but I finally decided Id take me own car and in that way I would be indepindent of the whole world
Now then boys he added Im a bit fearful that I shant be able to stay with ye very long
Did any of ye find a document of any value after I left ye the other day
I was a bit sorry I couldnt stop to shake hands with ye but there were several reasons why me and me pals thought it might be a good thing not to interfere with you when your friends on that black yacht stopped to say good mornin
The four boys looked shyly at one another every one of them convinced that the mystery of the presence of the bond which they had discovered was in part explained
What was your document
asked Grant
That wasnt what I said replied the man
I asked you if you had found any document
Of course wed find a good many things on board explained Grant
Youll have to tell us just what it is you lost if you want us to say whether or not we have found it
You found it all the same
I can see it by the look in your eyes declared the man
Now what I want to know is if youll give it up peaceablelike or do you want me to call a policeman and get him to help me take what belongs to me
CHAPTER XIV A SURPRISING PASSENGER We havent got your bond said Fred quickly
He was somewhat uneasy as he was aware when he glanced keenly at the man that he was unusually strong and if he really had obtained possession of the security in a way that was open to suspicion it was quite probable that he would not hesitate to defend what he had taken
Fred glanced anxiously about the dock to ascertain if help was near in case it should be required
Where is it
demanded the stranger
We found it on the boat
Yes I know you did interrupted the man but what I want is for you to let me see it or tell me where it is
I tell you we havent got it said Fred
Where is it
Its where it will be safe until it can be looked up and we find out whose it is
Where did you get that bond
demanded George abruptly breaking in upon the conversation
Did I say it was mine
demanded the stranger
You asked for it
If I recall I asked about it
Thats the same thing retorted George
Not quite said the man
Now then will you tell me where it is
I dont think we shall spoke up Fred
If youll tell me who owns it and what it was doing on our motorboat then perhaps Ill be willing to talk with you
Then you say youll not tell me where it is
said the man speaking slowly and looking savagely at Fred as he spoke
I shant tell you said Fred
Now if youre done well start
As he spoke Fred stepped on board the Black Growler an action which was speedily followed by his companions
Advancing to the wheel Fred inspected everything to satisfy himself that all things were in readiness for their departure and then said to the man waiting on the dock Well have to bid you goodby
At the same time he turned on the power
As George and John pushed the little boat out from the dock it began to move but not before the canalman unbidden suddenly leaped on board
Thank you for your very kind invitation he said as he seated himself on the cushions
We didnt ask you to come spoke up Fred and we dont want your company
Youll have to go ashore
Is that so
laughed the man banteringly
Yes sir its so
retorted Fred
Well then if I go ashore I think there will be somebody going with me
Youre mistaken said Fred
Were going down among the Thousand Islands
That doesnt make any difference to me
Im going to find out who took that bond
If you dont tell me where it is then I shall go to a constable or justice and get out a warrant for you
You have owned up that you had the bond on board your boat
It was a stolen bond and I have been trying to run it down for some time
Now I have found it or at least I have found the party that had it and you try to bluff me by saying that you wont tell me where it is
Now Ill give you your choice
You can have my company for I shant leave you until I find out more about it or you can try to put me ashore and Ill get help
Just as sure as youre sitting here Ill swear out a warrant and have you arrested for stealing that bond
The boys were inexperienced and for a moment they stared blankly at one another startled more than they were willing to acknowledge by the bold threat of their unwelcome passenger
Well what is it
said the man a moment later when no reply had been given to his questions
Which do you want
The thing for us to do said Grant in a low voice to Fred is to keep right on
Well take this man down to your grandfathers island and when we get there well tell him all about it
Hell know best what to do and well wait for his advice before we do anything
Thats all right Soc said Fred greatly relieved by the words of his friend
Then turning to their passenger he said more boldly than before he had spoken I guess well take our chances and have you go with us
Well find out more about this later and give you a chance to tell your story
Its all the same to me said the man glibly
Ill be glad to have the ride anyway
Its been a long time since I have been on the St Lawrence River
Apparently Freds threat had produced slight effect upon the addition to their party
He spoke as if he were in no fear for himself while his threat to swear out a warrant for the boys although it had startled them had not greatly alarmed any one
Meanwhile the Black Growler almost as if she was sharing in the excitement of the boys was speeding swiftly down the river
The broad expanse of water when she left her dock at Cape Vincent soon was broken by the sight of many islands some of which were miles in extent while others were tiny little spots just lifted above the surface of the water
There was some anxiety on the part of John that unfamiliar as they were with the channel they might strike some hidden rock but Fred assured his friend that there was slight danger of that in the daytime as a careful watch was maintained and it was easy for them to follow the course of boats that were in advance of them
Look yonder
said George suddenly pointing as he spoke to a yacht that was swiftly approaching from the Canadian side of the river
Do you know what boat that is
exclaimed John
We ought to know it said Fred
Thats the Varmint II
She beat us down here by a good deal suggested George who was keenly observing the graceful and swift little motorboat that was steadily approaching
I dont know about that retorted Fred
She may be just coming now
Dont you believe it retorted George
She has been here a long time and theyre just out testing her on the river
Are you going to try to race with her here
I am not retorted Fred promptly
It will be time enough when we see what she can do in the real race
That wont be for three weeks yet
How many races do they have down here in the summer
inquired John
I dont know answered Fred
Two I guess
One will be enough this summer Im thinking laughed John
What are we going to do with that man
As he spoke John glanced again at the uninvited and unwelcome passenger who apparently was taking his ease on the cushions in the stern of the boat
Im going to do nothing said Fred quickly
I think I will leave him alone until we land at my grandfathers island and then I will tell him all about it
What do you suppose he is
inquired John glancing again at the man who apparently was unaware of the interest his presence on board the Black Growler had aroused
I havent any idea
How did he know about that bond
I cant tell you
Do you suppose he stole it
It doesnt seem so to me said Fred slowly as he shook his head
If he stole it I cant understand why he comes down here after it
You would think he would want to put a long distance between himself and that bond after he lost it
And yet he seemed bold enough when he told us to tell him where it is
What do you suppose made him think of that
Think of what
Why that we had put it somewhere
Its the most natural thing in the world retorted Fred glibly
He would know that fellows like us wouldnt want to keep a bond of that size
I am wondering what it all means
First thing you know that man will jump on us all and take the Black Growler away from us
I tell you hes a desperate character
Just look at those hands
If he had his coat off I tell you you would see the muscles of his shoulders stand out like great knots
Hes a powerful brute and I dont like his disposition
I wish he was somewhere else
I guess he wouldnt attack us laughed Fred
Were four to one and even if hes stronger than any one of us hes not as strong as all four of us put together
I tell you said John more positively hes a pirate
Hes a regular pirate
He stole that bond and tried to take the motorboat away from us when we were on the canal and I shall feel mighty well satisfied if he doesnt get it away from us now before we go very much farther
I confess its all mighty queer John but I dont believe the man will attack us
He has got too many matters just now to look after to try such a fool thing as that
But I cant understand why he forces himself on board and why he insists on going with us down the river
I shouldnt be surprised to have him stop us when we are in some quiet place and search the boat
How does he know that the bond isnt here
Because he has searched the Black Growler already replied Fred
You may be sure he has gone through every nook and cranny before we came back from the bank
I guess youre right assented John as once more he glanced apprehensively at the man who was the subject of their conversation
I dont know of but one way to get even with him suggested Fred
Whats that
Why to set Soc on him and make him answer questions about canals
Im telling you that if Grant should ask him about how wide the Suez Canal is or how deep the Sault Ste
Marie is hed get an answer that would surprise him
I havent any doubt about that said John somewhat ruefully
The man is a surprise anyway
John spoke more truly than he knew
The surprise that was occasioned by the presence of their unbidden guest was mild compared with that which soon followed
CHAPTER XV AN UPSET The Black Growler carried forward by the current of the mighty river as well as by her own power brought the party on board to their destination late in the afternoon
It was the first time that Freds friends had seen the spot
The clear running water of the great river the skies without a cloud the sight of the numberless camps and cottages as well as of the many yachts and motorboats that were to be seen on the river all combined to increase the interest of the Go Ahead boys
When at last they arrived at the island owned by Freds grandfather their enthusiasm became still greater
A beautiful cottage which really was a house with twenty rooms was located in a grove of high trees
The boathouse ample and attractive in every way and the sight of several skiffs that had been made fast to the dock caused George to exclaim in his impulsive manner There isnt a place like it in all the world
I never saw such a spot before in all my life
But youre young yet suggested Grant soberly
But I have seen some things even if I am young retorted George
I thought Mackinac Island was beautiful but this has some things you cant find up there
Spoken like a philosopher again retorted John
The expression on his face was serious as he hastily made inquiries concerning Grants missing bag
The poor chap he explained is in trouble
He cant wear any clothes that fit the rest of us and unless he gets help soon we shall have to lock him in the boathouse for he wont be presentable anywhere
To Grants delight his bag already was in his room awaiting his coming
The mistake had occurred at Albany which had caused as much trouble to the owner of the other bag as Grant himself had suffered
As soon as the boys were ready they all went down to the broad piazza which adjoined the house on three sides and there were greeted cordially by Freds grandfather and grandmother
Were always glad to see Freddie said Mrs Button beaming affectionately upon her grandson as she spoke and you may be sure that his friends are all as welcome as he is
Thank you Mrs Button said George promptly
If you knew how glad we are to be here you might feel almost as if you were doing missionary work in inviting us
She will think shes doing missionary work Im afraid spoke up Grant
I want to warn you Mrs Button that when George gets into the dining room youll have to drive him out
Its the only way we can get him to stop
Mrs Button smiled as she said Thats just the kind of a guest I like
Meanwhile Fred had not been with his companions when they had gone to their rooms for he had remained behind to talk with his grandfather concerning the uninvited passenger who had arrived with them
Yes Fred explained he was with some other men canalmen we thought they were that boarded us between Utica and Rome and we couldnt get rid of them
I thought at first they were going to try to take the Black Growler away from us but they didnt do that and when Mr Stevens came along in the Caledonia and stopped to help us they all ran away
We didnt think that we would ever see any of them again but up here at Cape Vincent who should show up but this man
What did he come for
inquired Mr Button
We couldnt understand it at first replied Fred but Grandfather we found under a cushion a bond for five thousand dollars
You did WHAT
We found a bond for five thousand dollars
What kind of a bond was it
I dont know said Fred somewhat foolishly
I know it was a railroad bond
What did you do with it
We took it to the bank in Cape Vincent
We left it there with the man who is in charge
Did you get a receipt for it
Yes sir
Thats right
Thats right said Mr Button nodding his head approvingly
Go on
Well when we came back from the bank whom should we find on board our motorboat but this same man that we had seen on the Erie Canal
He demanded that we should give up the bond
So he knew about the bond did he
So it seemed
But we told him we didnt have it
Then he wanted to know what we had done with it and we wouldnt tell him
When we wanted him to go ashore he wouldnt do it and just stayed on board and said he was coming with us
I thought it was better to let him come That was kind of you broke in his grandfather with a smile
I thought it was better to let him come and turn him over to you to deal with than it was for us to have any trouble up there at Cape Vincent
Thats all right Fred said his grandfather
Ill go right down there and talk with him
Fred watched his grandfather as he started toward the dock and then he quickly entered the house and went to his room
A halfhour later when he returned to the piazza and joined his friends who already were seated there his grandfather bidding him follow him to the library said as soon as the door was closed behind them What about that bond
I told you all I know
You say it was a five thousand dollar bond
Yes sir
And a railroad bond
Yes sir
Do you remember which road
Yes sir
It was the New York Central
But you dont know what kind of a bond
No sir
I didnt know there was more than one kind
Perhaps youll know more about that later replied Mr Button dryly
Did this man that came with us know anything more than we did about it
Ignoring the question Mr Button said Your friend has gone
Who
The man we brought with us
Yes
I had Tom take him over to Alexandria Bay in the Jessie
And where is he going
inquired Fred astounded by the statement of his grandfather
He will go to Syracuse
Whether he will stay there or not I do not know
But what did he say
asked Fred somewhat impatiently
Do you think he stole the bond
There are a good many things that are somewhat strange connected with this affair
I am quite inclined to think your bond is good
About this man there are some matters that must be cleared up before I can make any explanations to you
Rising as he spoke Mr Button led the way back to the piazza and Fred was convinced that it was useless for him to talk any more for the present at least about the man or the bond
The following morning the four Go Ahead boys set forth in the Black Growler on a voyage on the river
Fred was eager to show the wonders of the great St Lawrence to his friends and equally desirous of trying out the motorboat
In the time which was to intervene before the race was held he was eager to make himself familiar with every feature of the marvelous little craft
All things were novel and interesting to his companions both in the scenery through which they were passing and the detailed parts of the Black Growler
My grandfather says exclaimed Fred that if we want to we can send over to Henderson Harbor and perhaps can get Sam Hodge to come here
He will be a good man to have on board when we are in that race
I never saw any one that knew more about machinery than he did
Im telling you that youre still youthful remarked Grant
Your experience is very limited
That may be so acknowledged Fred with a laugh but its something Ill get over
Look yonder
broke in John
Theres the Varmint II ahead of us
I wonder if you can catch up with her
As he spoke John turned and winked slowly at George who at once advanced to Freds side
Of course I can catch her if I want to declared Fred
Which means that if you dont want to you cant catch her laughed John derisively
I dont believe theres anything you want more than to catch up with her
I can do it said Fred
Thats easy to say
Irritated by the laughter of his companions who were eager to test the swiftness of their boat Fred at once turned on more power and the Black Growler instantly responded
The boat seemed almost to sink a foot or more into the water as she plowed her way up the river
In a brief time the crew of the Varmint II were aware of the swiftly approaching boat but instead of entering into the contest they did not increase their speed
In a few minutes the Black Growler swiftly passed the Varmint II and as they did so George said mockingly Splendid
Splendid Fred
All you need is to have the other boat stand still and you can win out every time
I gave her every chance retorted Fred
May be you did answered George but she didnt think it was worth while to take up your challenge
She didnt dare to spoke up John who was loyal to his friend
That all may be so laughed George derisively
There was nothing he enjoyed more than teasing Fred and as this was a comparatively easy matter it is not surprising that he frequently engaged in the task
Meanwhile the Black Growler swept onward in her course at last starting on her return voyage
Not far from the island owned by Freds grandfather was another island which the boys already had been informed had been rented by Mr Stevens for the summer
When Fred pointed out the spot his companions were at once interested and suggested that he should stop at the dock which almost seemed to invite their coming
Theres Susie Stevens now called John pointing as he spoke to a nearby canoe in which two young girls were seated
One of them was paddling while her companion was seated in the opposite end of the frail little craft
At the moment of Johns discovery apparently Miss Susie also became aware of the approach of the Black Growler
As she lifted her paddle to salute the Go Ahead boys her companion who doubtless was unfamiliar with canoes reached forward to pick up a sweater to wave at the motorboat she suddenly destroyed the balance of the little canoe
Instantly it was overturned and both girls were thrown into the St Lawrence
CHAPTER XVI THE RESCUE A cry of horror and alarm arose from the startled boys when they beheld the accident
In a moment one of the girls was seen swimming near the overturned canoe
The other however was not within sight
Its time for us to do something
shouted John who was almost beside himself in his excitement
Fred at once had changed the course of the Black Growler but a semicircle was necessary to be turned before she could approach the place where the girls had fallen into the river
Grant meanwhile promptly had removed his sweater and taken off his sneakers preparing to go to the assistance of the unfortunate girls
As he was the strongest and swiftest swimmer his companions by common consent had expected him to be the one to leap into the water
A moment later it was seen that one of the girls had seized the canoe
In her desperation however the frail little craft was overturned and she lost her hold and again disappeared from sight
At that moment the motorboat approached within twentyfive feet of the place where the accident had occurred
Shouting to his friends to take the canoe and do their utmost to rescue the unfortunate girl Grant dived from the deck of the Black Growler and a moment later with powerful strokes was swiftly approaching the victims of the accident
Meanwhile following the instructions of Grant John and George had been able with a boathook to reach the overturned canoe and drawing it speedily to them both carefully and hastily took their places on board
Get one of the girls while I am getting the other called Grant as he turned his head for a moment toward his companions
At that instant Grant saw the face of one of the girls appear on the surface but a moment later it again disappeared from sight
The current was moderately strong and aware that when she again was seen it would be a little farther down the river Grant slowly moved with the stream
The depth of the water made it impossible for him to dive in an effort to find her in the depths
Carefully he scanned the water all about him and when in a brief time her face once more was seen and only a few feet farther down the stream with two powerful strokes he darted forward and succeeded in seizing the girl by the hair of her head just as she began to sink once more
Grant was elated when he discovered that the girl was still conscious
Holding to her hair with one hand he contrived to place himself behind her
Then holding her up by one hand with which he grasped her under the shoulder he said hastily Dont move
Dont try to do anything for yourself
There dont do that he added as the frantic girl made an effort to seize him
Dont touch me
Keep just as you are and youll be all right
In a measure his orders were obeyed
Instead of trying to swim toward the boat Grant was simply doing his utmost to keep himself and his companion afloat
He was treading water and moving with the current
At the same time he looked all about him for help
He saw two of his friends in the canoe and was relieved when he discovered that John who in his excitement had neglected to drop the boathook was holding the long implement toward the other girl who already had grasped it with both hands and was being drawn toward the boys
Come here and help me shouted Grant
He was hoping that his two friends would be able to rescue the other girl or at least prevent her from sinking but he was well aware that if he and his companion were to be saved help soon must be had
In response to his hail Fred turned the bow of the Black Growler and slowly approached the place where Grant was struggling
The girl now was motionless and Grants great anxiety was in a measure relieved
He had been fearful that she would try to seize him by the neck or arms and prevent him from doing anything to help either of them
Grant was aware also that his strength would not permit him to continue the struggle much longer
Already he was breathing heavily and all his powers were required to keep himself and the nearly unconscious girl afloat
He had been able thus far to hold her head above the water for fortunately at this time the river was unusually calm
Again almost in despair he looked back at the motorboat
Here
called Fred who had left the wheel and was standing in the bow holding a rope in his hand
Catch this
He had hastily tied a noose in the end and as he threw this toward the struggling boy Grant fortunately grasped it
By a supreme effort he managed to slip one arm through the noose and as soon as this had been done Fred instantly began to pull
Several times in spite of all the care Fred was exercising the heads of Grant and his companion were drawn beneath the water
Still Grant managed to maintain his hold upon the girl and in a brief time they were drawn alongside the Black Growler
I cant pull you both up called Fred in his excitement
No gasped Grant
I dont think you can pull either one of us
While he was speaking he had contrived to slip the noose over the shoulders and under the arms of his companion
As soon as this had been done he released his hold and said to Fred You can keep her head out of the water anyway
If your noose holds shes all right
What are you going to do
demanded Fred
Im all right responded Grant as turning himself upon his back he floated with the current and obtained a brief rest
Meanwhile John and George had drawn Miss Susie Stevens to the canoe and seized her by her hands
John had been seated in the stern but now he stretched himself upon the bottom of the little craft and reached over with his hands one on each side of the canoe and held the girl up so that she was able to breathe although he did not attempt to draw her out of the water
Take your paddle he called to George
Ive got her all right but make for the Black Growler
Theres no knowing what will happen
In this manner the canoe slowly was paddled toward the motorboat but Fred was holding the rope by which the second girl was held and consequently was unable to respond to the appeal of his friends to come to their aid
Meanwhile the motorboat was drifting with the current and there was grave danger that she might run aground on some one of the numerous islands
Indeed this was just what occurred a few minutes later
The keel of the boat now grated on the rocky bottom
Grant who had been following the same course now obtained a precarious foothold and at once advanced to the aid of the helpless girl
He was still breathing heavily from his own exertions and his strength had not fully returned
Stumbling slipping on the rocks twice nearly falling into the river he managed to draw the girl up on the shore and as soon as he was satisfied that she was living he called to Fred Go on back and help the other fellows and Ill run up to this cottage and get some one to look after this girl
Give me a push Im almost grounded called Fred frantically
The engine had been reversed and the added help which Grant gave as he pushed hard against the bow sent the motorboat back into the river
Satisfied that there was nothing more to be done Grant once more turned and as fast as he was able ran toward the cottage located fifty yards back from the shore
In response to his appeal two women and a man at once ran toward the place where Grant had left the girl
Please look after her said Grant hastily
I want to go back to help the others
We had an accident he explained
The boy was rapidly recovering his breath by this time and as already he had seen a little skiff at the nearby dock without asking permission or explaining what he was about to do he ran to the place cast off and leaped on board
A few powerful strokes sent him out upon the river once more and in a brief time he was near the place where the canoe was drifting
Cautiously approaching it he soon was able to grasp Miss Susie Stevens under her arms and draw her on board the skiff
By this time the motorboat had approached the spot but Grant called to Fred Ill take her right ashore where I took the other girl
Wait for me out here or at the dock
Well help you called George from the canoe
All right answered Grant
Nothing more was said while the skiff and the canoe were soon swiftly towed toward the dock
Willing hands were there awaiting their coming for the entire household now had been aroused and was watching the events on the river
In a brief time Miss Susie was lifted to the dock
She was still able to stand and declared sturdily that she did not require any help
However two of the women one on each side were helping her and in a brief time she was assisted to the house and taken within the cottage
What shall we do now fellows
inquired Grant blankly as he turned to greet his companions
We had better wait replied George and take them back home as soon as they are able to go
I guess thats good advice responded Grant
Shouting to Fred he bade him bring the Black Growler to the dock and make her fast there while they waited for the more complete restoration of the girls whom they had rescued
CHAPTER XVII SENDING FOR SAM The waiting of the boys continued longer than any of them had expected
An hour passed and still no one appeared from the cottage
I wonder if theres anything wrong said Fred as he glanced anxiously at the door
I guess not answered George promptly
The girls probably are exhausted but I dont think theres anything serious
They came out of it a good deal better than I was afraid they would at first
Following Georges statement the two girls were seen at that moment departing from the house
Accompanying them on their way to the dock were several members of the household who were doing their utmost to assist them
Apparently however their services were neither required nor requested for in a moment both girls moved quickly in advance of the little company and approached the dock
Stepping quickly on board Miss Susie said What did you do with my canoe
We have got it here for you in tow
We thought you would probably want to take it with you and were going to carry you home
Thats very good of you laughed the girl as she glanced back at her companion to make sure that she too had boarded the motorboat
If youre all ready to go suggested Fred well start right away
We have been waiting until you were ready
Thats very good of you again said the girl quickly
I havent thanked my life preservers yet for what they did
If you had not been there where you were the accident never would have happened she added boldly
For a moment the four Go Ahead boys stared blankly at the girl who apparently had forgotten all their efforts to rescue her and her companion
Fortunately for the boys they had had other suits of clothing in the cabin of their boat so that all four now were clothed and dry
But to have all their heroism forgotten and to be blamed for being the cause of the accident was something which had not even remotely occurred to them
Yes declared the girl if you had left us alone we wouldnt have tipped over
What was it we did
demanded George
Why you came up with your old motorboat and when I tried to be polite Mildred thought she had to do the same thing and then over we went
Well that was the time when it was fortunate for you that we happened to be nearby said John dryly
Thats just what you had to do you couldnt have helped yourselves
In spite of the words of the animated girl who apparently now had recovered her spirits and strength it was plain to the boys that she was genuinely grateful for the rescue which they had made
She was a deeply interested spectator of the work of the boys in casting off and starting their swift boat and even insisted upon being permitted to steer part of the way
Have you joined the yacht club yet
she inquired
Whats that
demanded George
Why the St Lawrence Yacht Club
I am sure Freds grandfather must belong and probably that will be enough of an introduction
We have some fine times there
Tennis all day dances in the evenings and I dont know what all
You must be sure to come over there
You may be sure well come spoke up George promptly
Now I want to know he added what our reward is to be for our heroic rescue of two forlorn maidens who were sinking in the cold waters of the St Lawrence River
I think virtue will have to be its own reward in this case laughed Mildred
You ought to be satisfied with the honor you have won
Fortunately the island which Mr Stevens had rented was not far distant and not many minutes had elapsed before it was plainly seen by them all
Before a landing was made however Miss Susie Stevens had suggested numerous plans for picnics cruises among the islands meetings for tennis at the yacht club and various other methods by which the days were to be passed
As soon as their passengers departed the Black Growler was headed swiftly for Chestnut Island the name by which the place owned by Freds grandfather was commonly called
Upon their arrival they were informed that already Mr Button had telephoned for Sam Hodge and that he had received word that the man would arrive the following morning
I hope hell bring all his legs and arms with him suggested George with a laugh
What do you mean
inquired Mr Button
Why he has a choice assortment explained George
It seems he used to work in a shop on Broome Street in New York City where they make legs and heads and arms for dummies
I dont understand yet said Mr Button blankly
Why these wax figures that they have in the windows explained Fred
It was in a place where they make them that Sam Hodge worked and he made us all laugh when we took him on at Henderson Harbor
He was telling us about the boss throwing his leg at him and Sam told us he fired a foot back and before he had gone very far we had the air full of eyes heads and legs and arms feet and hands and everything else that goes to the making of a dummy
In fact I have almost come to believe that Sam is pretty well made up himself
When he comes down tomorrow Im going to ask him to let me take out his eyes take off his hair pull out a foot and an arm and when he gets through Ill see just how much there is of the real Sam anyway
The boys laughed as Fred pictured the condition in which the loquacious Sam would be left
Their interest however was still great in the exciting events through which they recently had passed
Mr Button was an interested listener and when the story had been all told he said quietly Mr Stevens has been down here several summers
I have been afraid of that girl every year
If she doesnt find herself in the bottom of the river some time soon I dont believe the fault will be hers
Why whats the matter with her
inquired Fred
Shes too much of a tomboy
Whats that
inquired Grant winking at the other boys as he spoke
Why she does most of the things that the boys do
She plays tennis shoots a rifle paddles a canoe and manages the Stevens family
And that is why you call her a tomboy
inquired Fred
Yes sir it is said the old gentleman solemnly
Girls didnt act that way when I was young
How did they act
Why they were taught to be ladylike
And what is ladylike
asked Fred
Why it is to act like a lady
Yes protested Fred but why shouldnt a lady do these things youre speaking of
Because they are not ladylike replied Mr Button testily
But why arent they
persisted Fred
I dont see
Thats because you havent learned any sense yet said his grandfather irritated at last by the failure of his grandson to agree to all that he had said
Fred laughed goodnaturedly for behind the manner of his grandfather he knew there was a heart that was big and generous
Mr Button occasionally stormed about the present generation being so markedly different and deficient in all the good qualities that marked the young people of his own younger days
What about that bond
inquired John
Have you heard anything more about it
Not a word said Mr Button sharply
Before the old gentleman turned away however for Fred suspected that the subject was not a welcome topic of conversation he said quickly Wheres the man that wanted the bond
How should I know
retorted his grandfather
Has he been back here
No sir he hasnt
Do you know where he is
Im not sure if I did that I should tell you
But you said he went to Syracuse
If I did thats probably where he went
Yes said Fred still persisting in asking questions but you dont say whether he is coming back or not
Thats quite true
Is he coming
I cannot tell you
Dont you know
Did any one ever hear such a pestiferous child
said Mr Button laughing as he spoke
His questions and his tongue run like a milltail
Whats a milltail
inquired Fred
There he goes again
said Mr Button holding up both hands in mock despair
But I want to know whether or not you have been up to Cape Vincent to do anything about that bond demanded Fred
The bond isnt registered in my name anyway answered Mr Button
Probably I couldnt get it if I wanted to
But you dont answer my question
Go into the house now and get ready for dinner
If you havent any plans made for tomorrow I may ask you to take me up to Cape Vincent in the Black Growler
Of course well take you said Fred
We should like nothing better
Then its understood that tomorrow well go to Cape Vincent
But Grandfather said Fred before he went upstairs Susie Stevens and Mildred think they will want to go with us tomorrow
And you told them they might
Yes sir
Well I dont see then but what youll have to keep your promise though you mark my words young man youll be sorry you took that tomboy along with you
Shell get you into trouble just as sure as the sun rises
You mark my words
Fred laughed and as he went to his room he had no thought how nearly his grandfathers words were to be fulfilled the following day
CHAPTER XVIII A TEST Early the following morning when the Go Ahead boys went down to the dock they found that Sam Hodge already had arrived and was busily at work on the Black Growler
Good morning Sam called Fred deeply interested in the sight of the investigation which Sam was making 
Mornin called Sam without looking up from his task
How do you find everything on the boat
I havent only seen a few things yet retorted Sam
Ill tell you later what I think about it
Did you bring along any extra legs or arms
asked George
Nothin much replied Sam
His manner however to the boys seemed to imply that he was holding some information in reserve and this fact at once increased their curiosity
What have you got
asked George
I have nothin much but an albuminoid rib
What kind of a rib
Thats what you call it
If it isnt that its alkali
What kind of a rib is an alkali rib
asked John
Why its one of those things thats about as light as paper
Here Ill show it to you he added as he drew from his inner pocket a metal rib which he at once handed to Fred
That looks like aluminum to me said Fred quickly
Thats just what I said retorted Sam
I thought Id bring it along in case anything happened
Ill have some feet and hands comin later
What for
laughed Fred
What do you spose theyre for
Theyre for you to wear
If you had brought along a head said Grant solemnly it might have been a good thing
I have known Fred to lose his several times
We dont furnish brains we just use them said Sam as he restored the rib to his pocket
Now then he added Im goin to give this here boat an overhaulin from stem to stern
There isnt anything wrong is there
inquired Fred anxiously
I told you I cant say yet answered Sam
I dont know until I have investigated
Cant expect much when a lot of harem scarem boys are driving such a machine as this is
Had any more trouble since I left you
We havent had any answered Fred
We helped pull a couple of girls out of the river yesterday
What was they doing in the river
demanded Sam looking up for the first time since the arrival of the boys
What most people usually do when they cant swim answered Fred
What was the trouble
asked Sam
The chief trouble was said Grant solemnly that they did not have any alkali heads
Their heads were made of bone and were solid all the way through
The worst of it is broke in Fred that they said we were to blame for spilling them into the river
Maybe you were said Sam
One never knows
Maybe they saw you trying to steer this boat
Thats it
Thats it exactly spoke up George quickly
I hadnt thought before why those girls were spilled out of the canoe
I dont wonder they wanted to drown themselves when they saw the way Fred steered
Thats all right retorted Fred as his friends all laughed
Well take the Growler out this morning and see how she behaves
Thats what Sam wants to do I know
He cant tell how she runs until he sees her in action
Besides my grandfather wants to go up to Cape Vincent and we promised to take those girls along
Better not said Sam quickly
I should think you had had experience enough
Dont you know that every sailor says that it is bad luck to bring a woman aboard ship
The girls werent on board
If they had been there wouldnt have been any trouble asserted Fred
Well go up and get your breakfast said Sam and by the time youre ready I guess well start
The Black Growler stopped at the dock of the Stevens and after waiting a halfhour Miss Susie and her friend appeared and took their seats on board the motorboat
Mr Button was not enthusiastic in his morning salutations evidently sharing in Sams superstition that ill luck might follow the reception of their visitors
Apparently the boys were not alarmed however and in a brief time the Black Growler sped forward on her way and the sounds of laughter that came from her occupants were not indicative that trouble of any kind was greatly feared
Grandfather said Fred I would like to try the boat today over the course or at least over part of the course that well have to run in that race
Well if you want to try it broke in Sam who was steering the boat why dont you
There isnt anything to prevent you that I know
All right then we will said Fred
Well run up to Cape Vincent first and on our way back well try out the course a little
Maybe well try only one leg of it Only one what
broke in Sam abruptly looking back at the boys as he spoke
Oh its not an albuminoid rib Sam its just one leg of the course
They dont have any artificial legs in such places
You never can tell what will happen said Sam youd better bring one along
Why dont we try out the leg that well have to follow when we go up the river anyway
inquired John
Part of the course will be up stream and we might as well try that out now as any time
Is she in shape for trying it
inquired Mr Button of Sam
I havent tried yet said Sam cautiously
Then you never will know until you try laughed Mr Button
When we strike the beginning let her go for a little while anyway and well see how she works out
In a brief time the swiftly moving Black Growler arrived near the spot which Fred had been informed would form one of the points in the triangular course over which the race was to take place
I guess you have got some friends that want to try out the course too suggested Sam pointing as he spoke to a motorboat apparently of the same size as the Black Growler
Instantly glancing in the direction indicated by Sam the Go Ahead boys discovered the Varmint II nearby and from her actions it was plain that she too was planning to test the course
Make her show what she can do
said George eagerly a demand in which Miss Susie quickly joined
Thats right she exclaimed
I just love to go fast
You cant make the Black Growler move too fast to suit me
The two boats now were following parallel lines although they were more than one hundred feet apart
It was manifest also that the crew of the rival boat were aware of the purpose in the minds of the Go Ahead boys and that they also were not unwilling to discover what one of their rivals might be able to do in the coming race
Conversation ceased as suddenly the Black Growler darted forward almost as if she was a thing alive
The Varmint II started at the same moment and an impromptu race was on
The bow of the Black Growler at times seemed almost to be lifted above the river
Dashes of water when the bow again struck were driven into the faces of all on board
The spray soon made the cockpit as wet as if a stream of water had been played upon it
The noise of the engine the splash of the water the rushing river the white and excited faces as well as the anxiety with which the Go Ahead boys watched the speed of their rival all combined to increase the prevailing excitement
Apparently the two boats were moving almost neck and neck
We dont seem to gain on her Sam shouted Fred
Sam turned and glared upon the boy but did not reply to the suggestion
He was giving his entire attention to the task of steering the boat glancing occasionally at his rival which tenaciously was holding to its course
Several steamboats were passed and as the sight of the racing boats was seen there was a wild rush of the passengers to the rail to watch the contest
For twenty minutes the unexpected race continued
At the expiration of that time the Varmint II changed her course
Veering to the left she swerved in a wide semicircle saluting the Black Growler several times as she turned her course backward
I guess that will be some race said Miss Susie Stevens
I think Ill go with you
You think youll what
demanded Mr Button sharply
I just said that I thought I would be one of the crew of the Black Growler in the race
Excuse me young lady said Mr Button solemnly
That will be no place for a lady
Why not
demanded Miss Susie unabashed
All you have to do is to look at yourself now retorted Mr Button somewhat tartly
Youre soaked youre dripping from your head to your heels
I dont mind a little thing like that
Well you ought to whether you do or not
When I was your age the girls didnt go in for racing
Then they never knew what they lost
No they didnt know what they lost said Mr Button quietly
I guess they were better if they were not better off
Oh youll enjoy having me about Mr Button said Miss Susie
You need all the help you can get and Fred says hes going to steer in the race
Hell want me close by to tell him just what to do
If you speak to mo while Im steering the boat in that race spoke up Fred Im afraid youll find yourself where you and Mildred were yesterday when the Black Growler came along
The fearless girl laughed derisively but as the impromptu contest now was ended conversation turned to other topics
The speed under which the Black Growler was moving was somewhat diminished but the motorboat still was sweeping swiftly on its course
I hope well get there in time for luncheon exclaimed Miss Susie at last breaking in upon the silence that had followed her conversation with Freds grandfather
Thats another thing said Mr Button that I dont approve
Whats that
inquired Miss Susie
Luncheon
Doesnt it make you hungry to ride on the river
When I was young said Mr Button the girls didnt gorge themselves and many a time I have seen my sisters even at a formal dinner eat only enough to enable them to follow the courses
Yes and afterwards said Miss Susie who was unterrified by the gloomy remarks of the old gentleman they used to go behind the pantry doors and eat pickles and lots of other indigestible things
I dont wonder that they had such frightful color
But they didnt have such frightful color as you are pleased to call it said Mr Button
When they were exposed to the sunlight they wore veils and protected themselves
And afterwards said the girl they died of consumption
Now honestly Mr Button didnt some of these girls that youre speaking about die when they were young
Death is no respector of persons
He cuts down the young as well as the old
Do you mean that for an answer to my question
The conversation which was becoming slightly heated abruptly ceased when George excitedly called the attention of his companions to a man standing on the dock in Cape Vincent which they were rapidly approaching
Theres your bond man he said in a low voice
Instantly the eyes of all were turned toward the individual to whom George had referred
One look was sufficient to convince all the Go Ahead boys that George had spoken truly and that the man before them was indeed the one who had demanded that the bond which the boys had discovered on board should be given to him
CHAPTER XIX THE LOST FISH You come with me Freddie said Mr Button
Freds face flushed at the term applied to him by his grandfather and still deeper color appeared in his cheeks when he saw a mischievous expression appear in the eyes of the girls
To be called by the name be which he was called when he was a little fellow or at least very much smaller than he was at the present time was the last thing that could be applied him in the way of teasing
Mr Button however had no thought of annoying his grandson and used the term simply because it had been familiar to him from the time when Fred was born
Goodby Freddie goodby called the three Go Ahead boys together as their comrade obediently followed the call and at once joined his grandfather and the man who had demanded the bond and turned into the street
That fellow was waiting for us exclaimed George in surprise
I believe that Mr Button knew all the time that he was to be here
Well what do you make of it
inquired Grant
I dont know what to make of it
That man and a lot of his friends from the canalboats force their way on board the Black Growler and leave only when they are scared by the coming of the Caledonia
Then the first thing we know he shows up here at Cape Vincent and orders us to give up a bond which he says we have
And the worst of it is that we have it said George ruefully
HAD it you mean suggested Grant soberly
Thats right joined in John
We gave it up and had it recorded in Freds name
Now I suspect that those two men somehow have put up a job on Fred and that well lose our bond
 Our bond is good scoffed George
Well whose is it
demanded John
Thats what we dont know but that doesnt mean that everything we see which may be the property of somebody we dont know belongs to us
Well if this Mr Somebody owns that bond why doesnt he come and claim it
retorted John
Its my opinion that Mr Somebody has come said Grant dryly
What do you mean
inquired George
I dont know that I mean anything
Im thinking though that the man who owns that bond if it is good for anything isnt going to rest easily until he finds out where it is
Do you think that boatman owns it
asked John
Its plain that he knows something about it answered Grant
Meanwhile the two girls in the party were becoming somewhat impatient
My nobody knows how thirsty I am
said Miss Susie who had been an interested listener and for some strange reason had not joined in the conversation
Plenty of water around here suggested John
I dont mean that said the girl quickly
I mean something cold
And frozen
asked John
My how quick witted you are
laughed the girl
Thats exactly what we want
I suppose we might as well give in first as last said George in mock despair
If anybody knows where we can get any ice cream well start
Well start anyway spoke up Miss Susie
If we start we shall find it
Evidently success attended the efforts to locate the ice cream parlors for long before the return of the boys and girls to the Black Growler Fred and his grandfather had come back the latter becoming more impatient with the failure of the young people to appear
Sam Hodge meanwhile had been busily engaged in his inspection of the machinery of the Black Growler
When his task was completed he did not make any remarks but his face apparently beamed with satisfaction
Sam said Fred what do you think our chances are against that Varmint II
 Gainst the which
demanded Sam
That motorboat that we were racing
I think it will depend somewhat on how fast we go said Sam
What a wise man you are laughed Fred
I might have thought of that myself if I had tried hard
Do you think we can beat that boat
Thats what I want to know
I think we can if we go faster than she does replied Sam
Well can we make her go faster
You can if the speed is in her
Well do you think the speed is in her
I cant say just yet said Sam who was not to be moved from his cautious position
Here come your friends he added as the boys and girls were seen approaching the dock
Mr Button grumbled over the delay which had been caused by the failure of the young people to return but as no one except Fred understood just what he was saying slight attention was paid him
Meanwhile at Sams command the engine was started and the Black Growler free from the dock once more soon was noisily and speedily making her way down the mighty river
Why didnt you beat that other boat
demanded Miss Susie of Fred
That wasnt what we were trying to do
Well what were you trying to do
demanded the girl
Testing our boat and at the same time trying to find out what time they could make in the Varmint II
Well did you find out
We found that she can go answered Fred somewhat dolefully
Sam here says that we can beat her if we can go faster than she does
Thats exactly what I say spoke up Sam
How many legs have you got Sam
asked George abruptly
Six answered Sam
Both girls looked up in surprise
Miss Susie said Hes a regular centipede
What does he mean
What do you mean Sam
said Fred
Miss Susie doesnt understand you
How many legs really have you got
I have told you once retorted Sam
I have got six here and about fifty in New York
The girls stared blankly at each other and then as the boys laughed Miss Susie said Whats the joke
No joke said Fred
Its just a fact
The attention of the party however was speedily attracted by the sight of a little boat that was approaching flying a white flag at the stern
Oh I know what that is said Miss Susie confidently
That means that somebody is sick on board and that they are signaling us to help them
Huh
grunted Mr Button
Thats not it responded George
Well what is it then
demanded the girl
It means that somebody on board has caught a muscallonge and they are bringing it in
If any boat catches one it usually puts straight for home and it isnt backward in letting the world know what has happened
Have they got the fish with them
Why dont you ask them
laughed George handing the girl a megaphone as he spoke
Quickly taking her place on the deck Miss Susie shouted Have you got a muscallonge
Yes replied somebody on board
Hold it up and let us see it
In response a man on the other boat held forth to view a huge fish which weighed at least twentyfive pounds
Good for you
Good for you
shouted the Go Ahead boys together
Hold it up higher called Miss Susie
Is that a real fish
Did you really catch it or did you buy it somewhere
A reply was not given the questions for suddenly the great fish slipped from the hands of the man who was holding it and with a splash it fell into the water
Thats right grunted Mr Button
I told you what was going to happen
Why Mr Button exclaimed Miss Susie did you know beforehand that he was going to drop that fish
I told the boys before we started that they would surely have trouble today
Now stop this boat Sam Hodge he added
We have got to help those people get that fish in
I guess they wont need any help said Sam who was watching the efforts of the men on the other boat
Its speed had been checked as soon as the accident had occurred and the two men on board quickly began to pull in the two skiffs which they had in tow
In a brief time they took their places on board one of the little boats and with long strokes started swiftly back in their search for their lost prize
Fortunately the men soon found the floating muscallonge which now had been dead two hours
Eagerly they drew the fish into their skiff and when they returned to their motorboat they were aware for the first time that the Go Ahead boys were there to help
Few remarks however were made and as soon as the muscallonge had been restored to its place both boats continued on their way
Im afraid muttered Mr Button that isnt the last thing that is going to happen today
I hope not said Miss Susie lightly
Apparently all the efforts of Freds grandfather to subdue the lighthearted girl were doomed to failure
Why his prejudice against her had become so strong it was difficult even for Fred to understand although he was familiar with the peculiar ways of Mr Button
Look yonder
suddenly exclaimed John Thats the Varmint II again
Coming around the end of a nearby island the swift little motorboat was seen approaching
Taking his megaphone Fred shouted Come on well try it again
We couldnt do much this morning
All right came back the answering hail from the Varmint II and in a brief time both boats were swiftly moving down the river
Again the spray dashed over each party the water through which they were passing again seemed to be moved as if by some intense heat beneath it
The noise of the motor and the sound of the rushing water made it difficult for the Go Ahead boys to hear one another
There was slight disposition however to talk for all on board the little boat were eagerly watching their rival
Although there were no sure grounds for their belief the Go Ahead boys were confident that the strongest rival they would face in the coming race was the boat which now was only a few yards distant
And what a beautiful little structure she was
Her lines were all graceful and as she slipped through the water she seemed almost to share in the prevailing excitement
Steadily the two boats continued on their way neither apparently being able to gain much upon its rival
Occasionally the Varmint II led by a few feet only to lose the advantage as the Black Growler slowly drew ahead
Evidently they were evenly matched
This fact however served only to increase the interest of the Go Ahead boys
When at last the Varmint II again turned from the course and with a wide sweep started across the river there had been no sure test of the comparative speed of the two boats
What do you think Sam
inquired Fred anxiously
Can we beat her
We can if we go faster than she does replied Sam briefly
CHAPTER XX SAMS WARNING The thought of the race which was to take place within a few days and in which both the Black Growler and the Varmint II were to be contestants was in the mind of every one
In spite of the unwillingness of Sam to express his opinion as to the outcome Fred insisted repeatedly upon asking what he thought
Again and again Sam evaded a direct reply as in one form or another he explained that all he did know was that the Black Growler would win if she could run more swiftly than the Varmint II
As to the possibility of developing the required speed he was noncommittal
Conversation did not lag on the voyage down the river
The presence of Mr Button as well as the fact that Fred apparently was somewhat reserved and uncommunicative concerning his recent experiences in Cape Vincent caused the Go Ahead boys to neglect the topic of conversation which just then was uppermost in their thoughts
Time did not drag however and it was a merry party on the motorboat which attracted the attention of many of the parties they met
In the most informal manner salutes were given and whistles were tooted whenever boats large or small passed
In spite of Miss Susies apparent carelessness she had provided a most excellent luncheon to which ample justice had been done by all on board including Mr Button
It was late in the afternoon however when the two girls were left at their cottage and the Black Growler sped forward toward Chestnut Island
As soon as a landing was made Mr Button at once started for the cottage
Left to themselves Freds three friends quickly turned upon him and eagerly began to question him concerning his experiences at Cape Vincent
Wheres your man that wanted the bond
demanded George
Did you get the bond
asked Grant
Did you find out who that fellow is
inquired John
Hold on fellows laughed Fred
Ill take you one at a time but I dont want you all together
Now then speak up one of you
What is it you want to know
Did you find out who that man is
asked John
I fancy youre referring to the gentleman who requested us to deliver to him that five thousand dollar bond
answered Fred
You catch my meaning exactly answered John solemnly
Well then let me say that he is just as big a mystery to me as he is to you
Did he get the bond
demanded Grant
I dont know
Werent you with him
I was but not all the time
Did he go to the bank
He certainly did
Werent you there too
Couldnt you see whether they gave him the bond or not
Not being able to see through a foot wall and a door still stronger I am unable to give you the information you so courteously request
What do you mean
Cant you speak in plain English
Ill do my best laughed Fred who so often had been the object of attention from his friends that now he was rejoiced that in a measure at least the tables were turned
Well we were at the bank he continued
My grandfather told me to stay outside while he went into Mr Reeses office
They were in there about five minutes and then Mr Reese came out and asked me to tell our canalboat friend that his presence was desired in the office so I went outside the bank and found the man they were looking for gave him the message and then I went back
Didnt they want you in the office too
inquired John
I didnt receive any strong urging to enter laughed Fred so I decided it was better for me to stay outside
How long were they in there
inquired Grant
I suppose it was about half an hour but it seemed a good deal longer
Who came out first
The canalman
Was he alone
Yes
How long before any one else came out
Five minutes anyway perhaps ten
What did your friend do
He went out of the bank and thats the last I saw of him
You dont know then whether he went to the hotel or the station or came down the river
I have told you just what I know and all I know
I cant do any more
So were just as wise as we were when we began laughed George
We dont know what has become of our bond nor where the man that wanted it went
We dont even know whether or not it is in the bank yet
Dont begin on the list of things you dont know George said Fred soberly
Itll take too much time
Its a good thing to know that you dont know
Some people that dont know dont know that they dont know
Now I know some things and among the things I know I know that I dont know some things that I think I know
The Go Ahead boys laughed as they all started toward the cottage to prepare for dinner
The following morning Fred and George were the first to dress and together they made their way once more to the boathouse
In a room above the slip in which the graceful little motorboat was resting Sam Hodge was found
He had arisen two hours before this time and already had eaten his breakfast and was preparing for the duties of the coming day
It was because of Sams own choice that the room he occupied had been assigned him
And what a strange room it was
Sam had brought many of his own belongings among which were various pictures of the human anatomy both external and internal
A lifesize dummy stood in one corner of the room the expression on its face being almost human in its dolefulness
In other parts of the room were legs arms feet and hands in various stages of completion
Sam explained that his love for the work which he did in the winter when he was employed in the factory on Broome Street New York was present with him throughout the year
Yes I like fooling around a boat in the summer time he explained but you cant do that when the ice is about two feet thick
And yet if I go back to New York then I am all out of practice with my feet and legs and arms so the only thing for me to do is to keep in the game
Besides I like it and what a fellow likes to do isnt work its play
Im finishing up that dummy explained Sam to the boys when they entered
One arm is a bit too long and one of the feet ought to have a number four shoe and the other about a number nine
I have seen people that way but not very often
I should think you would wake up in the night with the nightmare laughed George
I think I should if I looked out and saw somebody over in the corner of the room still staring and silent
Yes some folks is easily scared acknowledged Sam
Ive been over to Alexandria Bay he added
When
inquired Fred quickly
Oh I guess Ive been over two or three times
Ive been asking some questions about those men that run the Varmint II
What did you find out about them
inquired both boys eagerly
Accordin to what I heard they arent much good
What do you mean
Why I think they are a tough lot said Sam shaking his head
The two fellows that own the boat are both of them sons of very rich men who give them all the money they want to use
It hasnt done the youngsters any good I guess from what I heard
They bought the motorboat expecting that there wouldnt be anything on the river that could touch her
They say they are pretty sore now that they have found that there is a boat which may give them a hard rub and perhaps take the cup away from them after all
Sam if you win that race for us began Fred eagerly
Im not going to win your race broke in Sam
Ive heard you say that youre going to do the steering yourself and if you are why the only thing I can do is to be a sort of court of appeals
Ill be there to help you out if something goes wrong
Now were up against a pretty serious proposition
Those fellows are bound to win that race and if they cant win it one way they are goin to win it another
I dont see how they can win Sam if they dont go faster than we do
Maybe they can win suggested Sam if we go slower than they do
Thats the same thing laughed George
Not by a jugful
Why isnt it
Why they may not be goin so very fast and yet if our boat isnt in good shape it may be that theyll keep ahead of us and beat us
Well thats just what youre here for said Fred to see that nothing does happen to us or to our boat
Are you goin to take them girls along that you had yesterday
inquired Sam abruptly
Do you mean in the race
asked Fred
What did you think I meant
Well were not going to take them
Then maybe therell be a chance to win out
I wouldnt promise anything with them on board especially one of them
Shes all right but she would want to steer the boat and talk to the crew when it might be that the whole race was dependin on what we were doin right then and there
No you can rest easy about that said Fred
There wont be anybody on board except the Go Ahead boys and you
Well then said Sam if thats the case then well have to keep a sharp watch on the Black Growler
Sams manner more than the words he spoke impressed the boys with the fact that he was holding back something that he had heard or knew concerning the possibilities of trouble for the swift little motorboat
Just what they were neither Fred nor George could conjecture
Their confidence in Sam was great and when they departed from the boathouse they made light of his fears
Sam is a regular old kill joy laughed George
There has to be somebody said Fred to take the joy out of life
It wouldnt be worth living if that wasnt so
Well Sam does his best said George with a laugh and the only reason why he doesnt succeed is because his bark is worse than his bite
We know he doesnt mean half he says
But why does he seem so worried about something happening to the Black Growler
Oh I dont know said George
Thats just one of his notions I guess
It was not long however before both boys were excitedly aware that Sams forebodings had been based upon a knowledge greater than that possessed by any of the Go Ahead boys
CHAPTER XXI THE SUMMONS IN THE NIGHT On each of the three days that followed the Black Growler was sent over a part of the course which had been mapped out for the race
The speed of the marvelous little motorboat apparently was satisfactory to all concerned except Sam
He growled and protested that there was something wrong with the boat and declared that unless they kept a careful watch other things that would be still worse might occur
On several occasions an impromptu race was had with the Varmint II
It was plain to the occupants of each boat that their rival was dangerous
Fred became more anxious with the passing days sometimes being low spirited and declaring that there was no hope for the Black Growler
He was easily routed out of his despondency however for it has been well said that it is not difficult for men to believe the things which they wish to believe
Well be all right said George confidently
There wouldnt be any fun in a race if the other boat did not have some speed in her
But you just wait Fred and well show that Varmint II a clean pair of heels
I hope so said Fred his courage quickly rising again
By the way Fred said John you never told us any more about that man who came for the bond
I havent any more to tell said Fred quietly
Now look here Peewee spoke up Grant
That bond wasnt yours
It belonged to the Go Ahead boys
I dont see why you assume all the rights of ownership
I dont protested Fred
The bond was registered in my name at the bank and so I had to go with my grandfather to see about it
Did that canalman steal the bond
asked John
I cant tell you replied Fred
Do you mean you cant or you wont tell
A little of both laughed Fred eager to change the subject
Throughout these conversations Sam Hodge seldom spoke
Indeed as the time drew nearer the day of the race his anxiety manifestly increased
He was busy on or about the boat throughout the day and even when night fell it was difficult to persuade him to retire to his room in the boathouse
Once when Fred looked out of his bedroom window in the moonlight night about twelve oclock he discovered Sam pacing back and forth on the dock
Just why he was so uneasy Fred did not understand and Sam did not offer any explanation
On the following night not long after the boys had retired they were awakened by a loud call from Sam Hodge
Hi
Hi there
he shouted
Come out here
Hastily donning their clothing the boys ran out of the house and quickly joined Sam who had leaped into a skiff that had been fastened to the dock and was now rowing swiftly toward the head of the island
What is it Sam
called Fred
Sam however made no response and soon disappeared from sight around the bend in the shore
What do you suppose the trouble is
inquired John
Im telling you said George that Sam has seen something that surprised him
He has been saying all the while that he was afraid something might happen to the Black Growler
But nothing can happen to her tonight
Its perfectly clear
Theres no storm and even Sam did not think it was worth while to run her into the boathouse
That may be just the trouble suggested Grant
I dont know what you mean retorted George quickly turning upon his friend
What might happen
The thing that Sam seemed to be afraid of
But what is that
Sam hasnt told me
Thats all so spoke up Fred but Sam has some reason for being worried
I dont know what it is and I think he ought to tell us
Maybe he will when he comes back suggested George
Back from where
retorted John scornfully
Hes just started and nobody knows where he is going or when he is coming back
He will be here within a few minutes said Grant confidently
True to Grants suggestion not many minutes had elapsed before Sam was seen approaching
He was rowing leisurely and apparently was neither alarmed nor excited
As soon as he came within speaking distance Fred called sharply What is it Sam
Did you see anything
inquired Sam as he rested on his oars a few yards from the dock
Nothing except you answered Fred
We saw you pulling as if your life depended upon it
It wasnt my life exactly said Sam slowly but there was a man here on the dock
A man
exclaimed George
Who was he
What was he doing here
Thats exactly what I should like to know myself said Sam shortly
I was trying to find out and that was just the reason why I followed him
Didnt you see any one
Fred asked
Yes sir I did replied Sam
What was he doing
inquired John
I saw a skiff headed for Alexandria Bay
How many were in it
Two men
What were they doing
The last I saw of them they were pulling as if for dear life
That was why I couldnt catch them
And you think they were here on our dock
I do explained Sam promptly
I saw one man on the dock
Probably the other was in the skiff
What were they doing
Nothing when I first saw them
They were just getting ready to do it
Do what
demanded George
I guess its time for you boys to go back to your beds said Sam after a brief silence
If you cant tell then Im not going to explain
Tell us Sam just what happened pleaded Fred
For a moment the man was silent and then as if thinking better of his resolution he said The fact is boys there was some one in the boathouse
I was sure of it though I couldnt see any one
I heard him moving around and when I came out on the dock there I saw him just as plain as day
Just about that time he saw me too and that was the first I knew that there were two of them one in the skiff and one on the dock
Were they near the Black Growler
inquired Fred who was keenly aroused by the story Sam was telling
They couldnt have been nearer declared Sam but when they saw me they started out as if the evil one was after them
I dont wonder suggested George
Huh
said Sam quickly
Whats that you say
I think it would scare anybody if he thought you were trying to catch him said George glibly
Mollified by the explanation Sam continued They lighted out as soon as they both were in the skiff and the way they rowed was something marvelous
I chased them around the point but if youll believe me when I got there they were already more than halfway to Alexandria Bay
They must have traveled fast laughed John
They didnt delay any let me tell you said Sam shaking his head
And they had good reason to hurry up
Was anything wrong with the boat
asked Fred
I havent found out yet
I dont think they had time to do much harm
What makes you think they wanted to harm the boat anyway
asked Grant
Huh said Sam turning abruptly upon the speaker
What else could they want here
I dont know that they would want anything said Grant quietly
When you have made up your mind that somebody is trying to put the Black Growler out of business it is easy for you to believe that everything is working for that one thing
You dont know as much as you might said Sam tartly
By which you mean
inquired Grant
By which I mean just this responded Sam warmly
The people that own the Varmint II are a tough crowd
They are some young fellows that have got more money than they have sense
More dollars than cents you mean dont you
interrupted George
Thats what I said retorted Sam
They are betting all sorts of money on their boat
From what I heard over at the Bay they have staked more money than you would believe on their boat winning the race
Who told you about it
inquired Fred
Never you mind that said Sam
I know and thats enough
Now if theyve got so much staked they wouldnt feel so very bad would they if anything happened to the Growler
It seems shes the only boat they are afraid of anyway and if she isnt in the race why the Varmint II will just walk away with the cup
And do you really think inquired Fred that they will try to damage our boat so that she cant be in the race
Im not saying THEY will answered Sam but somebody might
Perhaps they wouldnt know anything about it
Do you think those men who were here tonight came to do that
Im suspicious said Sam but I dont know yet how much damage they did
I called you because I thought I might need your help
There isnt anything more you can do now and you might as well go back to bed
With the coming of the day most of the fears and anxieties of the boys departed
The alarm of Sam the preceding night appeared very differently now and they even were inclined to laugh at him for his fears
Sam however had fallen once more into one of his periods of silence and made no comment on the remarks of the Go Ahead boys
Im going over to the Bay now said Sam when the boys after breakfast approached the dock
Are you going in the motorboat
inquired Fred
Yes sir
How long will you be there
I dont know
Probably an hour
Then well go over with you answered Fred
Perhaps well find one of these fellows who were trying to blow up the Black Growler last night
Im not saying they were trying to blow her up retorted Sam
You dont have to blow up a boat to put it out of commission do you
Her machinery is so fine that it wouldnt take very much damage to one part to throw the whole thing out of gear
Thats true said George but I dont believe Sam that theres need for our being scared
Probably those two men you saw last night were just stopping on their way back to the Bay from some of the islands
Sam shook his head and although he did not speak his action implied that the Go Ahead boys might soon be wiser than they were at that time
Nor was his suspicion misplaced
Not many hours had elapsed before they were almost as strong as Sam in their belief that the Black Growler was not only an object of dislike but also that there was a real peril that she might be so injured that it would be impossible for her to enter the race
CHAPTER XXII A COLLISION In a brief time the Black Growler was fast to one of the sidedocks and the party prepared to disembark
Im not going to leave that boat without somebody stayin on board asserted Sam positively when he was aware that the Go Ahead boys were all planning to accompany him
What are you afraid of
inquired George
Theres some one around here all the time and no one could do any damage without being seen
It doesnt make any difference asserted Sam
A man might drop sand into the bearings or grease cups or do some other mean trick and nobody ever see him
All right then laughed George Ill be the goat
Ill stay here while youre gone
I guess I shant be lonesome he added with a laugh as he glanced at the increasing assembly which already had been drawn to the dock to gaze at the beautiful little motorboat
Soon after the departure of his friends George seated himself in the stern of the boat and did his utmost to appear indifferent to the admiring glances and words of approval which now were coming from the spectators
He had secured a copy of the morning paper and was pretending to be interested in the news he was reading
Suddenly he partly dropped the paper as in the crowd he discovered the canalman who had demanded their bond at Cape Vincent
For some reason which George was unable to understand he did not advance to the boat preferring to remain on the outskirts of the little assembly
The fact however that the man was there was in itself somewhat startling
Still pretending to be interested in his paper George did his utmost to follow the actions of the man whom he had discovered but not many minutes had elapsed before he departed from the dock
When his friends returned the strange man had not come back
Did anything happen
inquired Fred eagerly as he stepped on board
What did you think was going to happen
answered George somewhat evasively
I didnt think anything was laughed Fred
Sam is the only one who is worried
Well he has some right to be worried I guess said George slowly
Why whats wrong
What happened
demanded Fred excitedly
Are you ready to explain what you did with that bond that belongs to the Go Ahead boys
asked George slowly
No sir Im not
Then youll not be interested in the fact that the man who wanted it came down here to the dock while you were gone
He did
He did
exclaimed Fred so eagerly that his friends all laughed
What did he want
That sir I cant explain to you at this time answered George striving to mimic the tones and manner of his friend
Its difficult for me to tell the whole story unless I know what you all have to say
I have nothing to say retorted Fred
Neither have I responded George glibly
Meanwhile Sam had cast off and with his boathook had pushed the Black Growler out into the stream
The graceful lines of the motorboat were more distinctly seen now and the enthusiasm of the spectators was somewhat noisily expressed
At that moment however the Varmint II came sweeping in a great semicircle toward the dock and the attention of the assembly was quickly divided
The boys were able to overhear the comparisons which were made some of them favorable to one boat and some to the other
The Go Ahead boys however were so deeply interested in the sight of their rival that they gave slight heed to the comments
They were keenly watching the young men on board but in a few minutes they were beyond the sight of the dock and the Varmint II consequently no longer could be seen
I tell you Sam is right said George positively
Those fellows on that Varmint II are a hard crowd
If they have been betting as much money as Sam says they have it may be that theres some reason for his being afraid that some accident may happen to the Black Growler
It wouldnt do any harm to keep pretty close watch anyway suggested Grant
Whatever the weather is I think it will be better to run her into the boathouse every night and put double locks on the doors
Well do more than that said Sam
Well have somebody on the lookout
I guess it wouldnt be very much of a job for you boys to divide the night up into watches
Ill stay on duty until eleven or twelve oclock and from then on until six wouldnt take more than an hour and a half from each of you
Well do that said Fred quickly
Thats a good suggestion Sam
But if we have the Black Growler fast inside the boathouse how can any one get at her
inquired John
My dear String said Grant solemnly I fear now that the remark of that wise Englishman was correct when he said that Nature never built men seven stories high without the top lofts being left empty
I have heard you say that before retorted John irritated by the manner more than by the words of his friend
Well all I can say is said Grant if you have any gray matter up there where your brain ought to be located you had better begin pretty soon to make it work
If a man wanted to break into the boathouse he wouldnt have very much trouble in doing it no matter how many padlocks we put on the doors
Thats right spoke up George
He could dive under the doors or smash in the window or cut out a glass and if there wasnt any one on guard he might never be detected
No sir weve got to establish a guard and the fellow who is on duty must keep up a regular patrol
He must keep walking around the dock all the time
And there may be some other ways by which they will try to get at us besides injuring our boat suggested Grant
I dont see what spoke up John quickly
Its the one boat they are afraid of and if they can only put the Black Growler out of business they wont have anything to fear as far as the outcome of the race is concerned
What could they do anyway
Oh I dont know said Grant
I can think of a dozen tricks they might play any one of which might throw us out of the race
Grants words proved to be more prophetic than he had dreamed
That very afternoon after the boys had taken their daily run over a part of the triangular course where the great race was to be held an event occurred which confirmed his statement and added strength to Sams warning
The Black Growler already had finished her course and under low speed was moving with the current on her way back to the island where she belonged
Suddenly and without any warning whistle a swift little boat dashed out from behind one of the small islands which the Black Growler chanced to be passing at the time and almost before the boys were aware of what was occurring there was a collision
Look out
Look out there
shouted Fred who was steering in his loudest tones
At the same time he did his utmost to change the course of the motorboat
His words of warning however were either unheard or unheeded
There was a sharp collision for the smaller boat was moving swiftly
This was followed by the sound of a grinding crash
In dismay the Go Ahead boys ran to the side of their boat and speedily discovered that the metal bow of the little boat before them had cut a long gash which extended below the waters edge
Indeed it was only by an effort that the other boat was freed
To all appearances she was uninjured
On board were two men plainly belonging to the region
Whats the matter with you
called one of the men on the other boat
Whats the matter with YOU
retorted Fred
Why didnt you whistle before you turned the end of the island
How were we to know anything was there if you didnt let us know
You yourself ought to have whistled
The damage to the Black Growler however was not to be explained away by abuse or questions
Sam already in the skiff had brought it alongside and was inspecting the damage on the outside
As yet he had not made any suggestions and how serious the collision might prove to have been was not yet known
Meanwhile the other boat hastily withdrew and when the Go Ahead boys again looked up to discover where it was not one of them was able to find it
Thats a great note
exclaimed George in disgust
They not merely ram us but they dont wait nor even offer to help us
They didnt want to help grumbled Sam
The sooner they could get away from here the better
What do you mean
said Grant abruptly turning to face Sam as he spoke
It seems to me spoke up John that Nature doesnt have to make every fellow seven stories high to leave his topknot vacant
Sam thinks those fellows ran into us purposely
For a moment the Go Ahead boys stared blankly at one another
The suggestion of John in the light of what had occurred after the accident might be true
The men in the other boat were strangers to the boys not one of whom had ever seen either of them before
The silent manner in which the sharp little boat had come around the island also was suspicious
With redoubled anxiety the boys turned to Sam to discover how serious was the damage which had been inflicted
How do you find it Sam
called Fred anxiously
Are we out of the race
Sam shook his head as if he either was unwilling or unable as yet to reply
Meanwhile the Black Growler had been drifting with the current all power instantly having been shut off
Slight effort was required to keep her headed aright and Fred had remained at the wheel when Sam had begun his investigations
Conversation now ceased while all four boys anxiously awaited the results of Sams efforts to discover whether or not the Black Growler had suffered serious damage
CHAPTER XXIII THE CALL IN THE NIGHT The only announcement which Sam vouchsafed after he had completed his hasty inspection of the damage which had been done was I guess shell stand it all right as far as Alexandria Bay
Are you going to drift all the way Sam
inquired John
Drift
No
Im going ahead
Seems to me Ive heard some boys talk about goin ahead and now s the time to find out whether they mean business or not
Relieved by the manner of Sam although he had not made any positive statement the four Go Ahead boys eagerly watched him as under slow headway he carefully guided the swift little boat toward its destination
An hour afterward they arrived at Alexandria Bay
There Sam insisted once more upon the boys remaining on board while he sought the help he desired in repairing the Black Growler
While the boys were awaiting his return their conversation naturally turned upon the mishap which had befallen them and their anxiety concerning the outcome of the accident
Im telling you said John that I havent seen but one fellow on the Varmint II that was on board when I came up the Hudson with them
What has become of the others
inquired Fred
I dont know
I havent seen any of them
I remember that one particular fellow because he made me think when I saw him that there werent many things he would hesitate to do if he wanted to win pretty badly
Do you really think inquired George that this accident up here was not an accident at all
Do you honestly believe that they ran into us on purpose
Im not charging nobody with nothin as Sam says laughed John but its strange that boat didnt give any warning
They said that we didnt give any warning either spoke up Grant
Perhaps we were as much to blame as they were
Well if thats the only thing that happens to us said Fred I shant complain that is if the Black Growler isnt put out of the race
Youll have a good excuse Peewee laughed George if you lose the cup
Hows that
inquired Fred
Why you can charge it up to the collision
Im not going to charge it to anything but the boat retorted Fred sharply
If the Black Growler doesnt win it isnt going to be the fault of any one but herself
There comes Sam with two men he added as the boatman was seen approaching accompanied by two mechanics
Another inspection of the damaged boat was made by the men whom Sam had brought but their verdict coincided with his own
The Black Growler was marred but no serious damage had been done
Youre sure there isnt any leak are you
inquired Fred anxiously after the work was completed
Not a leak laughed one of the men
All the same spoke up Sam Im going to leave the boat here and Ill be back for her tonight
Dont let any one come near her and give her a thorough overhauling
The men readily consented and soon departed taking the Black Growler around the point to the spot where their boathouse was located
The Go Ahead boys and Sam then took their places in the two skiffs which the Black Growler had had in tow and in a brief time arrived at the dock on the island owned by Mr Button
Freds grandfather chanced to be in the boathouse when they arrived and in response to his inquiry concerning the motorboat Fred briefly related the story of the accident
Who was steering
demanded Mr Button sharply
Thats what comes of letting a lot of boys run such a delicate piece of work as that motorboat
I told your father Fred that he ought not to get you any such plaything as that
Ill warrant that you were steering and not paying any attention
Fred laughed as he said The fact is Grandfather that I was on the lookout but the other boat never whistled nor gave us any sign of their coming
Did you let them know that you were coming
Why no we didnt whistle
Then I dont see that you have any one to blame but yourselves said Mr Button tartly
Its just as I said
But were not so sure that it was an accident persisted Fred
No laughed Mr Button
I suppose you think that other boat was hiding behind the rock ready to jump out at you the way a pickerel starts for a minnow
If that was the only thing explained Fred we might agree with you
But the trouble is that were afraid somebody wants to injure the Black Growler
Why
demanded Mr Button turning abruptly upon the boys as he spoke
To put her out of the race
For a moment Mr Button stared blankly at his grandson and then said quietly Dont you believe it
We dont have that kind of people around here
I shall have to write your father that you were to blame
And Ill write him and tell him all about it said Fred angrily
See that you do
See that you do said his grandfather as he turned to the house and left the boys standing on the dock
All the same spoke up George Im sure that that collision wasnt any accident
What do you think Grant
I confess I dont know replied Grant
If it was the only thing that had happened I might think it was an accident but taken in connection with some other things we have found out Im almost afraid it wasnt
Then the only thing for us to do said John is to keep watch
Sam is going to bring the Black Growler back here tonight and some one of us will have to be on guard all the time
I have got that all fixed said Fred taking a slip of paper from his pocket as he spoke I have divided the night into five watches
Well let Sam stay on guard until eleven oclock
Ill take the watch from eleven P M to twelvethirty A M Grant can come on at twelvethirty and stay until two then George will take his place and stay until halfpast three
John will be the last one and he can be the guard from halfpast three until five o clock
There wont be any need of any one after that because it will be light by that time
Thats all right spoke up George
The only suggestion I have to make is that we rotate the hours if we keep this up many nights
What do you mean
inquired Fred
Why the one that comes on at eleven oclock one night comes on at twelvethirty the next night
The one who comes on at twelvethirty will report at two and so on
Well just keep pushing the schedule up every night so well all be the same when were done
How shall we know when our turns come
inquired John
Every fellow is to call the one who is to take his place
But suppose the villain comes between spells
Well have to take our chances on that said John
The proposed scheme was finally accepted
About six oclock Sam returned with the Black Growler and when the plan was explained to him he readily consented to accept the part which had been assigned to him
That night at eleven o clock he called Fred who was to have the first watch
After the first halfhour the young guard in the silence that rested over the great river found the time dragging heavily
In order to keep awake he walked about the dock peering intently in every direction
Not a sign of danger had been discovered however when at halfpast twelve he summoned Grant to take his place
Grant also was not molested and when he called George at two oclock he said sleepily It all seems like fool business anyway Pop
Youve been asleep retorted George
I havent closed my eyes retorted Grant sharply
If you do as well youll be lucky
A halfhour after George had entered upon his task he stopped and peered through the window into the boathouse
The light of the moon made many of the objects within clear and distinct
The Black Growler was lying peacefully in her slip
Apparently peril was nowhere threatening
Suddenly as George glanced at the farther end of the platform beside the slip he stopped abruptly and stepped quickly back from the window
Approaching the place again he cautiously peered within and his first impressions were confirmed
He was able to see distinctly the figure of a man crouching in a corner of the room
Instantly Georges heart was thumping wildly and he was tempted to shout to the intruder
Hastily banishing the impulse he watched the man
The dim outline of his figure was distinctly seen
Perhaps the intruder had been startled by the discovery of the face at the window
At all events he remained motionless and not a sound was heard save the lapping of the little waves against the dock
By this time Georges fears had returned in full force
He decided quickly to summon the Go Ahead boys and not attempt alone to drive away the intruder
That the mans purpose in coming was evil he had no question
What other explanation was to be had for the presence of a strange man in the boathouse at three oclock in the morning
Running silently and swiftly to the house George speedily summoned his friends who were wide awake as soon as the report of his discovery of the man in the boathouse was heard
Shall I take a gun
whispered Fred to his companion
No said Grant sharply
We dont want any gun
Well some of us ought to have clubs or something persisted Fred
I dont think we shall want anything said Grant but if youre afraid bring along two or three bats
These weapons were secured and then silently the four Go Ahead boys departed from the house and stealthily approached the boathouse in which George had discovered the presence of the intruder
CHAPTER XXIV THE MAN IN THE BOATHOUSE When the Go Ahead boys drew near the dock they separated George and Grant moving to one side of the boathouse while John and Fred approached from the opposite side
There were two large doors in the front of the boathouse both of which now were closed
The upper part of each however was of glass and was so made that the boys were able to stand on the dock and by leaning forward could peer into the building
Hes there whispered George excitedly after he had looked within
Quickly withdrawing Grant took his place and silently peered into the slip
At the same time John and Fred were making their investigations on the opposite side of the slip although Fred was having his difficulties because he was not tall enough to enable him to look through the glass
The man whom George had discovered apparently had not moved from the place in which he had first been seen
Perhaps he too was listening and was fearful of an attack
Their excitement now greatly intensified George beckoned for John and Fred to come to the place where he and Grant were standing on the dock
Hes there whispered Fred
I told you he was whispered George in reply
Now the question is how shall we get him
How did he get in
inquired Grant
I dont know replied George shaking his head
There isnt any window open and the doors are locked
He must have dived under the door and come up that way suggested John
This isnt any time to be discussing how he got there remarked George
The thing for us to do is to find out how we are going to get him out or get him
Lets go around to the window on the river side
In response to the suggestion the boys stealthily crept along the dock and then one after another cautiously peered through the window
Not one of them stood in full view of the man within for they were aware of the peril that might follow such an action
Hes still there whispered Fred and I dont believe he has moved once since we came back
Hes scared suggested John
He doesnt know which way to turn
The suggestion that the intruder might be alarmed was new to the Go Ahead boys and did much to revive their courage
John and George each had secured a bat when they had left the house
And now they were prepared to defend the motorboat and themselves also if the need arose
Knock on the window suggested Grant
Let the fellow know were here
He may get away warned George who still was the most excited of all
If he tries to well get him then anyway said Grant
Go around and look on the other side of the boathouse he directed Fred and John
Well wait here
Ill rap on the window and well see what he does
Grant waited until sufficient time had elapsed to enable his friends to take their position in front of the entrance on the opposite side and then rapped lightly upon the window
No response was made to his summons
He couldnt hear you whispered George
Youll have to make more noise than that
Again Grant rapped upon the glass pounding on the window sash also in his efforts to arouse the attention of the man within
All four boys now were keenly excited and all were eager to discover what the intruder would do now that his presence had been discovered
To their surprise the man did not respond to the summons
Even his position was unchanged and in the dim light the boys were unable to decide whether or not he had even glanced in the direction from which the hail had come
Theres only one thing we can do said George
Whats that
demanded Grant
Go around to the other side and tell Fred weve got to have the door unlocked
Then well make a rush on the fellow before he knows that we are after him
The suggestion was quickly followed and soon the four boys were standing together in front of the sidedoor which opened upon the dock
Now then said Fred who insisted upon retaining his key when I unlock the door all four of us must make a rush together
Thats right whispered George as he grasped more tightly the bat which he was holding in his hand
Let String and George go ahead
They are the best armed said Grant
For some reason Grant was less excited than his companions a fact which escaped the attention of the boys at that time
All ready
whispered Fred
Quickly turning the key he opened the door and together the four boys darted into the boathouse
Although the moon was shining the interior of the room was somewhat darker than it had been on the dock
The boys however were able to see clearly the man who was still standing near the Black Growler
Not even when they rushed upon him did he turn his face toward them
In their eagerness to secure him all four did their utmost to leap upon him at the same time
A most amazing result however followed their desperate attempt
Despite his efforts to save himself Fred who pluckily was in advance was pushed over the edge of the slip and with a loud splash fell into the river
Before he could check himself John followed his example
A yell came from Fred when he arose to the surface because at that moment the intruder whom they had discovered in the boathouse also followed the example set by the boys
Meanwhile George and Grant had broken into loud laughter
George was bowed and slapping his sides as he moved about the room
Grant was laughing almost as loudly as his companion although he did not move from the place where he was standing
Give us a hand called Fred
I cant see the ladder
Its right in front of you suggested George advancing to the edge and looking down into the water which was only about four feet below him
There it is
Follow the sound of my voice
I dont see what there is so funny about all this sputtered Fred as he climbed to the floor
Funny
exclaimed Grant
It beats anything I ever experienced
Whats the trouble
demanded John who now also had climbed out of the water
His elongated form only partly clothed his garments dripping and clinging to his slim body increased the weirdness of his appearance
I think the jokes on George more than even it is on Peewee and String laughed Grant
At this moment Sam who had been asleep in his room appeared rubbing his eyes and gazing in surprise at the boys
Whats wrong
he demanded gruffly
Nothing said George beginning to laugh again
It seems to me you make lots of fuss when nothin is the matter
What are you all down here for anyway
Why George got us down here to help him get a man who was in the boathouse
Huh whats that you say
Why George discovered somebody in the boathouse and he routed us all out to help him get him
Did you get him
inquired Sam
We got all there was to get laughed Grant
What do you mean
demanded Sam looking around the room and for the first time suspecting what had taken place
Why we mean that you had that wax figure of yours down here and we all thought it was a man
I dont blame you said Sam solemnly
Thats one of the best wax dummies I ever made
But why did you leave it where you did
inquired George
Why I figured it out this way said Sam slowly
If a scarecrow will keep crows out of a cornfield why couldnt I rig up something to scare off anybody that wanted to damage the Black Growler
Thats good sense said Grant soberly
Of course it is sense declared Sam
I put the dummy down there so that if anybody looked into the boathouse he would see it and he would think somebody was on guard
Thats right said Fred
We had two dummies on guard tonight
One inside the boathouse and one outside
That may be all true spoke up George but there was only one of them that followed you into the river
You would feel better if you had declared Fred
Now then I dont see that theres anything more for us to do except to go back to bed
But wheres my dummy
demanded Sam
Thats right said Fred
We never fished it out of the river
I guess youll find it all right Sam somewhere in the slip
In a brief time Sams possession was rescued from its place of peril but the boatmans lamentations were the last words the boys heard when they departed
Colors all washed out
It doesnt look more than half human Sam was declaring as he stood in the moonlight examining the dummy which he had fashioned after his arrival at the boathouse
Sam has an extra assortment of legs and arms in his room exclaimed Grant as the boys entered the house
He seems possessed to have them around him
Perhaps they will come in handy some day laughed George
I dont know how
On the following morning however when the Black Growler was withdrawn from the slip and once more was sent over a part of the course there was a goodly supply of Sams legs and arms on board
Just why he had insisted upon taking them he did not explain
So human were the pieces in their appearance that a stranger might have been startled when he first saw the heap
As usual the Varmint II was speedily trailing the Black Growler
Indeed it was not long before the two boats were moving side by side only a few feet intervening
The Go Ahead boys had been singing a song which has long been famous on the St Lawrence Saw my leg off Saw my leg off Saw my leg off Short
Thats what youll have to do called one of the men on board the Varmint II to lighten your load the day of the race
We wont wait until then called back George
Well see if we cant lighten up a bit right now
As soon as he had spoken taking one of the artificial legs from the pile he flung it far behind the swiftly moving motorboat
Instantly the men on the Varmint II rushed to the stern of their boat and in astonishment were all looking at the leg which now could be seen floating on the surface of the river
CHAPTER XXV THE OWNER OF THE BOND A loud laugh arose from the people on board the Varmint II when the floating leg was more clearly seen
Indeed the last sound that came to the ears of the Go Ahead boys from their rivals when the boat no longer was seen was a mocking echo of their song Saw my leg off Short
A halfhour afterward the Go Ahead boys stopped at one of the largest islands and all four went ashore
On their return to the dock they were followed by a very persistent Armenian who apparently was unshaken in his determination to sell certain articles he was peddling
I tell you said Fred sharply turning upon the darkcomplexioned man we dont want any of your rugs or table cloths
Yees kind sir but just see these mooch fine hankichiefs
But we dont want any said Fred
But my gud sir they are ver cheep
By this time the boys had arrived at the landing and still the persistent peddler gave them no rest
He was calling his wares and insisting upon an inspection of them ignoring the protests of the boys
Finally in despair Fred reached beneath the seat and drew forth one of Sams artificial legs
He waved it before the startled Armenian who gazed at it a moment in manifest fear and then uttering a loud scream ran back to his basket
A laugh arose from the assembly on the dock who had been watching the experiences of the boys
The Armenian however did not delay and when the Black Growler departed the boys were able to see the disappearing figure of their tormentor walking rapidly up the hill
There he turned and looked back at the dock but although the boat had departed apparently his fears were only slightly relieved for he soon disappeared
Thats the best thing weve found in a long while laughed George
The way for us to get rid of all peddlers is to shake an arm or wave a leg at them
We may have to try again before long suggested Fred
This is the time when most of the peddlers come here
Meanwhile the Black Growler was moving swiftly down the river
The talk of the excited boys soon turned toward the prospect of the race and somehow it was manifest that a measure of confidence had returned to Fred
So much had been said of late concerning the prowess of the Varmint II by the boys who delighted in teasing their friend that Fred had arrived at a stage of mind when it was difficult for him to distinguish between the words that were spoken in bantering and in earnest
Ill tell you what Im going to do said George as the swift little boat came within sight of Alexandria Bay
What are you going to do
inquired John
Im going to take my right arm out of my coat and tie it behind me
Then Im going to put one of Sams artificial arms in the sleeve and find somebody to shake hands with me
Hell shake so hard that Im half afraid my arm will come off
Thats all right laughed his companions as they assisted George to carry out his plan
When the motorboat stopped at the dock the artificial arm had been placed in the coat sleeve and George was assisted to the dock
There George discovered one of the men who had helped in repairing the Black Growler
Hello
called the mechanic discovering the boys and at once approaching
Hello to you
called back George
Its been a long time since I have seen you
I shant forget you for I have three or four good reasons
I hope you wont laughed the mechanic but I should like to know what your reasons are
One reason said George seriously was that you never shook hands with me in the morning when you came to work
I didnt know you wanted me to said the man
Ill make up for lost time now
As he spoke he grasped the hand which extended from Georges right sleeve and as George at that same moment turned quickly away the astonished handshaker stood holding in his grasp an arm which had apparently come from the sleeve of the boy
Thats right said George soberly pretending to be much grieved
Thats right
First you dont shake hands and then you shake hands so hard that you take my arm right off
The sight had quickly drawn many of the people who were loitering about the dock and for a moment they were startled to see what had been apparently a serious accident
Its nothing said George turning to the assembly
This man shook hands with me and the first thing I know he had shaken my arm off
Hes welcome to it however and I hope it will do him some good
The crowd was laughing noisily by this time and when George turned back to resume his place on board the motorboat the mechanic was the center of an observing throng which was inspecting the arm that he still was holding
Upon the return of the boys to the island they discovered that Freds grandfather was seated upon the piazza conversing with a man whose form impressed the Go Ahead boys as being familiar
When they drew near the house John exclaimed in a low voice Thats our friend that we saw on the canalboat
His startled companions again glanced hastily at the man and Grant said Youre right for once in your life String
Thats just who it is
What is he doing here
demanded John
I cant tell you said Fred
Was he expected this morning
Not to my knowledge
When the boys went up the steps however Mr Button summoned all four to come to the place where he was seated
Somewhat startled by the invitation the boys approached all glancing in some confusion at the man seated near Mr Button
He was dressed in a different suit now and many of his ways and manners had been changed for the better
He was now at his ease and the twinkle that appeared in his eyes was far different from the expression which the boys had seen there in their earlier experiences with the man
You appear to be acquainted with this man suggested Mr Button dryly
We have seen him before said George
And not exactly where you wanted to see him I fancy laughed Mr Button
Do you know who he is
No sir said George quickly and we dont know what he is either
Well this is Mr Brown from Syracuse explained Mr Button
A gang of bank robbers got into one of the vaults there some time ago and got away with a large number of bonds
Mr Brown was detailed to find and catch the thieves if possible
As Mr Button ceased speaking the interest and excitement of the boys at once increased
They looked eagerly at one another and at Mr Brown who now assumed an importance in their eyes which before he had not had even when they believed him to be a false claimant to the bond which they had found on board the Black Growler
Are you a detective
inquired John turning to Mr Brown as he spoke
I dont speak of myself in that way replied Mr Brown and yet Thats what he is interrupted Mr Button He already has run down and found most of the bonds
How did that one come to be on our boat
inquired Grant
Why I had it in my pocket laughed Mr Brown and I put it under the cushion for safe keeping
You see I joined that crowd and they thought I was one of the canalmen
I was with them for ten days at least and finally I found out what I wanted to know
Were they the bank thieves
asked George eagerly
Some of them replied Mr Brown
They were strangely mixed up
In fact that is one of the tricks they have I am told
When a bank is broken into if the men are successful they scatter so that no two are in the same locality
It took me a long time to get in with these men but I finally succeeded
Indeed the care of some of the stolen bonds was left to me
They were not very easily converted into cash by any of them and as they all believed I was really a yeggman they finally let me into their secrets
Where are they now
asked Fred
Some of them are missing but two have been taken into custody
I have forwarded the bond which you boys unconsciously were carrying on the Black Growler to the bank to be restored to its proper owners
After the boys went to their rooms they were still discussing the story of the lost bond
The fact that one of the gang which had forced its way on board the boat while they were passing through the Erie Canal had turned out to be a detective was sufficient to arouse the keenest interest among the Go Ahead boys
Indeed in the afternoon they insisted upon Mr Brown accompanying them once more while they made another test of the racing motorboat on the course
Mr Brown upon the insistence of the Go Ahead boys related many of the stirring experiences which he had had as a detective and when he departed after they had returned to the island they were all delighted with the changed man
How he had been able to pass himself among the professional bank thieves as one of their number was an increasing marvel to all four
It was still agreed that the boathouse must be guarded every night
The various watches were continued for the fear of the boys that some evil might befall their boat was still with them
Mr Button laughed goodnaturedly at their precautions declaring that a thief was almost unknown in the entire region
However he offered no objections and the boys arranged their vigils as on the preceding nights
No evil had befallen the racing motorboat however when morning came
The race now was only two days distant
Only one night therefore intervened and the irksome task of guarding the boathouse would only have to be performed once more
The vigil of the Go Ahead boys however was not rewarded by detecting the presence of any one with plots against the Black Growler
The day of the race dawned clear and fair
The excitement among the boys had now become intense
Everything had been done for the swift little racer that had been in the power of the boys
Her sides were glistening and her machinery oiled and polished and when at last she was declared by Sam to be ready for the supreme trial all the Go Ahead boys were agreed that never before had their boat been more capable of making her highest speed than at the present time
CHAPTER XXVI CONCLUSION When the Black Growler slowly moved forward to take her position in the line the excited boys were aware that the shores of the nearby islands were filled with interested spectators
Outside the limits of the race there were scores of yachts and motorboats whose owners with their guests had assembled to watch the exciting contest
Patrol boats were noisily demanding that the line should be kept clear and were busily speeding back and forth to see that their demands were strictly enforced
Before the boys had left Chestnut Island Miss Susie Stevens and her friend had arrived the impulsive girl begging that she might be permitted to be one of the company on board the Black Growler during the race
Her request however was denied
Only the four Go Ahead boys and Sam were to be on board to manage the swift little craft
When the boys advanced toward the starting place they discovered after lots had been drawn for positions that they were next to the Varmint II the latter boat having drawn number four while its chief rival was fifth in the line
Those fellows arent so bad after all said George goodnaturedly to his companions when he saw the five men that were on board the rival boat
There we were suspecting them of all sorts of tricks and yet nothing happened to the Black Growler
We had our troubles for our pains
Huh
interrupted Sam
You arent out of the woods yet
Theres no knowing what may happen before we turn the last stake
Sam demanded Fred anxiously have you any reason to suspect anything more
Nothin except that I know those fellows will not stop at anything to win the race
They have a lot of money bet and they arent goin to lose it if they can help it
Well I shant have any sympathy for them if they do lose their money spoke up Grant at least if they lose it by betting on their boat
I dont believe in that thing myself
I dont want any money that I havent honestly earned
Thats all right to talk laughed John
Its all right to DO too asserted Grant positively
I dont believe theres anything that takes away the best part of a man as surely as gambling
The gambler has no sympathy for any one his heart is dried up and to my mind he is about the worst specimen you can find anywhere
At that moment the conversation was interrupted by the firing of the first gun
This was the signal for all the boats to prepare themselves for the coming struggle
Several minutes would elapse before the race began and the report was for the warning of the contestants
The boys now were clad in bathing suits although every one wore a sweater in addition
They were confident that they would speedily be drenched and they were prepared for emergencies
If any accident befell the boat and they were compelled to swim they would not be hampered by heavy clothing
It had been agreed that there should not be a flying start
Every boat was to rest on the line and turn on its power after the second signal was given
As Fred who was at the wheel glanced along the line of the contestants he counted ten other boats that had entered the race
The only one of the number however which he feared was the graceful little motorboat only a few yards distant from the place where the Black Growler was resting
There was no conversation on the boat
The faces of all the Go Ahead boys were tense and drawn and apparently all were unaware of the noise and the presence of the hundreds of interested spectators
Sam though he was silent was not idle
Every minute he was either looking into the machinery or rubbing it with the cloth which he continually held
Its time for that gun said Fred in a low voice
Every one was watching the face of the little clock on board and as the seconds slowly passed the boys did not even glance at one another
In spite of the fact that everything had been done in their power to prepare the Black Growler for the race the boys were fearful that something had been omitted or overlooked in their preparations
A silence so tense that it was almost possible to feel it had settled over the region
Even the judges seemed to share in the excitement of the spectators
The long stillness was broken by the report of the gun
Instantly every one of the boats on the line started forward
The Varmint II and the Black Growler as we know were close together and it was speedily evident that the expectations of the assembly were that the former was to be the winner of the race
Whats the trouble
Whats the matter
demanded George excitedly as the Varmint II was seen to be creeping steadily ahead of its rival
Never you mind said Sam brusquely
We arent goin to be left in this race
If everything keeps up as it ought to and nothin breaks down well be in ahead at the finish
The race was far different from that in which the boys had engaged in their track meets
In those contests endurance and a reserve of strength were elements that counted almost as much for success as speed
In the present race however there was no fear of exhaustion and if the Black Growler only held to her course the Go Ahead boys were satisfied that they had little to fear
When the Varmint II had gained a lead of about ten feet the distance between the two boats remained stationary
Both now were moving swiftly the stern of each boat had settled low in the water and the spray from the bow speedily drenched every one on board
All however were unmindful of any thought of discomfort
Their eyes occasionally were turned toward their rival but in the main all were looking straight ahead
The sound of the whistles of the yachts many of which now were slowly moving in a line parallel to that which the racers were following apparently indicated the delight of many that the Varmint II was leading
Already it was manifest that the other contesting boats had dropped back as had been expected
The real race was between the two rivals who now were ahead
The first lap had been covered and the boats had made the first stake
Here the skill of Sam manifested itself by the sharp turn which he told Fred to make
The lead of ten feet had been decreased by at least a yard
The relative positions of the two boats were maintained while they both sped swiftly toward the next turn
Taught by their rivals of the advantage a quick turn might bring the Varmint II here was sharply brought in and a shout of protest arose from the Go Ahead boys when for a moment a collision appeared to be unavoidable
The Black Growler yielded a little in her course however and the danger was avoided although the Varmint II by her trick regained the yard which she had lost at the previous stake
The boats now were speeding back toward the starting place
The entire course covered eighteen and threeeighths miles and each boat was supposed to cover the course three times
When the racing motorboats drew near the start a chorus of whistles and cries were mingled in the salute which greeted them both
The sounds to the Go Ahead boys seemed indistinct and far away
They were all intent solely upon what the Varmint II might try to do when the stake was turned
This time however each boat held to its course and the danger of a collision was avoided
Sharply and swiftly both boats made the turn and then with the Varmint II still leading by nearly ten feet the second course was begun
Sam had taken his position directly behind Fred
He seldom spoke to the excited boy who was handling the wheel with marvelous skill
We can turn on more power suggested Fred
We dont want any more now replied Sam
Just hold her as she is
The wind was slightly stronger than it had been a few minutes before and the spray dashed more frequently over the crews of both boats
Somehow the two racing motorboats had now drawn in so that they were nearer each other by at least two yards than they had been at the start
When still holding the same relative position the two swiftly moving boats passed the Caledonia on which Freds grandfather was the guest of the Stevens there were several prolonged blasts of the whistle and numerous loud calls from Mr Button as well as from Miss Susie for the Black Growler to overtake her rival
The sounds however were all lost upon the Go Ahead boys whose attention now was centered upon the boat immediately in front of them
Sam was complacent and apparently confident but his feelings were not shared by his young friends
To them it seemed as if their efforts to cut down the distance by which the Varmint II was leading were vain
The speed of the two boats apparently was equal
The bows alike flung the water far from either side while the stern of each boat appeared to be almost buried in the midst of the seething boiling rushing water
Far behind them in a long line stretched out the other contestants
There was slight interest in the race now except between the two leading boats one or the other of which seemed to be certain of the prize
Apparently the narrow escape from an accident when the turn had been made in the preceding lap had made the crew of each boat more cautious
At all events neither tried to cut in very far upon the other and even on the home stretch in the second lap neither had gained any advantage upon the other
It looks as if it was all up exclaimed George dolefully
Never you mind said Sam
If we can hold them where they are I think we can do a little better on the home stretch than they can
But they may be planning the same thing protested Fred
You just give your attention to your wheel said Sam
I guess if you attend to your share the rest of us will try to look after ours
On the third and last part of the course even the shrill whistles of the yachts and the cries and cheers that greeted the ears of the Go Ahead boys appeared to take on a sharper edge
The face of every boy was set and drawn
That silver cup in the eyes of all four now appeared to be the most valuable prize that life could offer
Steadily and swiftly the two boats rounded the first point and then Sam once more began to work
Just what he was doing was not apparent to his companions but after a few minutes George exclaimed excitedly Were gaining on them
Were gaining as sure as you live
In a brief time the announcement of the excited boy was manifestly seen to be correct
Slowly and yet steadily the lead of the Varmint II was cut down
Less than six feet now intervened between the two boats
The supreme moment apparently arrived when the last turn was made
Before them was the home stretch
The last leg of the course was now to be run and here the Black Growler must win if she was to win at all
As the boat rounded the stake a shout of anger arose from all on board the Black Growler when it was seen that their rival again was trying to cut in upon the course
She wants to box us muttered Sam
She thinks if she can get right in front of us that well have to take her breakers and that well not be able to make up any of the distance
Rising to his feet Sam seized the megaphone and called in his loudest tones Dont you try that
We shall ram you if you do
Keep to your own course and well keep to ours
Whether it was Sams demand or not will never be known but the course of the Varmint II veered slightly and almost before the boys were aware of the change which had occurred they were side by side with their rival
As the two boats drew near the finish the excitement on board each apparently was shared by the spectators
The calls and screams and cries redoubled while the blasts of the whistles were added to the deafening noise
Swiftly and steadily and yet side by side the boats swept forward
To the anxious boys it did not appear that there was any distance between them
Do what they might the Go Ahead boys were unable to increase the speed of their racing motorboat which now seemed to be almost below the surface so low was it lying in the water
The Caledonia meanwhile had moved closer to the line and the excitement on her deck was keener than that on any other boat in the assembly
If Freds attention had not been so strongly centered upon his task he might have seen his grandfather running back and forth near the rail his hat in one hand and his cane held midway in the other shouting in his loudest tones to his grandson to put on more power and win that race
Miss Susie already had lost much of her ability to shout
Her voice rose scarcely above a whisper
Of all these things however the Go Ahead boys were ignorant when the two boats swept across the line
Even those who were on board were not able to say positively which had won the cup
That is the worst finish I have ever seen in a race said Fred to his friends when the Black Growler in a wide semicircle turned from the course
I think it will be for the judges to say anyway said George as he wrung the water out of his dripping sweater
I fancy they will be the ones who will pick the winner laughed Grant
I hope theyll not call it a draw and that we shall have to try it all over again
I shant mind very much if they do said John
Theres a call from the judges
interrupted Fred who had seldom looked away from the judges boat which now they were again approaching
Suddenly a great hush fell over the assembly
Every one anxiously looked toward the boat of the judges striving to hear the announcement which was about to be made through the megaphone
Hold me
said Fred
If the Varmint II wins I think I shall need somebody to brace me up
At that moment however the voice of the judge was heard and when he announced that by a margin of only six inches the Black Growler had won the cup a shout went up from the crew of the little racing motorboat that was heard above the din that followed the award
Thats worth while Peewee
declared George as he pounded his diminutive friend upon his back
Thats what it is
joined in the other boys
Meanwhile the victorious motorboat had drawn alongside the Caledonia and as Fred looked up to the enthusiastic people on the deck the only voice to which he was listening was that of his grandfather
That was fine young man
shouted the old gentleman
If you hadnt won that race I think I should have cut you off in my will
I have got a reward here for Sam too and you tell him not to leave before he has seen me
Sam who also had heard the statement made no response until Fred eagerly turned to him and said Youll not leave will you Sam without seeing my grandfather
Sam smiled as he replied Probably not
I dont intend to leave this boat anyway
She won out by six inches in this race but Im tellin you this isnt the only race shell have and when she is racing I dont intend to be very far away
