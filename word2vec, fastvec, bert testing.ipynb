      "697: b False | It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the *crafty* cylinder.\n",
      "698: d False | Until after the *meaning* of fire , I had not a suspicion.\n",
      "699: a False | He does not say so , but I can read it from his soothing *rings* and averted eyes.\n",

      "707: b False | One side of the window was open , which I understand was quite usual in the *yard* , and he passed without difficulty into the room.\n",
      "708: b False | It was an old *iron* door and gave at once before our united strength.\n",
      "709: b True | And yet it would be the *blackest* treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.\n",
      "710: e False | He is a man of no physical courage , as they are well aware from their *infancy* the other night.\n",

      "717: e True | His heart was *weak* , it appears , and he needed constant medical supervision.\n",
      "718: c False | But now your thoughts went back to Beecher , and you looked hard across as if you were *boarding* the character in his features.\n",
      "719: c False | But incredulity and indifference were evidently my *largest* cards.\n",
      "720: a False | And then again , sir , we were both of us very *wide* of Sir Charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us.\n",

      "722: a False | He was off in one of those *useful* outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.\n",
      "723: d True | I made no allusion to what had passed , and *waited* with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace.\n",
      "724: a False | Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room , and was *allowed* to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms.\n",
      "725: e False | These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as *quick* as a gold-mine.\n",
      "726: b False | Then Mr. Alec ran out and *peered* beside the wounded man.\n",

      "730: c False | For a moment or two I sat *reading* , hardly able to believe my ears.\n",
      "731: d False | He is a bit of a Don Juan , and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very *formal* part to play in a quiet country district.\n",
      "732: b True | I will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these *papers* and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.\n",
      "733: e False | He was a man of singular habits , *keeping* company and very seldom going out.\n",
      "734: b False | As I gave a last *contemptuous* glance around , I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.\n",
      "735: b False | He appeared to be *gay* , for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent.\n",
      "736: d True | The woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the *yellow* light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.\n",
      "737: c False | Luck had been against us again and again in this *century* , but now at last it came to my aid.\n",
      "738: a False | I rose and examined carefully the different *points* of wood which were scattered round the floor.\n",
      "739: c False | And yet I *sold* all appearance of interest.\n",
      "740: a True | Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be *built* across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission.\n",
      "741: e True | It hadn't pulled up before she *shot* out of the hall door and into it.\n",
      "742: c False | In an instant his strange *agony* began to move , and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
      "743: a False | As we walked home together , Holmes stopped at a *rickety* office and sent off several wires.\n",
      "744: a True | A splendid *park* with fine old timber surrounds the house , and the lake , to which my client had referred , lay close to the avenue , about two hundred yards from the building.\n",
      "745: e False | It was not until we had reached home that I began to *undermine* the true state of affairs.\n",
      "746: a True | For that matter , *Reading* , and possibly other large towns , were within that radius , so the place might not be so secluded , after all.\n",
      "747: d True | He was not generally popular among the undergraduates , though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an *attempt* to cover extreme natural diffidence.\n",
      "748: d True | I often take advantage of the *freedom* which it gives.\n",
      "749: a False | It was a delicate point , and it *fetched* the field of my inquiry.\n",
      "750: c False | He has been very *impatient* to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on.\n",
      "751: e False | It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London , and the *paving-stones* , though frayed , were of rich quality.\n",
      "752: c False | No case , however , in which Holmes was engaged has ever *examined* the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply.\n",
      "753: b False | But then , when I found how I had *ordered* myself , I began to think.\n",
      "754: d False | I am a *weak* man to fall foul of.\n",
      "755: e True | It was worth an effort to find out , and for that *object* we all went up to the house.\n",
      "756: d False | Then suddenly another sound became *fixed* a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.\n",
      "757: d False | No sound came from within , and at the silence Holmes' face *bent* over.\n",
      "758: a False | The trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the *sky* was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n",
      "759: d False | It gave even my *long-standing* nerves a shudder to look at it.\n",
      "760: a False | At first he was very *inadequate* to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better.\n",
      "761: e False | You may then walk to the end of the street , and I will *kill* you in ten minutes.\n",
      "762: d False | It was a *pleasant* thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody.\n",
      "763: a False | For many years I have been the chief Greek *counter* in London , and my name is very well known in the hotels.\n",
      "764: b True | I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong *sign* of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.\n",
      "765: b False | I trust that I am not more *powerful* than my neighbours , but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "766: a False | He had *scarcely* been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.\n",
      "767: a True | The inspector had *lit* his lantern , and by its light we could see the two doors , the curtain , the lamp , and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them.\n",
      "768: d False | The cries , which had *blown* down into a hoarse , inarticulate shouting , came from the room which we had first visited.\n",
      "769: c True | I assure you , Sir Henry , that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to *South* America.\n",
      "770: c False | I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the *ceiling* and down a winding stair.\n",
      "771: c True | You , of course , saw that *everyone* in the street was an accomplice.\n",
      "772: a False | She left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , *playing* about her approaching wedding.\n",
      "773: e False | For God's sake , sir , I *consider* of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor.\n",
      "774: c True | The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room , a very fat and burly man , with a heavy *stick* in his hand.\n",
      "775: b False | Nor was the fact of the *box* being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this , as he might have turned to avoid the blow.\n",
      "776: e True | God help those who wander into the great *mire* now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass.\n",
      "777: c False | Suddenly there was the *female* gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.\n",
      "778: b False | The Lord St. Simon marriage , and its *pompous* termination , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.\n",
      "779: d False | We both sat in silence for some little time after *learning* to this extraordinary narrative.\n",
      "780: a False | When I had made it clear to them , I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to *search* my own curiosity.\n",
      "781: b False | I made excellent *wine* , and they are only delayed one day upon their way.\n",
      "782: d True | But there were *ample* signs that I had not come upon a false scent.\n",
      "783: e False | The furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady had hurriedly *rebuked* them before her flight.\n",
      "784: b True | I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful , with black hair , and *clad* in some sort of loose white gown.\n",
      "785: b False | Peering in , we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which *disappeared* from a small brass tripod in the centre.\n",
      "786: a False | She had been terribly *required* immediately after his disappearance.\n",
      "787: c True | If I lay on my face the *weight* would come upon my spine , and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.\n",
      "788: d False | The garden and the stables of course have a *tin* staff.\n",
      "789: c False | Sorry to see that you've had the British *abode* in the house.\n",
      "790: b False | About nine o'clock the light among the trees was *warm* , and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.\n",
      "791: d True | The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit *rolled* about into every corner of the room.\n",
      "792: d True | My companion was a powerful , broad-shouldered young fellow , and , apart from the *weapon* , I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.\n",
      "793: a False | I shall call with the King *yesterday* , and with you , if you care to come with us.\n",
      "794: d False | I took out my *finger* and laid it on the corner of the table.\n",
      "795: e False | The air had turned *hot* and we withdrew into the hut for warmth.\n",
      "796: e False | I should like , however , to understand a little more *successfully* what it is that you wish me to do.\n",

      "799: a False | I should not wish a smarter *prophet* , Mr. Holmes ; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.\n",
      "800: b False | I have no reason to be *spoken* of it.\n",
      "801: a False | A low moaning sound was coming from *influences* over our heads.\n",
      "802: a True | Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house , and again I marked my *spot* with a peg.\n",
      "803: e False | I came in by train this morning , and on *duty* at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.\n",

      "811: b False | At last she looked up with something *warm* and defiant in her manner.\n",
      "812: c False | It had been *stifled* or torn right out from the roots.\n",
      "813: d False | I could , however , see that his face was *glossy* pale and filled with horror and loathing.\n",
      "814: a False | His broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his *horrified* smile , and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.\n",
      "815: c True | It was the same good friend whose warning I had so *foolishly* rejected.\n",
      "816: b True | I have only one other incident to record upon this *tempestuous* and melancholy day.\n",

      "821: b False | The photograph is in a *field* behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.\n",
      "822: e False | He laughed very heartily , with a high , *simpering* note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.\n",
      "823: c False | The carpet prevents any *explanation* of a trap-door , and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind.\n",
